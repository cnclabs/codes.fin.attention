the following discussion includes references to our performance measures  operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders  that are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
operating earnings is the measure of segment profit or loss we use to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources 
consistent with gaap accounting guidance for segment reporting  operating earnings is our measure of segment performance 
operating earnings is also a measure by which senior management s and many other employees performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans 
operating earnings is defined as operating revenues less operating expenses  both net of income tax 
operating earnings available to common shareholders is defined as operating earnings less preferred stock dividends 
operating revenues and operating expenses exclude results of discontinued operations and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by metlife  inc divested businesses 
operating revenues also excludes net investment gains losses and net derivative gains losses 
the following additional adjustments are made to gaap revenues  in the line items indicated  in calculating operating revenues universal life and investment type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains losses and net derivative gains losses and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib fees gmib fees  net investment income i includes amounts for scheduled periodic settlement payments and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  ii includes income from discontinued real estate operations  iii excludes post tax operating earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method  iv excludes certain amounts related to contractholder directed unit linked investments  and v excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities vies consolidated under gaap  and other revenues are adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges

we believe the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders as we measure it for management purposes enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business 
operating revenues  operating expenses  operating earnings  and operating earnings available to common shareholders  should not be viewed as substitutes for the following financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap gaap revenues  gaap expenses  gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  and gaap net income loss available to metlife  inc s common shareholders  respectively 
reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures are included in results of operations 
in  management modified its definition of operating earnings to exclude the impacts of divested businesses  which includes certain operations of metlife bank  national association metlife bank and our insurance operations in the caribbean region  panama and costa rica the caribbean business  as these results are not relevant to understanding the company s ongoing operating results 
consequently  prior years results for corporate other and total consolidated operating earnings have been decreased by million  net of million of income tax  and million  net of million of income tax  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  in  management modified its definition of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders to exclude impacts related to certain variable annuity guarantees and market value adjustments to better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business 
accordingly  such results are no longer reported in operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders 
consequently  prior years results for retirement products and total consolidated operating earnings have been increased by million  net of million of income tax  and million  net of million of income tax  for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents in this discussion  we sometimes refer to sales activity for various products 
these sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under gaap  but are used as relevant measures of business activity 
additionally  the impact of changes in our foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current year and is applied to each of the comparable years

see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we continue to experience an increase in market share and sales in several of our businesses  however  the general economic conditions  including the high levels of unemployment  negatively impacted the demand for certain of our products 
portfolio growth in response to the higher sales levels drove improved investment results despite lower yields experienced in connection with the continued decline in interest rates in the declining interest rate environment  however  also generated significant derivative gains in current year results were negatively impacted by severe weather  including the earthquake and tsunami in japan in the first quarter  record numbers of tornadoes in the second quarter and hurricane irene in the third quarter 
years ended december  in millions income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax less net investment gains losses less net derivative gains losses less other adjustments to continuing operations less provision for income tax expense benefit operating earnings less preferred stock dividends operating earnings available to common shareholders see definitions of operating revenues and operating expenses for the components of such adjustments 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts discussed below are net of income tax 
during the year ended december   income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  increased billion to billion from billion in the change was predominantly due to a billion favorable change in net derivative gains losses  before income tax  and a billion favorable change in operating earnings available to common shareholders  which includes the impact of the acquisition 
the favorable change in net derivative gains losses of billion was primarily driven by favorable changes in freestanding derivatives  partially offset by unfavorable changes in embedded derivatives 
the favorable change in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to the impact of falling long term and mid term interest rates and equity market movements and volatility 
the acquisition drove the majority of the billion increase in operating earnings available to common shareholders 
in addition  improved investment performance was the result of portfolio growth in response to increased sales across many of our businesses  which more than offset the negative impact of the declining interest rate environment on yields 
current year results were negatively impacted by severe weather  as well as  in the third quarter  a charge to increase reserves in connection with the company s use of the us social security administration s death master file and similar databases to identify potential life insurance claims that have not been presented to the company death master file and expenses incurred related to a liquidation plan filed by the new york state department of financial services the department of financial services for executive life insurance company of new york elny 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  unless otherwise stated  all amounts discussed below are net of income tax 
during the year ended december   metlife s income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax increased billion to a gain of billion from a loss of billion in  of which million in losses is from the inclusion of alico results for one month in and the impact of financing costs for the 
table of contents acquisition 
the change was predominantly due to a billion favorable change in net derivative gains losses  before income tax  and a billion favorable change in net investment gains losses  before income tax 
offsetting these favorable variances were unfavorable changes in adjustments related to continuing operations of billion  before income tax  and billion of income tax  resulting in a total favorable variance of billion 
in addition  operating earnings available to common shareholders increased billion to billion in from billion in the favorable change in net derivative gains losses of billion was primarily driven by net gains on freestanding derivatives in compared to net losses in  partially offset by an unfavorable change in embedded derivatives from gains in to losses in the favorable change in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors  including falling long term and mid term interest rates  a stronger recovery in equity markets in than  equity volatility  which decreased more in as compared to  a strengthening us dollar and widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services sector 
the favorable change in net investment gains losses of billion was primarily driven by a decrease in impairments and a decrease in the provision for credit losses on mortgage loans 
these favorable changes in net derivative and net investment gains losses were partially offset by an unfavorable change of million in related adjustments 
the improvement in the financial markets  which began in the second quarter of and continued into  was a key driver of the billion increase in operating earnings available to common shareholders 
such market improvement was most evident in higher net investment income and policy fees  as well as a decrease in variable annuity guarantee benefit costs 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in amortization of dac  voba and deferred sales inducements dsi as a result of an increase in average separate account balances and higher gross margins in the closed block driven by increased investment yields and the impact of dividend scale reductions 
the period also includes one month of alico results  contributing million to the increase in operating earnings 
the favorable impact of a reduction in discretionary spending associated with our enterprise wide cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative was more than offset by an increase in other expenses related to our other international regions segment 
this increase primarily stemmed from the impact of a benefit recorded in the prior year related to the pesification in argentina  as well as current year business growth in the segment 
consolidated company outlook in  we expect a solid improvement in the operating earnings of the company over  driven primarily by the following premiums  fees and other revenues growth in is expected to be driven by rational pricing strategy in the group insurance marketplace 
higher fees earned on separate accounts primarily due to favorable net flows of variable annuities  which are expected to remain strong in  thereby increasing the value of those separate accounts  and increases in our international businesses  notably accident and health  from continuing organic growth throughout our various geographic regions 
focus on disciplined underwriting 
we see no significant changes to the underlying trends that drive underwriting results and continue to anticipate solid results in  however  unanticipated catastrophes  similar to those that occurred during  could result in a high volume of weather related claims 
focus on expense management 
we continue to focus on expense control throughout the company  and managing the costs associated with the integration of alico 
continued disciplined approach to investing and asset liability management  including significant hedging to protect against low interest rates 

table of contents as a result of new financial accounting guidance for dac which we intend to adopt in the first quarter of  we estimate that  on the date of adoption  dac will be reduced by approximately billion to billion and total equity will be reduced by approximately billion to billion  net of income tax 
additionally  we estimate that there will be a negative impact on our operating earnings primarily in japan  with no impact on our on going cash flows 
the company plans to apply this accounting change retrospectively to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements for all insurance contracts 
we expect only modest investment losses in  but more difficult to predict is the impact of potential changes in fair value of freestanding and embedded derivatives as even relatively small movements in market variables  including interest rates  equity levels and volatility  can have a large impact on the fair value of derivatives and net derivative gains losses 
additionally  changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain insurance liabilities may have a material impact on net derivative gains losses related to the inclusion of an adjustment for nonperformance risk 
industry trends we continue to be impacted by the unstable global financial and economic environment that has been affecting the industry 
financial and economic environment 
our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally 
stressed conditions  volatility and disruptions in global capital markets  particular markets  or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us  in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors 
global market factors  including interest rates  credit spreads  equity prices  real estate markets  foreign currency exchange rates  consumer spending  business investment  government spending  the volatility and strength of the capital markets  deflation and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and  ultimately  the amount and profitability of our business 
disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes 
upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our business through their effects on general levels of economic activity  employment and customer behavior 
while our diversified business mix and geographically diverse business operations partially mitigate these risks  correlation across regions  countries and global market factors may reduce the benefits of diversification 
beginning in and continuing throughout  concerns increased about capital markets and the solvency of certain european union member states  including portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain europe s perimeter region  and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to their sovereign debt 
see investments current environment for information regarding credit ratings downgrades and support programs for europe s perimeter region 
these ratings downgrades and implementation of european union and private sector support programs have increased concerns that other european union member states could experience similar financial troubles  that some countries could default on their obligation or have to restructure their outstanding debt  that financial institutions with significant holdings of sovereign or private debt issued by borrowers in peripheral european countries could experience financial stress  or that one or more countries may exit the euro zone  any of which could have significant adverse effects on the european and global economies and on financial markets  generally 
see risk factors we are exposed to significant financial and capital markets risk which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and may cause our net investment income to vary from period to period 
although the downgrade by standard poor s ratings services s p of us treasury securities initially had an adverse effect on financial markets  the extent of the longer term impact cannot be predicted 
fitch ratings fitch warned that it may in the future downgrade the us credit rating unless action is taken to reduce the national debt of the us see risk factors concerns over us fiscal policy and the trajectory of the national debt of the us  as well as rating agency downgrades of us treasury securities  could have an 
table of contents adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see also investments current environment for further information about european region support programs announced in july and october  ratings actions and our exposure to obligations of european governments and private obligors 
all of these factors have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on the financial results of companies in the financial services industry  including metlife 
such global economic conditions  as well as the global financial markets  continue to impact our net investment income  our net investment and net derivative gains losses  and the demand for and the cost and profitability of certain of our products  including variable annuities and guarantee benefits 
see results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
as a financial holding company with significant operations in the us  we are affected by the monetary policy of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new york the frb of ny and  collectively with the federal reserve board  the federal reserve 
the federal reserve board has taken a number of actions in recent years to spur economic activity by keeping interest rates low and may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future  which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk bearing investments  and may adversely impact the level of product sales 
in january  the federal reserve board announced its plans to keep interest rates low until at least through late  months longer than previously planned in order to revive the slow recovery from stressed economic conditions 
see risk factors governmental and regulatory actions for the purpose of stabilizing and revitalizing the financial markets and protecting investors and consumers may not achieve the intended effect or could adversely affect our competitive position and investments current environment 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 
we believe that the turbulence in financial markets that began in the second half of  its impact on the capital position of many competitors  and subsequent actions by regulators and rating agencies have highlighted financial strength as a significant differentiator from the perspective of customers and certain distributors 
in addition  the financial market turbulence and the economic recession have led many companies in our industry to re examine the pricing and features of the products they offer and may lead to consolidation in the life insurance industry 
regulatory changes 
the us life insurance industry is regulated primarily at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the statutory reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products 
the regulation of the financial services industry in the us and internationally has received renewed scrutiny as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets 
significant regulatory reforms have been recently adopted and additional reforms proposed  and these or other reforms could be implemented 
see business us regulation  business international regulation  risk factors our insurance  brokerage and banking businesses are highly regulated  and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth and risk factors changes in us federal and state securities laws and regulations  and state insurance regulations regarding suitability of annuity product sales  may affect our operations and our profitability 

table of contents the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank  which was signed by president obama in july  effected the most far reaching overhaul of financial regulation in the us in decades 
the full impact of dodd frank on us will depend on the numerous rulemaking initiatives required or permitted by dodd frank which are scheduled to be completed over the next few years 
see business us regulation dodd frank and other legislative and regulatory developments and risk factors various aspects of dodd frank could impact our business operations  capital requirements and profitability and limit our growth 
as a federally chartered national banking association  metlife bank is subject to a wide variety of banking laws  regulations and guidelines  as is metlife  inc  as a bank holding company 
see business us regulation banking regulation and business us regulation financial holding company regulation 
in december  metlife bank and metlife  inc entered into a definitive agreement to sell most of the depository business of metlife bank 
in january  metlife  inc announced it is exiting the business of originating forward residential mortgages 
once metlife bank has completely exited its depository business  metlife  inc plans to terminate metlife bank s fdic insurance  putting metlife  inc in a position to be able to deregister as a bank holding company 
upon completion of the foregoing  metlife  inc will no longer be regulated as a bank holding company or subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards as a bank holding company with assets of billion or more 
however  if  in the future  metlife  inc is designated by the financial stability oversight council fsoc as a non bank systemically important financial institution as discussed below  it could once again be subject to regulation by the federal reserve and enhanced supervision and prudential standards  such as regulation yy as discussed below 
in october  the fsoc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking  outlining the process it will follow and the criteria it will use to assess whether a non bank financial company should be subject to enhanced supervision by the federal reserve as a non bank systemically important financial institution 
if metlife  inc meets the quantitative thresholds set forth in the proposal  the fsoc will continue with a further analysis using qualitative and quantitative factors 
in december  the basel committee on banking supervision published its final rules for increased capital and liquidity requirements commonly referred to as basel iii for bank holding companies  such as metlife  inc assuming these requirements are endorsed and adopted by the us banking regulators  they are to be phased in beginning january  it is possible that even more stringent capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed under basel iii  dodd frank and regulation yy  as long as metlife  inc remains a bank holding company or if  in the future  it is designated by the fsoc as a non bank systemically important financial institution 
the basel committee has also published rules requiring a capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks  which are to be phased in beginning january if they are endorsed and adopted by the us banking regulators 
as currently proposed  this surcharge would not apply to global non bank systemically important financial institutions 
however  international regulatory bodies are currently engaged in evaluating standards to identify such companies and to develop a regulatory regime that would apply to them  which may include enhanced capital requirements or other measures 
the ability of metlife bank and metlife  inc to pay dividends  repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital or need for capital could be reduced by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the enactment of dodd frank  regulation yy and or the endorsement and adoption by the us of basel iii and other regulatory initiatives 
see risk factors our insurance  brokerage and banking businesses are highly regulated  and changes in regulation and in supervisory and enforcement policies may reduce our profitability and limit our growth 
in april  the federal reserve board and the fdic proposed a rule regarding the implementation of the dodd frank requirement that i each non bank financial company designated by the fsoc for enhanced supervision by the federal reserve board a non bank systemically important financial institution or non bank sifi and each bank holding company with assets of billion or more report periodically to the federal reserve board  the fdic and the fsoc the plan of such company for rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure  and ii that each such company report on the nature and extent of credit exposures of such company to significant bank holding companies and significant non bank financial companies

in november  the federal reserve board and the fdic adopted a final rule implementing the resolution plan requirement  effective november   but deferred finalizing the credit exposure reporting requirement until a later date 
if metlife  inc remains a bank holding company on july   or if  in the future  it is designated by the fsoc as a non bank sifi  it would be required to submit a resolution plan 
see business us regulation dodd frank and other legislative and regulatory developments orderly liquidation authority 
in december  the federal reserve board issued a release proposing the adoption of enhanced prudential standards required by dodd frank regulation yy 
regulation yy would apply to bank holding companies with assets of billion or more and non bank sifis 
regulation yy would impose i enhanced risk based capital rbc requirements  ii leverage limits  iii liquidity requirements  iv single counterparty exposure limits  v governance requirements for risk management  vi stress test requirements  and vii special debt to equity limits for certain companies  and would establish a procedure for early remediation based on the failure to comply with these requirements 
as proposed  regulation yy would apply the same enhanced regulatory standards to non bank systemically important financial institutions as would apply to systemically important banks  the federal reserve board has solicited comments on the appropriateness of this treatment

mortgage and foreclosure related exposures in  metlife bank acquired certain assets to enter the forward and reverse residential mortgage origination and servicing business  including rights to service residential mortgage loans 
at various times since then  including most recently in the third quarter of  metlife bank has acquired additional residential mortgage loan servicing rights 
on january   metlife  inc announced that it is exiting the business of originating forward residential mortgages  but will continue to service its current mortgage customers 
as an originator and servicer of mortgage loans  which are usually sold to an investor shortly after origination  metlife bank has obligations to repurchase loans or compensate for losses upon demand by the investor due to defects in servicing of the loans or a determination that material representations made in connection with the sale of the loans relating  for example  to the underwriting and origination of the loans are incorrect 
metlife bank is indemnified by the sellers of the acquired assets  for various periods depending on the transaction and the nature of the claim  for origination and servicing deficiencies that occurred prior to metlife bank s acquisition  including indemnification for any repurchase claims made from investors who purchased mortgage loans from the sellers 
substantially all mortgage servicing rights msrs that were acquired by metlife bank relate to loans sold to federal national mortgage association fnma or federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc 
metlife bank has originated and sold mortgages primarily to fnma and fhlmc and sold federal housing administration and loans guaranteed by the united states department of veterans affairs in mortgage backed securities guaranteed by government national mortgage association gnma collectively  the agency investors and  to a limited extent  a small number of private investors 
currently of metlife bank s billion servicing portfolio consists of agency investors product 
other than repurchase obligations which are subject to indemnification by sellers of acquired assets as described above  metlife bank s exposure to repurchase obligations and losses related to origination deficiencies is limited to the approximately billion of loans originated by metlife bank all of which have been originated since august

mortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of congressional attention 
authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss mitigation practices 
metlife bank s mortgage servicing has been the subject of recent inquiries and requests by state and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities 
metlife bank is cooperating with the authorities review of this business 
on april   the office of the comptroller of the currency occ entered into consent decrees with several banks  including metlife bank

summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of the company s significant accounting policies see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values  ii investment impairments  iii estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  
table of contents iv amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  v measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  vi liabilities for future policyholder benefits and the accounting for reinsurance  vii measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  viii measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities  and ix liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters 
in addition  the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to aforementioned critical accounting estimates 
in applying the company s accounting policies  we make subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s business and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
estimated fair value of investments in determining the estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities  equity securities  trading and other securities  short term investments  cash equivalents  mortgage loans and msrs  various methodologies  assumptions and inputs are utilized 
when quoted prices in active markets are not available  the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies  giving priority to observable inputs 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or other similar techniques 
the inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated fair values are based on available market information and management s judgments about financial instruments 
the significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
when observable inputs are not available  the market standard valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently  and therefore have little or no price transparency  rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
these unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or estimation  and cannot be supported by reference to market activity 
even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities 
the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale and securitized reverse residential mortgage loans is determined based on observable pricing for securities backed by similar types of loans  adjusted to convert the securities prices to loan prices  or from independent broker quotations  which is intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from third parties 
certain other mortgage loans that were previously designated as held for investment  but now are designated as held for sale  are recorded at the lower 
table of contents of amortized cost or estimated fair value  or for collateral dependent loans  estimated fair value of the collateral less expected disposition costs determined on an individual loan basis 
for these loans  estimated fair value is determined using independent broker quotations  or values provided by independent valuation specialists  or when the loan is in foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is estimated using internal models 
the estimated fair value of msrs is principally determined through the use of internal discounted cash flow models which utilize various assumptions 
valuation inputs and assumptions include generally observable items such as type and age of loan  loan interest rates  current market interest rates  and certain unobservable inputs  including assumptions regarding estimates of discount rates  loan prepayments and servicing costs  all of which are sensitive to changing markets conditions 
the use of different valuation assumptions and inputs  as well as assumptions relating to the collection of expected cash flows  may have a material effect on the estimated fair values of msrs 
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity 
the company s ability to sell securities  or the price ultimately realized for these securities  depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the estimated fair value of investments 
investment impairments one of the significant estimates related to available for sale securities is the evaluation of investments for impairments 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairment includes an analysis of gross unrealized losses by three categories of severity and or age of gross unrealized loss 
an extended and severe unrealized loss position on a fixed maturity security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payments and the company s evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flows or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to its amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flows to be collected 
in contrast  for certain equity securities  greater weight and consideration are given by the company to a decline in estimated fair value and the likelihood such estimated fair value decline will recover 
additionally  we consider a wide range of factors about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the estimated fair value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  
table of contents vi with respect to fixed maturity securities  whether the company has the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before recovery of the decline in estimated fair value below amortized cost  vii with respect to equity securities  whether the company s ability and intent to hold a particular security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its estimated fair value to an amount at least equal to its cost  viii with respect to structured securities  changes in forecasted cash flows after considering the quality of underlying collateral  expected prepayment speeds  current and forecasted loss severity  consideration of the payment terms of the underlying assets backing a particular security  and the payment priority within the tranche structure of the security  and ix other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to investment impairments 
derivative financial instruments the determination of estimated fair value of freestanding derivatives  when quoted market values are not available  is based on market standard valuation methodologies and inputs that management believes are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing the instruments 
derivative valuations can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  default risk  nonperformance risk  volatility  liquidity and changes in estimates and assumptions used in the pricing models 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on significant inputs into the otc derivative pricing models and credit risk adjustment 
the company issues certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits  which are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains losses 
the estimated fair values of these embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees 
the projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
a risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flows from the guarantees are projected under multiple capital market scenarios using observable risk free rates 
the valuation of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for the company s nonperformance risk and risk margins for non capital market inputs 
the nonperformance risk adjustment  which is captured as a spread over the risk free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flows of the liability  is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spreads in the secondary market for metlife  inc s debt  including related credit default swaps 
these observable spreads are then adjusted  as necessary  to reflect the priority of these liabilities and the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiaries compared to metlife  inc risk margins are established to capture the non capital market risks of the instrument which represent the additional compensation a market participant would require to assume the risks related to the uncertainties in certain actuarial assumptions 
the establishment of risk margins requires the use of significant management judgment  including assumptions of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantees 

table of contents as part of its regular review of critical accounting estimates  the company periodically assesses inputs for estimating nonperformance risk in fair value measurements 
during the second quarter of  the company completed a study that aggregated and evaluated data  including historical recovery rates of insurance companies  as well as policyholder behavior observed during the recent financial crisis 
as a result  at the end of the second quarter of  the company refined the manner in which its insurance subsidiaries incorporate expected recovery rates into the nonperformance risk adjustment for purposes of estimating the fair value of investment type contracts and embedded derivatives within insurance contracts 
the refinement impacted the company s income from continuing operations  net of income tax  with no effect on operating earnings 
the table below illustrates the impact that a range of reasonably likely variances in credit spreads would have on the company s consolidated balance sheet  excluding the effect of income tax 
however  these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables  such as equity price levels and market volatility  that can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values 
therefore  the table does not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements under the credit spread variance scenarios presented below 
in determining the ranges  the company has considered current market conditions  as well as the market level of spreads that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term 
the ranges do not reflect extreme market conditions experienced during the recent financial crisis as the company does not consider those to be reasonably likely events in the near future 
carrying value at december  pabs dac and voba in millions increase in the company s credit spread as reported decrease in the company s credit spread the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
if it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company from that previously reported 
assessments of hedge effectiveness and measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets 
market conditions including  but not limited to  changes in interest rates  equity indices  market volatility and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in the company s nonperformance risk  variations in actuarial assumptions regarding policyholder behavior  mortality and risk margins related to non capital market inputs  may result in significant fluctuations in the estimated fair value of the guarantees that could materially affect net income 
if interpretations change  there is a risk that features previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value in the consolidated financial statements and respective changes in estimated fair value could materially affect net income 
additionally  the company ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits described in the preceding paragraphs 
the value of the embedded derivatives on the ceded risk is determined using a methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantees directly written by the company with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the 
table of contents reinsurer 
because certain of the direct guarantees do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and  thus are not accounted for at fair value  significant fluctuations in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without a corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s derivatives and hedging programs 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
costs that vary with and relate to the production of new and renewal insurance business are deferred as dac 
such costs consist principally of commissions  certain agency expenses  policy issuance expenses and certain advertising costs 
voba represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance  annuity  and investment type contracts in force at the acquisition date 
for certain acquired blocks of business  the estimated fair value of the in force contract obligations exceeded the book value of assumed in force insurance policy liabilities  resulting in negative voba  which is presented separately from voba as an additional insurance liability included in other policy related balances 
the estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns  nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
the company will adopt new guidance regarding the accounting for dac beginning in the first quarter of and will apply it retrospectively to all prior periods presented in its consolidated financial statements for all insurance contracts 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period which can result in significant fluctuations in amortization of dac and voba 
the company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
the company monitors these events and only changes the assumption when its long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba amortization of approximately million with an offset to the company s unearned revenue liability of approximately million for this factor 
the company also periodically reviews other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these include investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
assumptions used in the calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed are updated annually 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba are due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on participating traditional life contracts  variable and universal life contracts and annuity contracts 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 

table of contents at december   and  dac and voba for the company was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
amortization of dac and voba associated with the variable and universal life and the annuity contracts was significantly impacted by movements in equity markets 
the following chart illustrates the effect on dac and voba of changing each of the respective assumptions  as well as updating estimated gross margins or profits with actual gross margins or profits during the years ended december   and increases decreases in dac and voba balances  as presented below  resulted in a corresponding decrease increase in amortization 
years ended december  in millions investment return separate account balances net investment gain loss guaranteed minimum income benefits expense in force persistency policyholder dividends and other total the following represents significant items contributing to the changes to dac and voba amortization in the decrease in equity markets during the year lowered separate account balances which led to a reduction in actual and expected future gross profits on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts resulting in an increase of million in dac and voba amortization 
changes in net investment gains losses resulted in the following changes in dac and voba amortization actual gross profits decreased as a result of an increase in liabilities associated with guarantee obligations on variable annuities  resulting in a decrease of dac and voba amortization of million  excluding the impact from the company s nonperformance risk and risk margins  which are described below 
this decrease in actual gross profits was more than offset by freestanding derivative gains associated with the hedging of such guarantee obligations  which resulted in an increase in dac and voba amortization of million 
the widening of the company s nonperformance risk adjustment decreased the valuation of guarantee liabilities  increased actual gross profits and increased dac and voba amortization by million 
this was partially offset by higher risk margins which increased the guarantee liability valuations  decreased actual gross profits and decreased dac and voba amortization by million 
the remainder of the impact of net investment gains losses  which increased dac amortization by million  was primarily attributable to current period investment activities

goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in such instances  the implied fair value of the goodwill is 
table of contents determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition 
the key inputs  judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings  current book value with and without accumulated other comprehensive income  the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business  long term growth rates  comparative market multiples  the account value of in force business  projections of new and renewal business  as well as margins on such business  the level of interest rates  credit spreads  equity market levels  and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit 
the estimated fair values of the retirement products and individual life reporting units are particularly sensitive to the equity market levels 
we apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units 
the valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management s reasonable expectation regarding future developments 
these estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position 
during the third quarter of  the company announced its decision to explore the sale of metlife bank s depository business 
as a result  in september  the company performed a goodwill impairment test on metlife bank  which is a separate reporting unit within corporate other 
as a result of the testing  the company recorded a million goodwill impairment charge that is reflected as a net investment loss for the year ended december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment tests of its other reporting units and concluded that the fair values of all reporting units were in excess of their carrying values and  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate potential triggering events that may affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units to assess whether any goodwill impairment exists 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed interim goodwill impairment testing on the retirement products reporting unit 
this testing was due to adverse market conditions  which caused both the equity markets and interest rates to decline 
the fair value of the retirement products reporting unit  which was calculated based on application of an actuarial valuation approach  exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
the valuation methodology is subject to judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change 
if we had assumed that the discount rate was basis points higher than the discount rate  the fair value of the retirement products reporting unit would have exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
as of december   the amount of goodwill allocated to the retirement products reporting unit was approximately billion 
the estimate of fair value is inherently uncertain and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimate is based  will  in all likelihood  differ in some respects from actual future results 
a change in market conditions  including equity market returns  interest rate levels and market volatility could result in a goodwill impairment 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced that it will be reorganizing its business into three broad geographic regions  the americas  emea and asia  and creating a global employee benefits business  to better reflect its global reach 
as a result  the company s reporting structure may change the composition of certain of its reporting units 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s goodwill 
liability for future policy benefits generally  future policy benefits are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for 
table of contents future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  disability incidence  disability terminations  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumed  additional liabilities may be established  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
future policy benefit liabilities for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance  recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the assumptions of investment performance and volatility for variable products are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index  such as the s p index 
the company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and guarantees  as well as in the establishment of the related liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s liability for future policy benefits 
reinsurance accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance agreements  the company determines whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company reviews all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance agreement does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the agreement using the deposit method of accounting 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s reinsurance programs 
income taxes the company provides for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and 
table of contents transactions 
these tax laws are complex and are subject to differing interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when in the future certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines  based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
factors in management s determination include the performance of the business and its ability to generate capital gains 
significant judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established  as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review and adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon audit 
the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit is recorded in the financial statements 
the company may be required to change its provision for income taxes when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change  or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events  such as changes in tax laws  tax regulations  or interpretations of such laws or regulations  could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s income taxes 
employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of metlife  inc sponsor and or administer pension and other postretirement benefit plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
in consultation with our external consulting actuarial firms  we determine these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical performance of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data  and expected benefit payout streams 
we determine our expected rate of return on plan assets based upon an approach that considers inflation  real return  term premium  credit spreads  equity risk premium and capital appreciation  as well as expenses  expected asset manager performance and the effect of rebalancing for the equity  debt and real estate asset mix applied on a weighted average basis to our pension asset portfolio 
given the amount of plan assets as of december   if we had assumed an expected rate of return for both our pension and other postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively 
this considers only changes in our assumed long term rate of return given the level and mix of 
table of contents invested assets at the beginning of the year  without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed long term rate of return 
we determine our discount rates used to value the pension and postretirement obligations  based upon rates commensurate with current yields on high quality corporate bonds 
given the amount of pension and postretirement obligations as of december   the beginning of the measurement year  if we had assumed a discount rate for both our pension and postretirement benefit plans that was basis points higher or basis points lower than the rates we assumed  the change in our net periodic costs would have been a decrease of million and an increase of million  respectively 
this considers only changes in our assumed discount rates without consideration of possible changes in any of the other assumptions described above that could ultimately accompany any changes in our assumed discount rate 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional assumptions used in measuring liabilities relating to the company s employee benefit plans 
litigation contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis  the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s assessment of litigation contingencies 
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the company s business 
effective january   the company updated its economic capital model to align segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles 
such changes to the company s economic capital model are applied prospectively 
segment net investment income is also credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity  however  changes in allocated equity do not impact the company s consolidated net investment income  operating earnings or income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax

during the year ended december   income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  increased billion to billion primarily driven by a favorable change in net derivative gains losses  partially offset by increased net investment losses  net of related adjustments  principally associated with dac and voba amortization 
also included in income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  are the results of the divested businesses 
in addition  operating earnings increased  reflecting the impact of the acquisition 
we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset liability management alm principles  focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities 
our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount  while optimizing  net of income tax  risk adjusted net investment income and risk adjusted total return 
our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments  with over of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans 
these securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities 
other invested asset classes including  but not limited to  equity securities  other limited partnership interests and real estate and real estate joint ventures  provide additional diversification and opportunity for long term yield enhancement in addition to supporting the cash flow and duration objectives of our investment portfolio 
we also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio to hedge certain risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and equity market levels 
additional considerations for our investment portfolio include current and expected market conditions and expectations for changes within our specific mix of products and business segments 
in addition  the general account investment portfolio includes  within trading and other securities  contractholder directed investments supporting unit linked variable annuity type liabilities  which do not qualify as separate account assets 
the returns on these contractholder directed investments  which can vary significantly period to period  include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase  inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances 
the composition of the investment portfolio of each business segment is tailored to the specific characteristics of its insurance liabilities  causing certain portfolios to be shorter in duration and others to be longer in duration 
accordingly  certain portfolios are more heavily weighted in longer duration  higher yielding fixed maturity securities  or certain sub sectors of fixed maturity securities  than other portfolios 
investments are purchased to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses 
however  net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences  including changes in market factors such as interest rates  foreign currencies  credit spreads and equity markets  counterparty specific factors such as financial performance  credit rating and collateral valuation  and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing 
changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold 
we use freestanding interest rate  equity  credit and currency derivatives to provide economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities  including embedded derivatives within certain of our variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
for those hedges not designated as accounting hedges  changes in market factors can lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains losses without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged even though these are effective economic hedges 
additionally  we issue liabilities and purchase assets that contain embedded derivatives whose changes in estimated fair value are sensitive to changes in market factors and are also recognized in net derivative gains losses 
the favorable change in net derivative gains losses of billion  from losses of million in to gains of billion in  was driven by a favorable change in freestanding derivatives of billion  which 
table of contents was partially offset by an unfavorable change in embedded derivatives of million primarily associated with variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
the billion favorable change in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to the impact of falling long term and mid term interest rates and equity market movements and volatility 
long term and mid term interest rates fell more in than in which had a positive impact of billion on our interest rate derivatives  million of which was attributable to hedges of variable annuity minimum benefit guarantee liabilities that are accounted for as embedded derivatives 
the impact of equity market movements and volatility in compared to had a positive impact of billion on our equity derivatives  which was primarily attributable to hedges of variable annuity minimum benefit guarantee liabilities that are accounted for as embedded derivatives 
certain variable annuity products with minimum benefit guarantees contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains losses 
the fair value of these embedded derivatives also includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk  which is unhedged 
the million unfavorable change in embedded derivatives was primarily attributable to hedged risks relating to changes in market factors of billion and an unfavorable change in other unhedged non market risks of million  partially offset by a favorable change in unhedged risks for changes in the adjustment for nonperformance risk of billion 
the aforementioned billion unfavorable change in embedded derivatives was more than offset by favorable changes on freestanding derivatives that hedge these risks  which are described in the preceding paragraphs 
the increase in net investment losses primarily reflects impairments on greece sovereign debt securities  intent to sell impairments on other sovereign debt securities due to the repositioning of the alico portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding investments  intent to sell impairments related to the divested businesses  and lower net gains on sales of fixed maturity and equity securities 
these losses were partially offset by net gains on the sales of certain real estate investments and reductions in the mortgage valuation allowance reflecting improving real estate market fundamentals 
income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  related to the divested businesses  excluding net investment gains losses and net derivative gains losses  decreased million to a loss of million in compared to a gain of million in included in this loss was a reduction in total revenues of million and an increase in total expenses of million 
as previously mentioned  the divested businesses include certain operations of metlife bank and the caribbean business 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was billion  or of income loss from continuing operations before provision for income tax  compared with billion  or of income loss from continuing operations before provision for income tax  for the company s and effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of certain permanent tax differences  including non taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing  in relation to income loss from continuing operations before provision for income tax  as well as certain foreign permanent tax differences 
as more fully described in the discussion of performance measures above  we use operating earnings  which does not equate to income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  as determined in accordance with gaap  to analyze our performance  evaluate segment performance  and allocate resources 
we believe that the presentation of operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders  as we measure it for management purposes  enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business 
operating earnings and operating earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for gaap income loss from continuing operations  net of income tax  and gaap net income loss available to metlife  inc s common shareholders  respectively

the increase in operating earnings reflects the impact of the acquisition with the corresponding effects on each of our financial statement lines in both japan and other international regions 
further trends and matters impacting our business and the comparison to results are discussed below 
positive results from strong sales in were offset by losses from severe weather and the impact of the low interest rate environment 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a slightly positive impact on results compared to in  we benefited from strong sales as well as growth and higher persistency in our business  across many of our products 
as a result  we experienced growth in our investment portfolio  as well as our average separate account assets  generating both higher net investment income of million and higher policy fee income of million 
since many of our products are interest spread based  the growth in our individual life  long term care ltc and structured settlement businesses also resulted in a million increase in interest credited expenses 
these increased sales also generated an increase in commission and other volume related expenses of million  which was largely offset by an increase of million in related dac capitalization 
in addition  other non variable expenses increased million due to growth in our existing businesses 
on an annual basis  we perform experience studies  as well as update our assumptions regarding both expected policyholder behaviors and the related investment environment 
these updates  commonly known as unlocking events  result in changes to certain insurance related liabilities  dac and revenue amortization 
the impact of updates to our assumptions in both and  resulted in a net increase to operating earnings of million  in the current year 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced a reduction in our dividend scale related to our closed block 
the impact of this action increased operating earnings by million 

table of contents severe weather during was the primary driver of our unfavorable claims experience in auto home  which decreased operating earnings by million 
in addition  in the third quarter of  we incurred a million charge to increase reserves in connection with our use of the death master file  impacting primarily insurance products 
these events overshadowed favorable claims experience in our dental and disability businesses and strong mortality gains in our group life business  which  combined  improved operating earnings by million 
market factors  specifically the current low interest rate environment  continued to be a challenge during also in  equity markets remained relatively flat compared to much stronger equity market performance 
investment yields were negatively impacted by the current low interest rate environment and lower returns in the equity markets  partially offset by improving real estate markets  resulting in a million decrease in net investment income 
dac  voba and dsi amortization and certain insurance related liabilities are sensitive to market fluctuations  which was the primary driver of higher expenses of million in these categories 
in particular  the less favorable investment markets caused acceleration of dac amortization 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million improvement in operating earnings  primarily driven by lower average crediting rates on our annuity and funding agreement businesses 
the lower average crediting rates continue to reflect the lower investment returns available in the marketplace 
also contributing to the decrease in interest credited is the impact from derivatives that are used to hedge certain liabilities in our funding agreement business 
in addition  growth in our separate accounts due to favorable equity market performance in and stable equity markets in resulted in increased fees and other revenues of million 
interest expense on debt increased million primarily as a result of debt issued in the third and fourth quarters of in connection with the acquisition and federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
the company incurred million of expenses related to a liquidation plan filed by the department of financial services for elny in the third quarter of results from our mortgage loan servicing business were lower driven by an increase in expenses of million in response to both a larger portfolio and increased regulatory oversight 
the company also benefited from a higher tax benefit in of million over primarily due to million of charges in related to the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of together  the health care act 
the health care act reduced the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs to the extent of any medicare part d subsidy received beginning in because the deductibility of future retiree health care costs was reflected in our financial statements  the entire future impact of this change in law was required to be recorded as a charge in the first quarter of  when the legislation was enacted 
the higher tax benefit was also a result of higher utilization of tax preferenced investments which provide tax credits and deductions

strong underwriting results generated about half of our increase in operating earnings 
the remaining increase resulted from the impact of annual assumption updates  lower policyholder dividends and higher fees from our variable and universal life business 
these increases were dampened by the negative impacts of the sustained low interest rate environment 
growth in our open block traditional life and in our variable and universal life businesses was more than offset by declines in our group life and non medical health businesses  as well as the expected run off from our closed block business 
sustained high levels of unemployment and a challenging pricing environment continue to depress growth in many of our group insurance businesses 
our dental business benefited from higher enrollment and certain pricing actions  but this was more than offset by a decline in revenues from our disability business 
this reduction was mainly due to net customer cancellations and lower covered lives 
our ltc revenues were flat period over period  consistent with the discontinuance of the sale of this coverage at the end of although revenues have declined from the prior year  current year premiums and deposits  along with an expansion of our securities lending program  resulted in an increase in our average invested assets  which contributed million to operating earnings 
mirroring the growth in average invested assets in our individual life and ltc businesses  interest credited on long duration contracts and on our policyholder account balances increased by million 
the aforementioned increased sales of our individual variable and universal life products  which was mainly driven by our launch of a new product in the current year  coupled with ongoing organic growth in the business  increased operating earnings by million 
these increased sales also generated an increase in commission expenses  which was mostly offset by the capitalization of these expenses 
broker dealer related revenues also increased during the year and were significantly offset by a corresponding increase in other expenses 
in  pricing actions and improved claims experience  mainly as a result of stabilizing benefits utilization  drove a million increase in our dental results 
higher closures and lower incidences in contributed to the million increase in our disability results 
our life businesses were essentially flat  however  lower claims incidence resulted in very strong group life mortality gains  which were offset by increased severity of claims in the variable and universal life businesses 
on an annual basis  we perform experience studies  as well as update 
table of contents our assumptions surrounding both expected policyholder behaviors and the related investment environment 
these updates  commonly known as unlocking events  result in changes to certain insurance related liabilities  dac and revenue amortization 
the impact of updates to our assumptions  in both and primarily related to policyholder behaviors  such as projected premium assumptions and various factors impacting persistency  coupled with insurance related refinements  resulted in a net increase to operating earnings of million 
partially offsetting these favorable impacts was a million charge  recorded in the third quarter of the current year  related to our use of the death master file  in both our group and individual life businesses 
refinements in our dac model in both years as well as the impact of higher amortization in contributed to a million net decrease in amortization 
the higher level of amortization in was primarily due to the emergence of actual premium and lapse information which differed from management s expectations 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced a reduction to our dividend scale related to our closed block 
the impact of this action increased operating earnings by million 
market factors  specifically the current low interest rate environment  continued to be a challenge during investment yields were negatively impacted by lower returns on allocated equity and lower returns in the equity markets  partially offset by improving real estate markets 
unlike in retirement products and corporate benefit funding  a reduction in investment yield does not necessarily drive a corresponding change in the rates credited on policyholder account balances or amounts held for future policyholder benefits 
the reduction in investment yield resulted in a million decrease in operating earnings 
partially offsetting this decline was the impact of updating projected market factors as part of our aforementioned annual update to assumptions 
this update resulted in an unlocking event  resulting in a million increase to operating earnings

total annuity sales increased to billion due to strong growth in variable annuities across all distribution channels 
variable annuity product sales increased primarily due to the introduction of a new higher benefit  lower risk variable annuity rider and changes in competitors offerings which  we believe  made our products more attractive 
we have launched several changes to the products and riders we offer that we expect will reduce sales volumes in  as we manage these sales volumes to strike the right balance among growth  profitability and risk 
total annuity net flows were billion  higher than in changes in interest rates 
table of contents and equity markets can significantly impact our earnings 
in  interest rates declined while equity markets remained relatively flat compared to much stronger equity market performance 
operating earnings were down mainly due to these market factors 
strong sales and higher persistency in  along with the impact of an increase in allocated equity  increased operating earnings by million 
the strong sales of variable annuities increased our average separate account assets and  as a result  we generated higher asset based fee revenue on the separate account assets and higher net investment income  partially offset by increases in dac amortization 
partially offsetting these favorable impacts was an increase in variable expenses  primarily related to new business commissions and asset based commissions of million  net of related dac capitalization 
other non variable expenses also increased million due to growth in the business 
investment market performance reduced our operating earnings by million 
dac  voba and dsi amortization  as well as certain insurance related liabilities  are sensitive to market fluctuations  which was the primary driver of higher expenses in these categories 
in particular  the less favorable equity markets when compared to caused an acceleration of dac amortization 
lower investment returns on certain limited partnerships and lower returns on allocated equity also contributed to the decline in operating earnings 
partially offsetting these decreases was an improvement in operating earnings  primarily driven by lower average crediting rates on annuity fixed rate funds 
lower average crediting rates continue to reflect the lower investment returns available in the marketplace 
growth in our separate accounts  due to favorable equity market performance in and  resulted in increased fees and other revenues 
to better align with hedged risks  certain elements of our variable annuity hedging program that were previously recorded in net investment income were recorded in net derivative gains losses beginning in which resulted in a decrease in operating earnings of million 
lower income annuity mortality gains of million also reduced operating earnings in we review and update our long term assumptions used in our calculations of certain insurance related liabilities and dac annually  which may result in changes and are recorded in the fourth quarter each year 
this annual update of assumptions  other insurance liability refinements and dac model revisions made during the year  contributed to a net operating earnings reduction of million

corporate benefit funding had strong pension closeout sales in the uk  and strong sales of structured settlements 
although the combination of poor equity returns and the low interest rate environment has resulted in underfunded pension plans  which reduces our customers flexibility to engage in transactions such as pension closeouts  sales in the uk remained strong as we continue to penetrate that market 
sales in our structured settlement business were strong as we remain very competitive in the marketplace 
premiums for these businesses were almost entirely offset by the related change in policyholder benefits 
however  current year premiums  deposits  funding agreement issuances  increased allocated equity  and the expansion of our securities lending program  all contributed to the growth of our average invested assets  which led to an increase in net investment income of million 
deposits into separate accounts  including guaranteed interest contracts  and corporate owned life insurance  increased significantly resulting in a million increase in advisory fees and an million increase in premium tax 
however  these expenses are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
market factors  including the current low interest rate environment  have negatively impacted our investment returns by million 
these lower investment returns include the impact of returns on invested economic capital 
the low interest rate environment was also the primary driver of the decrease in interest credited to policyholders of million 
many of our funding agreement and guaranteed interest contract liabilities are tied to market indices 
interest rates on new business were set lower  as were the rates on existing business with terms that can fluctuate 
also contributing to the decrease in interest credited is the impact from derivatives that are used to hedge certain liabilities in our funding agreement business 
commensurate with our strong sales of structured settlements  the interest credited expense associated with these insurance liabilities increased million 
the company s use of the death master file in connection with our post retirement benefit business resulted in a charge in the third quarter of the current year of million

in  operating results were negatively impacted by severe weather including record numbers of tornadoes in the second quarter and hurricane irene in the third quarter 
policy sales decreased as the housing and new 
table of contents automobile sales markets remained sluggish  resulting in a decrease in exposures 
however  average premium per policy increased for both our homeowners and auto policies  more than offsetting the negative impact from the decrease in exposures 
adverse claims experience was the primary driver of the decrease in operating earnings 
catastrophe related losses increased million compared to mainly due to severe storm activity in the us during the second and third quarters of  which resulted in million of losses 
the second quarter included catastrophe related losses mainly due to a record number of tornadoes for a one month period that resulted in damage in many states 
the third quarter included catastrophe related losses resulting from the impact from hurricane irene 
in addition  current year non catastrophe claim costs increased million as a result of higher claim frequencies in both our auto and homeowners businesses due primarily to more severe winter weather in the first quarter of and to non catastrophe wind and hail through the remainder of the year 
the negative impact of these items was partially offset by additional favorable development of prior year losses of million 
the increase in average premium per policy in both our homeowners and auto businesses improved operating earnings by million and the decrease in exposures resulted in a million decrease in operating earnings as the negative impact from lower premiums exceeded the positive impact from lower claims 
exposures are primarily each automobile for the auto line of business and each residence for the homeowners line of business 
the impact of the items discussed above can be seen in the unfavorable change in the combined ratio  including catastrophes  to in from in the combined ratio  excluding catastrophes  was in compared to in higher commissions  resulting from the increase in average premium per policy  coupled with an increase in other volume related expenses contributed to the decrease in operating earnings

the billion favorable variance in freestanding derivatives was primarily attributable to market factors  including falling long term and mid term interest rates  a stronger recovery in equity markets in the prior year than the current year  a greater decrease in equity volatility in the prior year as compared to the current year  a strengthening us dollar and widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services sector 
falling long term and mid term interest rates in the current year compared to rising long term and mid term interest rates in the prior year had a positive impact of billion on our interest rate derivatives  million of which is attributable to hedges of variable annuity minimum benefit guarantee liabilities  which are accounted for as embedded derivatives 
in addition  stronger equity market recovery and lower equity market volatility in the prior year as compared to the current year had a positive impact of billion on our equity derivatives  which we use to hedge variable annuity minimum benefit guarantees 
us dollar strengthening had a positive impact of million on certain of our foreign currency derivatives  which are used to hedge foreign denominated asset and liability exposures 
finally  widening corporate credit spreads in the financial services sector had a positive impact of million on our purchased protection credit derivatives 
certain variable annuity products with minimum benefit guarantees contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gains losses 
these embedded derivatives also include an adjustment for nonperformance risk of the related liabilities carried at estimated fair value 
the billion unfavorable change in embedded derivatives was primarily attributable to the impact of market factors  including falling long term and mid term interest rates  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  equity volatility and equity market movements 
falling long term and mid term interest rates in the current year compared to rising long term and mid term interest rates in the prior year had a negative impact of billion 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact of million 
equity volatility decreased more in the prior year than in the current year causing a negative impact of million  and a stronger recovery in the equity markets in the prior year than in the current year had a negative impact of million 
the unfavorable impact from these hedged risks was partially offset by a favorable change related to the adjustment for nonperformance risk of billion  from losses of billion in to losses of million in this million loss was net of a million loss related to a refinement in estimating the spreads used in the adjustment for nonperformance risk made in the second quarter of gains on the freestanding derivatives that hedged these embedded derivative risks largely offset the change in liabilities attributable to market factors  excluding the adjustment for nonperformance risk  which does not have an economic impact on the company 

table of contents improved or stabilizing market conditions across several invested asset classes and sectors as compared to the prior year resulted in decreases in impairments and in net realized losses from sales and disposals of investments in most components of our investment portfolio 
these decreases  coupled with a decrease in the provision for credit losses on mortgage loans due to improved market conditions  resulted in a billion improvement in net investment gains losses

the company s and effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of certain permanent tax differences  including non taxable investment income and tax credits for investments in low income housing  in relation to income loss from continuing operations before income tax  as well as certain foreign permanent tax differences 
as more fully described in the discussion of performance measures above  we use operating earnings  which does not equate to income loss from continuing operations as determined in accordance with gaap  to analyze our performance  evaluate segment performance  and allocate resources 
operating earnings is also a measure by which senior management s and many other employees performance is evaluated for the purpose of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans 
we believe that the presentation of operating earnings  as we measure it for management purposes  enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business

the improvement in the financial markets was the primary driver of the increase in operating earnings as evidenced by higher net investment income and an increase in average separate account balances  which resulted in an increase in policy fee income 
partially offsetting this improvement was an increase in amortization of dac  voba and dsi 
the increase in operating earnings also includes the positive impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in this improved reported operating earnings by million for compared to furthermore  the period also includes one month of alico results  contributing million to the increase in operating earnings 
the current period also benefited from the dividend scale reduction in the fourth quarter of the improvement in results compared to was partially offset by the prior period impact of pesification in argentina and unfavorable claims experience 
net investment income increased from higher yields and growth in average invested assets 
yields were positively impacted by the effects of stabilizing real estate markets and recovering private equity markets year over year on real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests  and by the effects of continued repositioning of the accumulated liquidity in our portfolio to longer duration and higher yielding investments  including investment grade corporate fixed maturity securities 
growth in our investment portfolio was primarily due to the acquisition and positive net cash flows from growth in our domestic individual and group life businesses  as well as certain international businesses  higher cash collateral balances received from our derivative counterparties  as well as the temporary investment of proceeds from the debt and common stock issuances in anticipation of the acquisition 
with the exception of the cash flows from such securities issuances  which were temporarily invested in lower yielding liquid investments  we continued to reposition the accumulated liquidity in our portfolio to longer duration and higher yielding investments 
since many of our products are interest spread based  higher net investment income is typically offset by higher interest credited expense 
however  interest credited expense  including amounts reflected in policyholder 
table of contents benefits and claims  decreased primarily in our domestic funding agreement business  which experienced lower average crediting rates combined with lower average account balances 
our fixed annuities business also experienced lower crediting rates 
certain crediting rates can move consistently with the underlying market indices  primarily the london inter bank offer rate libor  which were lower than the prior year 
the impact from the growth in our structured settlement  ltc and disability businesses partially offset those decreases in interest credited expense 
a significant increase in average separate account balances is largely attributable to favorable market performance resulting from improved market conditions since the second quarter of and positive net cash flows from the annuity business 
this resulted in higher policy fees and other revenues of million  most notably in our retirement products segment 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased policy fees by million 
the improvement in fees is partially offset by greater dac  voba and dsi amortization of million 
policy fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in the separate accounts 
dac  voba and dsi amortization is based on the earnings of the business  which in the retirement business are derived  in part  from fees earned on separate account balances 
a portion of the increase in amortization was due to the impact of higher current year gross margins  a primary component in the determination of the amount of amortization for our insurance products segment  mostly in the closed block resulting from increased investment yields and the impact of dividend scale reductions 
the reduction in the dividend scale in the fourth quarter of resulted in a million decrease in policyholder dividends in the traditional life business in the current period 
claims experience varied amongst our businesses with a net unfavorable impact of million to operating earnings compared to the prior year 
we had unfavorable claims experience in our auto home segment  primarily due to increased catastrophes 
our insurance products segment experienced mixed claims experience with a net unfavorable impact 
we experienced less favorable mortality experience in our corporate benefit funding segment despite favorable experience in our structured settlements business 
interest expense increased million primarily as a result of the full year impact of debt issuances in and of senior notes and debt securities issued in anticipation of the acquisition  partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on variable rate collateral financing arrangements 
in addition to a million increase associated with the acquisition  operating expenses increased due to the impact of a million benefit recorded in the prior period related to the pesification in argentina  as well as a million increase related to the investment and growth in our international businesses 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates also increased other expenses by million 
in addition  the current period includes a million increase in charitable contributions and million of costs associated with the integration of alico 
offsetting these increases was a million reduction in discretionary spending  such as consulting  rent and postemployment related costs 
in addition  we experienced a million decline in market driven expenses  primarily pension and post retirement benefit costs 
also contributing to the decrease was a million reduction in real estate related charges and million of lower legal costs

changes to the provision for income taxes in both periods contributed to an increase in operating earnings of million for our other international regions segment  resulting from a million unfavorable impact in due to a change in assumption regarding the repatriation of earnings and a benefit of million in the current year from additional permanent reinvestment of earnings  the reversal of tax provisions and favorable changes in liabilities for tax uncertainties

in addition  we experienced overall modest revenue growth in several of our businesses despite this challenging environment 
high levels of unemployment continue to depress growth across most of our group insurance businesses due to lower covered payrolls 
growth in our group life business was dampened by a decline in our non medical health and individual life businesses 
however  our dental business benefited from higher enrollment and pricing actions  partially offset by lower persistency and the loss of existing subscribers  driven by high unemployment 
this business also experienced more stable utilization and benefits costs in the current year 
the revenue growth from our dental business was more than offset by a decline in revenues from our disability business  mainly due to net customer cancellations  changes in benefit levels and lower covered lives 
our long term care revenues were flat year over year  concurrent with the discontinuance of the sale of this coverage at the end of in our individual life business  the change in revenues was suppressed by the impact of a benefit recorded in the prior year related to the positive resolution of certain legal matters

the significant components of the million increase in operating earnings were an improvement in net investment income and the impact of a reduction in dividends to certain policyholders  coupled with lower expenses 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in dac amortization  as well as net unfavorable claims experience across several of our businesses 
higher net investment income of million was due to a million increase from growth in average invested assets and a million increase from higher yields

inflation also increases expenses for labor and other materials  potentially putting pressure on profitability if such costs cannot be passed through in our product prices 
inflation could also lead to increased costs for losses and loss adjustment expenses in certain of our businesses  which could require us to adjust our pricing to reflect our expectations for future inflation 
prolonged and elevated inflation could adversely affect the financial markets and the economy generally  and dispelling it may require governments to pursue a restrictive fiscal and monetary policy  which could constrain overall economic activity  inhibit revenue growth and reduce the number of attractive investment opportunities 
investments investment risks the company s primary investment objective is to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the company is exposed to four primary sources of investment risk credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  interest rate risk  relating to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in market interest rates  liquidity risk  relating to the diminished ability to sell certain investments in times of strained market conditions  and market valuation risk  relating to the variability in the estimated fair value of investments associated with changes in market factors such as credit spreads 
the company manages risk through in house fundamental analysis of the underlying obligors  issuers  transaction structures and real estate properties 
the company also manages credit risk  market valuation risk and liquidity risk through industry and issuer diversification and asset allocation 
for real estate and agricultural assets  the company manages credit risk and market valuation risk through geographic  property type and product type diversification and asset allocation 
the company manages interest rate risk as part of its asset and liability management strategies  through product design  such as the use of market value adjustment features and surrender charges  and through proactive monitoring and management of certain non guaranteed elements of its products  such as the resetting of credited interest and dividend rates for policies that permit such adjustments 
the company also uses certain derivative instruments in the management of credit  interest rate  currency and equity market risks 
purchased credit default swaps are utilized by the company to mitigate credit risk in its investment portfolio 
generally  the company purchases credit protection by entering into credit default swaps referencing the issuers of specific assets owned by the company 
in certain cases  basis risk exists between these credit default swaps 
table of contents and the specific assets owned by the company 
for example  the company may purchase credit protection on a macro basis to reduce exposure to specific industries or other portfolio concentrations 
in such instances  the referenced entities and obligations under the credit default swaps may not be identical to the individual obligors or securities in the company s investment portfolio 
in addition  the company s purchased credit default swaps may have shorter tenors than the underlying investments they are hedging 
however  the company dynamically hedges this risk through the rebalancing and rollover of its credit default swaps at their most liquid tenors 
the company believes that its purchased credit default swaps serve as effective legal and economic hedges of its credit exposure 
the company generally enters into market standard purchased and written credit default swap contracts 
payout under such contracts is triggered by certain credit events experienced by the referenced entities 
for credit default swaps covering north american corporate issuers  credit events typically include bankruptcy and failure to pay on borrowed money 
for european corporate issuers  credit events typically also include involuntary restructuring 
with respect to credit default contracts on western european sovereign debt  credit events typically include failure to pay debt obligations  repudiation  moratorium  or involuntary restructuring 
in each case  payout on a credit default swap is triggered only after the credit derivatives determinations committee of the international swaps and derivatives association deems that a credit event has occurred 
current environment the global economy and markets are still affected by a period of significant stress that began in the second half of this disruption adversely affected the financial services sector in particular and global capital markets 
the federal reserve board has taken a number of actions in recent years to spur economic activity by keeping interest rates low and may take further actions to influence interest rates in the future  which may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk bearing investments 
see risk factors governmental and regulatory actions for the purpose of stabilizing and revitalizing the financial markets and protecting investors and consumers may not achieve the intended effect or could adversely affect our competitive position 
beginning in and continuing throughout  concerns increased about capital markets and the solvency of certain european union member states  including portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain  and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to their sovereign debt 
this  in turn  increased market volatility that will continue to affect the performance of various asset classes in  and perhaps longer  until there is an ultimate resolution of these european union sovereign debt related concerns 
as a result of concerns about the ability of portugal  ireland  italy  greece and spain  commonly referred to as europe s perimeter region  to service their sovereign debt  these countries have experienced credit ratings downgrades  including the downgrade of greece s sovereign debt in july by moody s investors service  inc moody s and s p to ca and cc ratings  respectively rating designations of likely in  or very near  default  following the announcement of the debt exchange proposal summarized below 
in february  s p further downgraded greece  as described below 
despite support programs for europe s perimeter region  concerns about the ability to service sovereign debt subsequently expanded to other european union member states 
as a result  in late and early  several other european union member states have experienced credit ratings downgrades or have had their credit ratings outlook changed to negative 
as summarized below  at december   the company did not have significant exposure to the sovereign debt of europe s perimeter region 
accordingly  we do not expect such investments to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
outside of europe s perimeter region  the company s sovereign debt  corporate debt and perpetual hybrid securities in europe were concentrated in the united kingdom  germany  france  the netherlands and poland  which are higher rated countries within the european union  as well in switzerland and norway  which are two higher rated non european union countries 
greece support program 
in july  a public sector support program for greece of billion was announced  as well as a separate  voluntary debt exchange proposal for private sector holders of greece sovereign debt known as private sector involvement  or psi 
private investors that voluntarily participate in the initially proposed july psi proposal  which was expected to apply to greece s sovereign debt maturing 
table of contents through  were expected to incur losses on a net present value basis of approximately on such securities 
in october  a revision of the july psi proposal was announced which included a voluntary nominal discount on all maturities of greece sovereign debt held by the private sector 
in addition to this  the public sector greece financing package was revised to billion plus a contribution of billion from greece s public sector creditors to provide collateral enhancements on the exchanged greece sovereign bonds under the october psi proposal 
on february   the euro group  which is comprised of the finance ministers of the member states of the european union  representatives of the european commission and the european central bank  announced a billion support program that contains a psi proposal for a voluntary nominal discount on all maturities of greece sovereign debt held by the private sector 
on february   greece s parliament retroactively inserted collective action clauses in the documentation of certain series of its sovereign debt  which has the effect of binding all private sector investors to accept the terms of a debt exchange  if a quorum of private sector investors accepts the debt exchange proposal 
greece launched a sovereign debt exchange offer on february  on february   as a result of the retroactive insertion of such collective action clauses  s p downgraded greece s credit rating to sd  a rating of selective default 
if the greece sovereign debt exchange offer is consummated  s p has stated it will likely consider the selective default to have been cured and would likely raise the sovereign credit rating on greece 
europe s perimeter region sovereign debt securities 
our holdings of greece sovereign debt were acquired in the acquisition and our amortized cost basis reflects recording such securities at estimated fair value on november   which was substantially below par  partially mitigating our impairment exposure 
during the year ended december   we recorded non cash impairment charges of million on our holdings of greece s sovereign debt 
in addition  during the year ended december   we sold a significant portion of our europe s perimeter region sovereign debt  thereby substantially reducing our exposure

the company has investments across certain european union member states and other countries in the region that are not members of the european union collectively  the european region 
in the european region  we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher rated countries  reducing our holdings through sales of financial services securities during and and sales of europe s perimeter region sovereign debt in  and by purchasing certain single name credit default protection in and our sales of financial services securities were focused on institutions with exposure to europe s perimeter region  lower preference capital structure instruments  and larger positions

fitch affirmed its aaa rating on us treasury securities and kept its outlook stable 
in october  moody s affirmed its august ratings but revised its negative outlook to stable 
in november  fitch affirmed its aaa rating on us treasury securities but changed its us credit rating outlook to negative from stable  citing the failure of a special congressional committee to agree on certain deficit reduction measures 
we continue to closely evaluate the implications on our investment portfolio of further rating agency downgrades of us treasury securities and believe our investment portfolio is well positioned 
in light of the related market uncertainty  we increased our liquidity position in july with the raising of the statutory debt ceiling in august  we have subsequently redeployed and reduced some of 
table of contents this increased liquidity position into higher yielding investments according to our alm discipline 
despite the downgrade by s p  yields on us treasury securities have decreased since these actions  causing an increase in the unrealized gain position on our holdings of us treasury and agency securities 
the s p downgrade initially had an adverse effect on financial markets but the extent of the longer term impact cannot be predicted

valuation of securities 
we are responsible for the determination of estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of publicly traded securities is determined by management after considering one of three primary sources of information quoted market prices in active markets  independent pricing services  or independent broker quotations  whereas for privately placed securities  estimated fair value is determined after considering one of three primary sources of information market standard internal matrix pricing  market standard internal discounted cash flow techniques  or independent pricing services after we determine their use of available observable market data 
discounted cash flow techniques rely upon the estimated future cash flows of the security  credit spreads of comparable public securities and secondary transactions  as well as other factors  including the credit quality of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with privately placed debt securities 
for publicly traded securities  the number of quotations obtained varies by instrument and depends on the liquidity of the particular instrument 
generally  we obtain prices from multiple pricing services to cover all asset classes and obtain multiple prices for certain securities  but ultimately utilize the price with the highest placement in the fair value hierarchy 
independent pricing services that value these instruments use market standard valuation methodologies based on data about market transactions and inputs from multiple pricing sources that are market observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
see note 
table of contents of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the types of market standard valuation methodologies utilized and key assumptions and observable inputs used in applying these standard valuation methodologies 
when a price is not available in the active market or through an independent pricing service  management will value the security primarily using market standard internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques  and non binding quotations from independent brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities 
independent non binding broker quotations utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data 
as shown in the following section  less than of our fixed maturity securities were valued using non binding quotations from independent brokers at december  senior management  independent of the trading and investing functions  is responsible for the oversight of control systems and valuation policies  including reviewing and approving new transaction types and markets  for ensuring that observable market prices and market based parameters are used for valuation  wherever possible  and for determining that judgmental valuation adjustments  when applied  are based upon established policies and are applied consistently over time 
we review our valuation methodologies on an ongoing basis and revise when necessary based on changing market conditions 
we gain assurance on the overall reasonableness and consistent application of input assumptions  valuation methodologies and compliance with accounting standards for fair value determination through our controls designed to ensure that the financial assets and financial liabilities are appropriately valued and represent an exit price 
we utilize several controls  including certain monthly controls  which include  but are not limited to  analysis of portfolio returns to corresponding benchmark returns  comparing a sample of executed prices of securities sold to the fair value estimates  comparing fair value estimates to management s knowledge of the current market  reviewing the bid ask spreads to assess activity  comparing prices from multiple pricing sources  when available  reviewing independent auditor reports regarding the controls over valuation of securities employed by independent pricing services  and ongoing due diligence to confirm that independent pricing services use market based parameters for valuation 
we determine the observability of inputs used in estimated fair values received from independent pricing services or brokers by assessing whether these inputs can be corroborated by observable market data 
the company also applies a formal process to challenge any prices received from independent pricing services that are not considered representative of estimated fair value 
if we conclude that prices received from independent pricing services are not reflective of market activity or representative of estimated fair value  we will seek independent non binding broker quotes or use an internally developed valuation to override these prices 
as described below  such overrides have not been material 
our internally developed valuations of current estimated fair value  which reflect our estimates of liquidity and non performance risks  compared with pricing received from the independent pricing services  did not produce material differences for the vast majority of our fixed maturity securities portfolio 
this is  in part  because our internal estimates of liquidity and non performance risks are generally based on available market evidence and estimates used by other market participants 
in the absence of such market based evidence  management s best estimate is used 
as a result  we generally use the price provided by the independent pricing service under our normal pricing protocol 
the company has reviewed the significance and observability of inputs used in the valuation methodologies to determine the appropriate fair value hierarchy level for each of its securities 
based on the results of this review and investment class analyses  each instrument is categorized as level  or based on the lowest level significant input to its valuation 
certain securities have been classified into level because of unadjusted quoted prices and high volumes of trading activity and narrow bid ask spreads 
most securities valued by independent pricing services have been classified into level because the significant inputs used in pricing these securities are market observable or can be corroborated using market observable information 
most investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities and certain below investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities priced by independent pricing services that use observable inputs have been classified within level distressed privately placed fixed maturity securities have been classified within level below investment grade privately placed fixed maturity securities and less liquid securities with very limited trading activity where estimated fair values are determined by independent pricing services or by non binding quotations from independent brokers that use inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market data  are 
table of contents classified as level use of independent non binding broker quotations generally indicates there is a lack of liquidity or the general lack of transparency in the process to develop these price estimates causing them to be considered level see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs by level within the three level fair value hierarchy by major classes of invested assets 
quarterly  we evaluate and monitor the markets in which our fixed maturity and equity securities trade and  in our judgment  despite reduced levels of liquidity discussed above  believe none of these fixed maturity and equity securities trading markets should be characterized as distressed and disorderly 
fair value hierarchy and level rollforward fixed maturity and equity securities

level fixed maturity securities are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies  independent pricing services and independent non binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
level fixed maturity securities consist of less liquid fixed maturity securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies including alternative residential mortgage loan alt a and sub prime rmbs and less liquid prime rmbs  certain below investment grade private placements and less liquid investment grade corporate securities included in us and foreign corporate securities  less liquid foreign government securities and less liquid abs 
during the year ended december   level fixed maturity securities decreased by billion  or 
the decrease was driven by net transfers out of level  partially offset by net purchases in excess of sales and increase in estimated fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
see analysis of transfers into and or out of level below 
the increase in net purchases in excess of sales of fixed maturity securities were concentrated in abs and foreign government securities  and the increase in estimated fair value recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for fixed maturity securities was concentrated in us corporate securities due in part to a decrease in interest rates 

table of contents a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity securities and equity securities available for sale measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable level inputs is as follows year ended december  fixed maturity securities equity securities in millions balance  beginning of period total realized unrealized gains losses included in earnings other comprehensive income loss purchases sales transfers into level transfers out of level balance  end of period total gains and losses in earnings and other comprehensive income loss are calculated assuming transfers into or out of level occurred at the beginning of the period 
items transferred into and out for the same period are excluded from the rollforward 
total gains losses for fixed maturity securities included in earnings of million and other comprehensive income loss of million  were incurred on these securities subsequent to their transfer into level  for the year ended december   respectively 
an analysis of transfers into and or out of level for the year ended december  is as follows overall  transfers into and or out of level are attributable to a change in the observability of inputs 
assets and liabilities are transferred into level when a significant input cannot be corroborated with market observable data 
this occurs when market activity decreases significantly and underlying inputs cannot be observed  current prices are not available  and when there are significant variances in quoted prices  thereby affecting transparency 
assets and liabilities are transferred out of level when circumstances change such that a significant input can be corroborated with market observable data 
this may be due to a significant increase in market activity  a specific event  or one or more significant input s becoming observable 
transfers into and or out of any level are assumed to occur at the beginning of the period 
significant transfers into and or out of level assets and liabilities for the year ended december  are summarized below during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers into level of million resulted primarily from current market conditions characterized by a lack of trading activity  decreased liquidity and credit ratings downgrades eg  from investment grade to below investment grade 
these current market conditions have resulted in decreased transparency of valuations and an increased use of broker quotations and unobservable inputs to determine estimated fair value principally for certain us and foreign corporate securities and foreign government securities 
during the year ended december   fixed maturity securities transfers out of level of billion resulted primarily from increased transparency of both new issuances that  subsequent to issuance and establishment of trading activity  became priced by independent pricing services and existing issuances that  over time  the company was able to obtain pricing from  or corroborate pricing received from independent pricing services with observable inputs  or there were increases in market activity and upgraded credit ratings primarily for abs  foreign government securities  us and foreign corporate securities and rmbs

the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners naic evaluates the fixed maturity security investments of insurers for regulatory reporting and capital assessment purposes and assigns securities to one of six credit quality categories called naic designations 
if no rating is available from the naic  then as permitted by the naic  an internally developed rating is used 
the naic ratings are generally similar to the credit quality designations of the nationally recognized statistical ratings organizations nrsros for marketable fixed maturity securities  called rating agency designations  except for certain structured securities as described below 
naic ratings and include fixed maturity securities generally considered investment grade ie  rated baa or better by moody s or rated bbb or better by s p and fitch by such rating organizations 
naic ratings through include fixed maturity securities generally considered below investment grade ie  rated ba or lower by moody s or rated bb or lower by s p and fitch by such rating organizations 
rating agency designations are based on availability of applicable ratings from rating agencies on the naic acceptable rating organizations list  including moody s  s p  fitch and realpoint  llc 
if no rating is available from a rating agency  then an internally developed rating is used 
the naic adopted revised rating methodologies for certain structured securities comprised of non agency rmbs  cmbs and abs 
the naic s objective with the revised rating methodologies for these structured securities was to increase the accuracy in assessing expected losses  and to use the improved assessment to determine a more appropriate capital requirement for such structured securities 
the revised methodologies reduce regulatory reliance on rating agencies and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumptions used to estimate expected losses from structured securities 
the company applies the revised naic rating methodologies to structured securities held by metlife  inc s insurance subsidiaries that file naic statutory financial statements 
the naic s present methodology is to evaluate structured securities held by insurers using the revised naic rating methodologies on an annual basis

the increase in otti losses on fixed maturity and equity securities primarily reflects impairments on greece sovereign debt securities of million as a result of the reduction in the expected recoverable amount see investments current environment and intent to sell fixed maturity security impairments on other sovereign debt securities due to the repositioning of the acquired alico portfolio into longer duration and higher yielding investments  resulting in total sovereign debt security impairments of million recognized in in addition  intent to sell impairments related to the divested businesses of million were recognized in primarily concentrated in the rmbs sector

mortgage loan credit quality monitoring process commercial and agricultural mortgage loans 
the company reviews all commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis 
these reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll  lease rollover analysis  property inspections  market analysis  estimated valuations of the underlying collateral  loan to value ratios  debt service coverage ratios  and tenant creditworthiness 
the monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans  which include those that are classified as restructured  potentially delinquent  delinquent or in foreclosure  as well as loans with higher loan to value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios 
the monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar  with a focus on higher risk loans  such as loans with higher loan to value ratios  including reviews on a geographic and property type basis 
loan to value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans 
loan to value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
a loan to value ratio greater than indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value 
a loan to value ratio of less than indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount 
the debt service coverage ratio compares a property s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan 
for commercial mortgage loans  the average loan to value ratio was and at december  and  respectively  and the average debt service coverage ratio was x at december   as compared to x at december  the commercial mortgage loan debt service coverage ratio and loan to value ratio  as well as the values utilized in calculating these ratios  are updated annually  on a rolling basis  with a portion of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio updated each quarter 
for agricultural mortgage loans  the average loan to value ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
the values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan to value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated

the company has a conservative residential mortgage loan portfolio and does not hold any option arms  sub prime or low teaser rate loans 
higher risk loans include those that are classified as restructured  potentially delinquent  delinquent or in foreclosure  as well as loans with higher loan to value ratios and interest only loans 
the company s investment in residential junior lien loans and residential mortgage loans with a loan to value ratio of or more was million and million at december  and  respectively  and certain of the higher loan to value residential mortgage loans have mortgage insurance coverage which reduces the loan to value ratio to less than 
additionally  the company s investment in traditional residential interest only mortgage loans was million and million at december  and  respectively 
mortgage loan valuation allowances 
the company s valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss  as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified  but for which the company expects to incur a loss 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses 
the company records additions to and decreases in its valuation allowances and gains and losses from the sale of loans in net investment gains losses 
the company records valuation allowances for loans considered to be impaired when it is probable that  based upon current information and events  the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loans being impaired  loan specific valuation allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the loan over either i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent  or iii the loan s observable market price 

table of contents the company also establishes valuation allowances for loan losses for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics  such as property types  loan to value ratios and debt service coverage ratios when  based on past experience  it is probable that a credit event has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
these valuation allowances are based on loan risk characteristics  historical default rates and loss severities  real estate market fundamentals and outlook  as well as other relevant factors 
the determination of the amount of  and additions or decreases to  valuation allowances is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with its loan portfolios 
such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors  including the company s experience for loan losses  defaults and loss severity  and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics 
these evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
we update our evaluations regularly  which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised 
negative credit migration including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans will result in an increase in the valuation allowance 
positive credit migration including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance 
such changes in the valuation allowance are recorded in net investment gains losses

table of contents policyholder liabilities we establish  and carry as liabilities  actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations when a policy matures or is surrendered  an insured dies or becomes disabled or upon the occurrence of other covered events  or to provide for future annuity payments 
amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported in the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap 
for more details on policyholder liabilities  see summary of critical accounting estimates 
due to the nature of the underlying risks and the high degree of uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities  the company cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities  and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts  particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future 
our actuarial liabilities for future benefits are adequate to cover the ultimate benefits required to be paid to policyholders 
we periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience 
we revise estimates  to the extent permitted or required under gaap  if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities 
insurance regulators in many of the non us countries in which metlife operates require certain metlife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves posted in the locally required regulatory financial statements  and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities 
see business international regulation 
we have experienced  and will likely in the future experience  catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism  and turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including pandemics  hurricanes  windstorms  earthquakes  hail  tornadoes  explosions  severe winter weather including snow  freezing water  ice storms and blizzards  fires and man made events such as terrorist attacks 
due to their nature  we cannot predict the incidence  timing  severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism  but we make broad use of catastrophic and non catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils 
future policy benefits we establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance products 
future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions  liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance  ltc policies  active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under participating life insurance contracts 
in order to manage risk  the company has often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on new individual life insurance policies 
the reinsurance programs are routinely evaluated and this may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage 
the company entered into various derivative positions  primarily interest rate swaps and swaptions  to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts 
retirement products 
future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life contingent income annuities  supplemental contracts with and without life contingencies  liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefits gmdbs included in certain annuity contracts  and a certain portion of guaranteed living benefits 
see variable annuity guarantees 
corporate benefit funding 
liabilities are primarily related to payout annuities  including pension closeouts and structured settlement annuities 
there is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities 
a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result  however  the company has employed various asset liability management strategies  including the use of various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors and interest rate swaps  to mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario 

table of contents auto home 
future policy benefits include liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies  levels of severities  inflation  judicial trends  legislative changes or regulatory decisions 
assumptions are based upon the company s historical experience and analyses of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business  and consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs  reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
japan and other international regions 
future policy benefits are held primarily for traditional life and accident and health contracts in japan  asia pacific and immediate annuities in latin america 
they are also held for total return pass thru provisions included in certain universal life and savings products mainly in japan and latin america  and traditional life  endowment and annuity contracts sold in various countries in asia pacific 
they also include certain liabilities for variable annuity guarantees of minimum death benefits  and longevity guarantees sold in japan and asia pacific 
finally  in europe and the middle east  they also include unearned premium liabilities established for credit insurance contracts covering death  disability and involuntary loss of employment  as well as traditional life  accident and health and endowment contracts 
factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at issue  lower than expected asset reinvestment rates  actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income  asset impairments  and actual mortality resulting in higher than expected benefit payments 
the company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and through the development of periodic experience studies 
see variable annuity guarantees 
estimates for the liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses are reset as actuarial indications change and these changes in the liability are reflected in the current results of operation as either favorable or unfavorable development of prior year losses 
corporate other 
future policy benefits primarily include liabilities for quota share reinsurance agreements for certain ltc and workers compensation business written by metlife insurance company of connecticut micc  prior to its acquisition by metlife  inc these are run off businesses that have been included within corporate other since the acquisition of micc 
policyholder account balances pabs are generally equal to the account value  which includes accrued interest credited  but exclude the impact of any applicable surrender charge that may be incurred upon surrender 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance products 
pabs are held for death benefit disbursement retained asset accounts  universal life policies  the fixed account of variable life insurance policies  specialized life insurance products for benefit programs and general account universal life policies 
pabs are credited interest at a rate set by the company  which are influenced by current market rates 
the majority of the pabs have a guaranteed minimum credited rate between and 
a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees 
the company has various derivative positions  primarily interest rate floors  to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario 
retirement products 
pabs are held for fixed deferred annuities and the fixed account portion of variable annuities  for certain income annuities  and for certain portions of guaranteed benefits 
pabs are credited interest at a rate set by the company 
credited rates for deferred annuities are influenced by current market rates  and most of these contracts have a minimum guaranteed rate between and 
see variable annuity guarantees 
corporate benefit funding 
pabs are comprised of funding agreements 
interest crediting rates vary by type of contract  and can be fixed or variable 
variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index  
table of contents most commonly month or month libor 
metlife is exposed to interest rate risks  and foreign exchange risk when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date 
the company may invest in floating rate assets  or enter into floating rate swaps  also tied to external indices  as well as caps to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company also mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and seeks to hedge all foreign currency risk through the use of foreign currency hedges  including cross currency swaps 
japan and other international regions 
pabs are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans in japan and latin america and to a lesser degree  amounts for unit linked type funds in certain countries across all regions that do not meet the gaap definition of separate accounts 
also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in japan and asia pacific that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees 
liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in japan and asia pacific are established in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance and are also included within pabs 
these liabilities are generally impacted by sustained periods of low interest rates  where there are interest rate guarantees 
the company mitigates its risks by implementing an asset liability matching policy and by hedging its variable annuity guarantees 
liabilities for unit linked type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments  as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder 
see variable annuity guarantees 
variable annuity guarantees the company issues  directly and through assumed reinsurance  certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit ie  the benefit base less withdrawals 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the net amount at risk nar for guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the nar disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements represents management s estimate of the current value of the benefits under these guarantees if they were all exercised simultaneously at december  and  respectively 
however  there are features  such as deferral periods and benefits requiring annuitization or death  that limit the amount of benefits that will be payable in the near future 
guarantees  including portions thereof  accounted for as embedded derivatives  are recorded at estimated fair value and included in pabs 
guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits  the non life contingent portion of guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits gmwb and the portion of certain gmib that do not require annuitization 
for more detail on the determination of estimated fair value  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees included in pabs at december  in millions us business guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit international guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit total included in net derivative gains losses for the years ended december  and were gains losses of billion and million  respectively  in embedded derivatives related to the change in estimated fair 
table of contents value of the guarantees 
the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk 
in connection with this adjustment  gains losses of billion and million are included in the gains losses of billion and million in net derivative gains losses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the estimated fair value of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  equity volatility  interest rates or foreign exchange rates 
additionally  because the estimated fair value for guarantees accounted for at estimated fair value includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk  a decrease in the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to increase 
conversely  a widening of the company s credit spreads could cause the value of these liabilities to decrease 
the company uses derivative instruments and reinsurance to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
the derivative instruments used are primarily equity and treasury futures  equity options and variance swaps  and interest rate swaps 
the change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk is not hedged 
the table below presents the estimated fair value of the derivatives hedging guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives primary underlying risk exposure instrument type december  notional amount estimated fair value notional amount estimated fair value assets liabilities assets liabilities in millions interest rate interest rate swaps   interest rate futures   interest rate options  foreign currency foreign currency forwards foreign currency futures equity market equity futures   equity options    variance swaps   total rate of return swaps total included in net derivative gains losses for the years ended december  and were gains losses of billion and million related to the change in estimated fair value of the above derivatives 
additionally  included in net derivative gains losses for the years ended december  and were gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to ceded reinsurance 
guarantees  including portions thereof  have liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits 
guarantees accounted for in this manner include gmdbs  the life contingent portion of certain gmwb  and the portion of gmib that require annuitization 
these liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns 
the scenarios use best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize deferred acquisition costs 
when current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected  liabilities will increase  resulting in a current period charge to net income 
the opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than that previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected 
at each reporting period  the company updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings 

table of contents the table below contains the carrying value for guarantees included in future policy benefits at december  in millions us business guaranteed minimum death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit international guaranteed minimum death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit total included in policyholder benefits and claims for the year ended december  is a charge of million and for the year ended december  is a charge of million  related to the respective change in liabilities for the above guarantees 
the carrying amount of guarantees accounted for as insurance liabilities can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance  increased equity volatility  or changes in interest rates 
the company uses reinsurance in combination with derivative instruments to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with these liabilities 
derivative instruments used are primarily equity futures  treasury futures and interest rate swaps 
included in policyholder benefits and claims associated with the hedging of the guarantees in future policy benefits for the year ended december  and were gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to reinsurance agreements containing embedded derivatives carried at estimated fair value and gains losses of million and million  respectively  related to freestanding derivatives 
while the company believes that the hedging strategies employed for guarantees included in both pabs and in future policy benefits  as well as other management actions  have mitigated the risks related to these benefits  the company remains liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay 
certain of the company s reinsurance agreements and most derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements  both of which  significantly reduces the exposure to counterparty risk 
in addition  the company is subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedures prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality  combined with adverse market events  produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed 
lastly  because the valuation of the guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives includes an adjustment for nonperformance risk that is not hedged  changes in the nonperformance risk may result in significant volatility in net income 
other policy related balances other policy related balances include policy and contract claims  unearned revenue liabilities  premiums received in advance  policyholder dividends due and unpaid  and policyholder dividends left on deposit

policyholder dividends payable policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
liquidity and capital resources overview our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the global economy 
stressed conditions  volatility and disruptions in global capital markets  particular markets  or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us  in part because we have a large investment portfolio 
table of contents and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors 
the global economy and markets are still affected by a period of significant stress that began in the second half of this disruption adversely affected the financial services sector  in particular  and global capital markets 
consequently  financial institutions paid higher spreads over benchmark us treasury securities than before the market disruption began 
beginning in and continuing throughout  concerns increased about capital markets and the solvency of certain european union member states and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries 
the japanese economy  to which we face substantial exposure given our operations there  was significantly negatively impacted by the march earthquake and tsunami 
disruptions to the japanese economy are having  and will continue to have  negative impacts on the overall global economy  not all of which can be foreseen 
although the august downgrade by s p of us treasury securities initially had an adverse effect on financial markets  the extent of the longer term impact cannot be predicted 
in november  fitch warned that it may in the future downgrade the us credit rating unless action is taken to reduce the national debt of the us it is possible that the august s p downgrade and any future downgrades  as well as continued concerns about us fiscal policy and the trajectory of the national debt of the us  could have severe repercussions to the us and global credit and financial markets  could further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and could disrupt economic activity in the us and elsewhere 
all of these factors could affect the company s ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain capital 
see industry trends  investments current environment and risk factors concerns over us fiscal policy and the trajectory of the national debt of the us  as well as rating agency downgrades of us treasury securities  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity management based upon the strength of its franchise  diversification of its businesses and strong financial fundamentals  we continue to believe the company has ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and unlikely but reasonably possible stress scenarios 
the company s short term liquidity position includes cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  excluding i cash collateral received under the company s securities lending program that has been reinvested in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and publicly traded securities  and ii cash collateral received from counterparties in connection with derivative instruments

capital management the company has established several senior management committees as part of its capital management process 
these committees  including the capital management committee and the enterprise risk committee comprised of members of senior management  including metlife  inc s chief financial officer  treasurer and chief risk officer and  in the case of the enterprise risk committee  metlife  inc s chief investment officer  regularly review actual and projected capital levels under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios and metlife s capital plan in accordance with its capital policy 
metlife s board and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of metlife s capital policy 
the capital policy sets forth  among other things  minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process 
all capital actions  including proposed changes to the capital plan  capital targets or capital policy  are reviewed by the finance and risk committee of the board prior to obtaining full board approval

table of contents the company liquidity liquidity refers to a company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs 
liquidity needs are determined from a rolling six month forecast by portfolio of investment assets and are monitored daily 
asset mix and maturities are adjusted based on the forecast 
cash flow testing and stress testing provide additional perspectives on liquidity  which include various scenarios of the potential risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal 
the company includes provisions limiting withdrawal rights on many of its products  including general account institutional pension products generally group annuities  including funding agreements  and certain deposit fund liabilities sold to employee benefit plan sponsors 
certain of these provisions prevent the customer from making withdrawals prior to the maturity date of the product 
in the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs  the company has various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need 
these options include cash flows from operations  the sale of liquid assets  global funding sources and various credit facilities 
under certain stressful market and economic conditions  the company s access to  or cost of  liquidity may deteriorate 
if the company requires significant amounts of cash on short notice in excess of anticipated cash requirements or is required to post or return cash collateral in connection with its investment portfolio  derivatives transactions or securities lending program  the company may have difficulty selling investment assets in a timely manner  be forced to sell them for less than the company otherwise would have been able to realize  or both 
in addition  in the event of such forced sale  accounting guidance require the recognition of a loss for certain securities in an unrealized loss position and may require the impairment of other securities based upon the company s ability to hold such securities  which may negatively impact the company s financial condition 
see risk factors some of our investments are relatively illiquid and are in asset classes that have been experiencing significant market valuation fluctuations 
in extreme circumstances  all general account assets within a particular legal entity other than those which may have been pledged to a specific purpose are available to fund obligations of the general account of that legal entity 
capital the company s capital position is managed to maintain its financial strength and credit ratings and is supported by its ability to generate strong cash flows at the operating companies  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise additional capital to meet its operating and growth needs 
the company was able to issue new debt and remarket outstanding debt during the difficult market conditions prevailing in the second half of and early  as well as during the rebound and recovery periods beginning in the second quarter of and continuing into the increase in credit spreads experienced during the crisis resulted in an increase in the cost of capital  as well as increases in facility fees 
most recently  as a result of reductions in interest rates and credit spreads  the company s interest expense and dividends on floating rate securities have been lower 
despite the still unsettled financial markets  the company also raised new capital from successful offerings of metlife  inc s common stock in august and march the august offering provided financing for the acquisition and the march offering provided financing for the repurchase from am holdings of metlife  inc s convertible preferred stock that was issued in connection with the acquisition 
see the company liquidity and capital sources convertible preferred stock and common stock 

table of contents rating agencies 
rating agencies assign insurer financial strength ratings to metlife  inc s domestic life insurance subsidiaries and credit ratings to metlife  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
the level and composition of regulatory capital at the subsidiary level and equity capital of the company are among the many factors considered in determining the company s insurer financial strength and credit ratings 
each agency has its own capital adequacy evaluation methodology  and assessments are generally based on a combination of factors 
in addition to heightening the level of scrutiny that they apply to insurance companies  rating agencies have increased and may continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews  may request additional information from the companies that they rate and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the rating agency models for maintenance of certain ratings levels 
a downgrade in the credit or insurer financial strength ratings of metlife  inc or its subsidiaries would likely impact the cost and availability of financing for metlife  inc and its subsidiaries and result in additional collateral requirements or other required payments under certain agreements  which are eligible to be satisfied in cash or by posting securities held by the subsidiaries subject to the agreements 
statutory capital and dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus well above levels to meet current regulatory requirements 
except for american life  rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit regulatory action 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of metlife  inc s domestic insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance laws provide insurance regulators the authority to require various actions by  or take various actions against  insurers whose total adjusted capital does not meet or exceed certain rbc levels 
at the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators  the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of each of those rbc levels 
american life does not conduct insurance business in delaware or any other domestic state and  as such  is exempt from rbc requirements by delaware law 
in addition to delaware  american life operations are regulated by applicable authorities of the countries in which the company operates and are subject to capital and solvency requirements in those countries 
the amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries can pay to metlife  inc or other parent entities is constrained by the amount of surplus we hold to maintain our ratings and provides an additional margin for risk protection and investment in our businesses 
we proactively take actions to maintain capital consistent with these ratings objectives  which may include adjusting dividend amounts and deploying financial resources from internal or external sources of capital 
certain of these activities may require regulatory approval 
furthermore  the payment of dividends and other distributions to metlife  inc and other parent entities by their respective insurance subsidiaries is regulated by insurance laws and regulations

included within future policy benefits are contracts where the company is currently making payments and will continue to do so until the occurrence of a specific event  such as death  as well as those where the timing of a portion of the payments has been determined by the contract 
also included are contracts where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death or illness  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of a policy or contract  is outside the control of the company 
the company has estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience  as well as its expectation of future payment patterns 
liabilities related to accounting conventions  or which are not contractually due  such as shadow liabilities  excess interest reserves and property and casualty loss adjustment expenses  of billion have been excluded from amounts presented in the table above 
amounts presented in the table above  excluding those related to property and casualty contracts  represent the estimated cash payments for benefits under such contracts including assumptions related to the receipt of future premiums and assumptions related to mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  inflation  disability incidence  disability terminations  policy loans and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
payments for case reserve liabilities and incurred but not reported liabilities associated with property and casualty contracts of billion have been included using an estimate of the ultimate amount to be settled under the policies based upon historical payment patterns 
the ultimate amount to be paid under property and casualty contracts is not determined until the company reaches a settlement with the claimant  which may vary significantly from the liability or contractual obligation presented above  especially as it relates to incurred but not reported liabilities 
all estimated cash payments presented in the table above are undiscounted as to interest  net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
the more than five years category includes estimated payments due for periods extending for more than years from the present date 
the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to the time value of money  which accounts for at least of the difference  as well as differences in assumptions  most significantly mortality  between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date 
for the majority of the company s insurance operations  estimated contractual obligations for future policy benefits and policyholder account balance liabilities as presented in the table above are derived from the annual asset adequacy analysis used to develop actuarial opinions of statutory reserve adequacy for state regulatory purposes 
these cash flows are materially representative of the cash flows under gaap 
see policyholder account balances below 
actual cash payments to policyholders may differ significantly from the liabilities as presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the estimated cash payments as presented in the table above due to differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in the establishment of these liabilities and the estimation of these cash payments 

table of contents policyholder account balances pabs include liabilities related to conventional guaranteed interest contracts  guaranteed interest contracts associated with formal offering programs  funding agreements  individual and group annuities  total control accounts  individual and group universal life  variable universal life and company owned life insurance 
included within pabs are contracts where the amount and timing of the payment is essentially fixed and determinable 
these amounts relate to policies where the company is currently making payments and will continue to do so  as well as those where the timing of the payments has been determined by the contract 
other contracts involve payment obligations where the timing of future payments is uncertain and where the company is not currently making payments and will not make payments until the occurrence of an insurable event  such as death  or where the occurrence of the payment triggering event  such as a surrender of or partial withdrawal on a policy or deposit contract  is outside the control of the company 
the company has estimated the timing of the cash flows related to these contracts based on historical experience  as well as its expectation of future payment patterns

such estimated cash payments are also presented net of estimated future premiums on policies currently in force and gross of any reinsurance recoverable 
for obligations denominated in foreign currencies  cash payments have been estimated using current spot rates 
the sum of the estimated cash flows shown for all years in the table of billion exceeds the liability amount of billion included on the consolidated balance sheet principally due to the time value of money  which accounts for at least of the difference  as well as differences in assumptions between the date the liabilities were initially established and the current date 
see the comments under future policy benefits above regarding the source and uncertainties associated with the estimation of the contractual obligations related to future policyholder benefits and pabs 
other policyholder liabilities other policyholder liabilities are comprised of other policy related balances  policyholder dividends payable and the policyholder dividend obligation

liabilities related to unearned revenue and negative voba of billion and billion  respectively  have been excluded from the cash payments presented in the table above because they reflect accounting conventions and not contractual obligations 
with the exception of policyholder dividends left on deposit  and those items excluded as noted in the preceding sentence  the contractual obligation presented in the table above related to other policy related balances is equal to the liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
such amounts are reported in the one year or less category due to the short term nature of the liabilities 
contractual obligations on policyholder dividends left on deposit are projected based on assumptions of policyholder withdrawal activity 

table of contents b 
policyholder dividends payable consists of liabilities related to dividends payable in the following calendar year on participating policies 
as such  the contractual obligation related to policyholder dividends payable is presented in the table above in the one year or less category at the amount of the liability presented in the consolidated balance sheet 
c 
the nature of the policyholder dividend obligation is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because the exact timing and amount of the ultimate policyholder dividend obligation is subject to significant uncertainty and the amount of the policyholder dividend obligation is based upon a long term projection of the performance of the closed block  we have reflected the obligation at the amount of the liability  if any  presented in the consolidated balance sheet in the more than five years category 
this was presented to reflect the long duration of the liability and the uncertainty of the ultimate cash payment 
payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions the company has accepted cash collateral in connection with securities lending and derivative transactions 
as the securities lending transactions expire within the next year or the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain  the return of the collateral has been included in the one year or less category in the table above 
the company also holds non cash collateral  which is not reflected as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet  of billion at december  bank deposits bank deposits of billion exceed the amount on the balance sheet of billion due to the inclusion of estimated interest payments 
liquid deposits  including demand deposit accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts  are assumed to mature at carrying value within one year 
certificates of deposit are assumed to pay all interest and principal at maturity 
short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities amounts presented in the table above for short term debt  long term debt  collateral financing arrangements and junior subordinated debt securities differ from the balances presented on the consolidated balance sheet  as the amounts presented in the table above do not include premiums or discounts upon issuance or purchase accounting fair value adjustments 
the amounts presented above also include future interest on such obligations as described below 
short term debt consists of borrowings with original maturities of one year or less carrying fixed interest rates 
the contractual obligation for short term debt presented in the table above represents the principal amounts due upon maturity plus the related future interest for the period from january  through maturity 
long term debt bears interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from january  through maturity 
future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
long term debt also includes payments under capital lease obligations of million  million  million and million  in the one year or less  more than one year to three years  more than three years to five years and more than five years categories  respectively 
long term debt presented in the table above excludes billion at december  of long term debt relating to cses 
collateral financing arrangements bear interest at fixed and variable interest rates through their respective maturity dates 
future interest on fixed rate debt was computed using the stated rate on the obligations for the period from january  through maturity 
future interest on variable rate debt was computed using prevailing rates at december  and  as such  does not consider the impact of future rate movements 
pursuant to these collateral financing arrangements  metlife  inc may be required to deliver cash or pledge collateral to the respective unaffiliated financial institutions 
see the company liquidity and capital sources collateral financing arrangements 

table of contents junior subordinated debt securities bear interest at fixed interest rates through their respective redemption dates 
future interest was computed using the stated rates on the obligations for the period from january  through the scheduled redemption dates  as it is the company s expectation that the debt will be redeemed at that time 
inclusion of interest payments on junior subordinated debt through the final maturity dates would increase the contractual obligation by billion 
commitments to lend funds the company commits to lend funds under mortgage loans  partnerships  bank credit facilities  bridge loans and private corporate bond investments 
in the table above  the timing of the funding of mortgage loans and private corporate bond investments is based on the expiration dates of the corresponding commitments 
as it relates to commitments to lend funds to partnerships and under bank credit facilities  the company anticipates that these amounts could be invested any time over the next five years  however  as the timing of the fulfillment of the obligation cannot be predicted  such obligations are presented in the one year or less category in the table above 
commitments to fund bridge loans are short term obligations and  as a result  are presented in the one year or less category in the table above 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and off balance sheet arrangements 
operating leases as a lessee  the company has various operating leases  primarily for office space 
contractual provisions exist that could increase or accelerate those lease obligations presented  including various leases with early buyouts and or escalation clauses

other other liabilities presented in the table above are principally comprised of amounts due under reinsurance agreements  payables related to securities purchased but not yet settled  securities sold short  accrued interest on debt obligations  estimated fair value of derivative obligations  deferred compensation arrangements  guaranty liabilities  the estimated fair value of forward stock purchase contracts  the liability related to securitized reverse residential mortgage loans  and general accruals and accounts payable due under contractual obligations 
if the timing of any of the other liabilities is sufficiently uncertain  the amounts are included within the one year or less category 
the other liabilities presented in the table above differ from the amount presented in the consolidated balance sheet by billion due primarily to the exclusion of items such as legal liabilities  pension and postretirement benefit obligations  taxes due other than income tax  unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest  accrued severance and employee incentive compensation and other liabilities such as deferred gains and losses 
such items have been excluded from the table above as they represent accounting conventions or are not liabilities due under contractual obligations 
the net funded status of the company s pension and other postretirement liabilities included within other liabilities has been excluded from the amounts presented in the table above 
rather  the amounts presented represent the discretionary contributions of million expected to be made by the company to the pension plan in and the contributions of million expected to be made by the company to the postretirement benefit plans during virtually all contributions to the pension and postretirement benefit plans are made by the insurance subsidiaries of metlife  inc with little impact on metlife  inc s cash flows 
excluded from the table above are unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest of million and million  respectively  for which the company cannot reliably determine the timing of payment 
current income tax payable is also excluded from the table 
separate account liabilities are excluded from the table above 
generally  the separate account owner  rather than the company  bears the investment risk of these funds 
the separate account assets are legally segregated and are not subject to the claims that arise out of any other business of the company 
net deposits  net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the separate accounts are fully offset 
table of contents by corresponding amounts credited to contractholders whose liability is reflected with the separate account liabilities 
separate account liabilities are fully funded by cash flows from the separate account assets and are set equal to the estimated fair value of separate account assets 
the company also enters into agreements to purchase goods and services in the normal course of business  however  these purchase obligations were not material to its consolidated results of operations or financial position at december  additionally  the company has agreements in place for services it conducts  generally at cost  between subsidiaries relating to insurance  reinsurance  loans and capitalization 
intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate insurance regulators as required 
support agreements 
metlife  inc and several of its subsidiaries each  an obligor are parties to various capital support commitments  guarantees and contingent reinsurance agreements with certain subsidiaries of metlife  inc under these arrangements  each obligor  with respect to the applicable entity  has agreed to cause such entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels  has guaranteed certain contractual obligations or has agreed to provide  upon the occurrence of certain contingencies  reinsurance for such entity s insurance liabilities 
we anticipate that in the event that these arrangements place demands upon the company  there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable the company to meet anticipated demands

litigation 
putative or certified class action litigation and other litigation  and claims and assessments against the company  in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements  have arisen in the course of the company s business  including  but not limited to  in connection with its activities as an insurer  mortgage lending bank  employer  investor  investment advisor and taxpayer 
further  state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning the company s compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations 
the company establishes liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
for material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable  no accrual is made but the company discloses the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued  when such an estimate can be made 
it is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings 
in some of the matters referred to herein  very large and or indeterminate amounts  including punitive and treble damages  are sought 
although in light of these considerations  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon the company s financial position  based on information currently known by the company s management  in its opinion  the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect 
however  given the large and or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation  it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could  from time to time  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 

table of contents metlife  inc capital restrictions and limitations on bank holding companies and financial holding companies 
metlife  inc and its insured depository institution subsidiary  metlife bank  are subject to risk based and leverage capital guidelines issued by the federal banking regulatory agencies for banks and bank and financial holding companies

most of the non us subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non us holding companies 
the capital and rating considerations applicable to the first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into metlife  inc the company s management actively manages its target and excess capital levels and dividend flows on a proactive basis and forecasts local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle 
the dividend capacity of certain us and us subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company must effectively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with its assets and liabilities 
it has developed an integrated process for managing risk  which it conducts through its enterprise risk management department  asset liability management unit  treasury department and investment department along with the management of the business segments 
the company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 
the company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate  equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
as a result of that analysis  the company has determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets 
enterprise risk management 
metlife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve alm strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
further enhancing its committee structure  during the second quarter of  metlife created an enterprise risk committee including the following voting members the chief financial officer  the chief investment officer and the chief risk officer 
this committee is responsible for reviewing all material risks to the enterprise and deciding on actions if necessary  in the event risks exceed desirable targets  taking into consideration best practices to resolve or mitigate those risks 
metlife also has a separate enterprise risk management department  which is responsible for risk management throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief risk officer 
the enterprise risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a corporate risk framework  which outlines the company s approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  
table of contents developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring  monitoring and controlling those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the finance and risk committee of the company s board of directors  with respect to credit risk  reporting to the investment committee of the company s board of directors  and reporting on various aspects of risk to financial and non financial senior management committees 
asset liability management 
the company actively manages its assets using an approach that balances quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity  concentration and investment return 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are reasonably managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the alm process is the shared responsibility of the financial risk management and asset liability management unit  enterprise risk management  the portfolio management unit  and the senior members of the business segments and is governed by the alm committees 
the alm committees duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the alm process on a periodic basis 
the directives of the alm committees are carried out and monitored through alm working groups which are set up to manage by product type 
in addition  an alm steering committee oversees the activities of the underlying alm committees 
metlife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality by the alm working groups 
market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity market 
interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results most significantly from its holdings of fixed maturity securities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term interest rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include debt  pabs related to certain investment type contracts  and net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits which have the same type of interest rate exposure medium and long term interest rates as fixed maturity securities 
the company employs product design  pricing and alm strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate movements 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products and the ability to reset credited rates for certain products 
alm strategies include the use of derivatives and duration mismatch limits 
see risk factors changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage loans  and certain liabilities  as well as through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios and liabilities are the euro  the japanese yen  the british pound  the mexican peso and the canadian dollar 
selectively  the company uses us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 

table of contents through its investments in foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures  the company is primarily exposed to the japanese yen  the polish zloty  the mexican peso  the british pound  the australian dollar  the euro  the korean won and the canadian dollar 
in addition to hedging with foreign currency swaps  forwards and options  local surplus in some countries is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk 
the company has matched much of its foreign currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing its risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
see risk factors fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect our profitability 
equity market 
the company has exposure to equity market risk through certain liabilities that involve long term guarantees on equity performance such as net embedded derivatives on variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefits  certain pabs along with investments in equity securities 
we manage this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through our alm strategies including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefits 
the company also manages equity market risk exposure in its investment portfolio through the use of derivatives 
equity exposures associated with other limited partnership interests are excluded from this section as they are not considered financial instruments under gaap 
management of market risk exposures the company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk  including the use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk management 
to manage interest rate risk  the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models  including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
the department of financial services regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of alm and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the business segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each asset portfolio has a duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments  derivatives or curve mismatch strategies 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk management 
foreign currency exchange rate risk is assumed primarily in three ways investments in foreign subsidiaries  purchases of foreign currency denominated investments in the investment portfolio and the sale of certain insurance products 
the company s treasury department is responsible for managing the exposure to investments in foreign subsidiaries 
limits to exposures are established and monitored by the treasury department and managed by the investment department

metlife uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to mitigate the liability exposure  risk of loss and the volatility of net income associated with its investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated fixed income investments and the sale of certain insurance products 
equity market risk management 
equity market risk exposure through the issuance of variable annuities is managed by the company s asset liability management unit in partnership with the investment department 
equity market risk is realized through its investment in equity securities and is managed by its investment department 
metlife uses derivatives to mitigate its equity exposure both in certain liability guarantees such as variable annuities with guaranteed minimum benefit and equity securities 
these derivatives include exchange traded equity futures  equity index options contracts and equity variance swaps 
the company also employs reinsurance to manage these exposures 
hedging activities 
metlife uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a wide range of risks including interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and equity risk 
derivative hedges are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on accounting results and gaap and statutory capital 
the construction of the company s derivative hedge programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged 
some hedge programs are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedges that reduce risk related to a group of liabilities or assets 
the company s use of derivatives by major hedge programs is as follows risks related to living guarantee benefits the company uses a wide range of derivative contracts to hedge the risk associated with variable annuity living guarantee benefits 
these hedges include equity and interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  currency futures forwards  equity indexed options and interest rate option contracts and equity variance swaps 
minimum interest rate guarantees for certain company liability contracts  the company provides the contractholder a guaranteed minimum interest rate

reinvestment risk in long duration liability contracts derivatives are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contracts  such as deferred annuities 
hedges include zero coupon interest rate swaps and swaptions

these hedges primarily swap foreign currency denominated bonds  investments in foreign subsidiaries or equity exposures to us dollars 

table of contents general alm hedging strategies in the ordinary course of managing the company s asset liability risks  the company uses interest rate futures  interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  interest rate floors and inflation swaps 
these hedges are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing assets or liabilities or related to expected future cash flows 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its market sensitive assets and liabilities based on changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in estimated fair value based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing the analysis summarized below  the company used market rates at december  the sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of the company s market risk exposures interest rate  equity market and foreign currency exchange rate relating to its trading and non trading assets and liabilities 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the estimated fair values of its market sensitive assets and liabilities as follows the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the us dollar equivalent estimated fair values of the company s foreign currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in foreign currency exchange rates  and the estimated fair value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity market prices 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot ensure that its actual losses in any particular period will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  for the derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the period 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not as substitutes for the experience and judgment of its management 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain assets and liabilities from interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and equity exposures
