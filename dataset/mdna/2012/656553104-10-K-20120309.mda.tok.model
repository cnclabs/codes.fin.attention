we serve three major markets within the ems industry aerospace and defense  medical  and the industrial market which includes industrial equipment  transportation  vision  agriculture  oil and gas 
in minnesota  we have facilities in baxter  bemidji  blue earth  mankato  merrifield  milaca and wayzata 
we also have facilities in augusta  wisconsin and monterrey  mexico 
the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products built to the customer s design specifications and consists of a wide range of simple to highly complex manufacturing processes 
during  we continued our supply chain and lean manufacturing initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve asset utilization and increase responsiveness to customers 
our initiatives focused on improving quality and on time delivery as well as improving our manufacturing processes and yields by doing it right the first time 
our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base by focusing on sales and marketing efforts that fit our value added service strategy 
our mexico operation allows for medium volume and mix with lower cost production alternatives when the opportunities are presented 
our net sales in were million  an increase of compared to our growth in revenue came from our recent acquisitions  offsetting shortfalls in sales and orders from our existing industrial customers that are being hit the hardest by the uncertainty in the economy 
our customers are still wary about carrying large amounts of inventory and their ability to accurately forecast 
our day backlog at december  was million with million included from the mankato acquisition  compared to million at the end of we saw our gross profit improve in as a result of a favorable mix of product and services  along with cost and efficiency initiatives in our manufacturing processes 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income from operations totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net income in was million or per diluted common share  million or per diluted common share excluding the bargain purchase gain of million  net of tax 
net income totaled million or per diluted common share in cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million directly related to the working capital requirements needed to support the acquisition of the mankato operation 
we believe our financing arrangements and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs through the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical estimates that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of manufactured products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we also provide engineering services separate from the manufacture of a product 
revenue for engineering services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  providing standalone fair value to our customers 
our engineering services are short term in nature 
in addition  we have another separate source of revenue that comes from short term repair services  which are recognized upon completion of the repairs  and the repaired products are shipped back to the customer 
shipping and handling costs charged to our customers are 
table of contents included in net sales  while the corresponding shipping expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
business combinations we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations 
we recognize amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values 
we hired a third party valuation specialist to determine the value of property and equipment acquired 
transaction and integration costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred 
any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill while any excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition price is recorded in current earnings as a gain 
allowance for uncollectible accounts when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on outstanding accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of accounts receivable  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have historically not experienced significant bad debts expense and believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our inventory based on current usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we believe the total reserve at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge might be required to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
we recorded impairment charges in and of  and  respectively  related to a building sold on december  valuation allowance we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against these assets  thereby increasing income tax expense or decreasing the income tax benefit in the period the determination is made 
as of december  we expect to recover our deferred tax assets in their entirety  and thus no valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting estimates and the underlying judgments and uncertainties of those estimates  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates 
table of contents included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially 
operating results the following table presents statement of operations data as percentages of net sales for the indicated year net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expenses  net income tax expense net income net sales for the years ended december  and  we had net sales of million and million  respectively  an increase of

net sales to our medical and industrial customers increased by million and million  respectively  primarily due to the acquisition of our mankato facility which added million in sales to the medical market and million of sales to the industrial market 
the increase in net sales to the industrial market resulting from the acquisition  was offset by shortfalls from our existing industrial customers that are being hit the hardest by the uncertainty in the economy 
backlog our day backlog was approximately million on december   including million related to the january acquisition  compared to million at december  our backlog consists of firm purchase orders and we expect a major portion of the current day backlog to be realized as revenue during the following quarter 
backlog as of the year ended december  in thousands change aerospace and defense medical industrial total backlog our day backlog varies due to order size  manufacturing delays  contract terms and conditions and timing from customer delivery schedules and releases 
these variables cause inconsistencies in comparing the backlog from one period to the next

net income in was million or per diluted common share 
financial condition and liquidity we believe that our existing financing arrangements and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investments  and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
credit facility our credit agreement with wells fargo bank wfb provides for a line of credit arrangement of million  which expires on may   if not renewed 
the credit arrangement also has a real estate term note with a maturity date of may  and an equipment term loan tied to equipment purchased in the mankato acquisition 
we are in negotiations to finalize and extend our real estate term note prior to maturity 
the line of credit and other installment debt with wfb contain certain covenants which  among other things  require us to adhere to regular reporting requirements  abide by annual shareholder dividend limitations  maintain certain financial performance  and limit the amount of annual capital expenditures 
the availability under the line is subject to borrowing base requirements  and advances are at the discretion of the lender 
the line is secured by substantially all of our assets 
this commitment is summarized as described below other commercial commitment total amount committed outstanding at december  date of expiration line of credit   may  as of december  we have net unused availability under our line of credit agreement of approximately million as supported by our borrowing base 
cash flow december cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease in cash on december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to million at the end of during  we used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
the cash used in operations was primarily the result of working capital requirements needed to support the acquired mankato operations 
our net cash used in investing activities of million is due to million of capital equipment purchases and million for the mankato acquisition in january net cash provided by financing activities of million consisted of a million increase in the line of credit and million of additional borrowings  offset by payments of million on long term debt
