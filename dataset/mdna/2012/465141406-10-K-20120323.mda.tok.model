item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify these forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend  or continue  and similar expressions 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the united states and an owner of various royalty interests offshore israel 
our properties are primarily located in texas  new mexico and oklahoma and israel 
we act as the operator of most of our us properties 
historically  we have grown through acquisitions  with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs 
in we created a new subsidiary that provides well maintenance and workover services  well completion and recompletion services 

table of contents our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors  and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
at december   our estimated total proved oil  natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids  as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firms  netherland  sewell associates  inc and cawley  gillespie associates  inc  were approximately  thousand barrels of oil equivalent mboe  consisting of  thousand barrels mbbls of oil  and  million cubic feet mmcf of natural gas and  thousand barrels mbbls of natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed see note supplemental oil and gas information to consolidated financial statements to our consolidated financial statements 
full year production averaged mboe d compared to mboe d in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
oil and natural gas activities accounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved oil and natural gas reserves isramco estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the sec and the fasb 
this definition includes crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods  government regulations  etc  ie  at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made 
prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements  and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data  as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually by our independent reserve engineering firm  cawley  gillespie associates  inc and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions  and governmental restrictions  as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier 
a material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on dd a and could result in property impairments 
depreciation  depletion and amortization our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 

table of contents impairment we review our property and equipment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment asc 
asc requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value 
further  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future 
additionally  these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of obligations and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next and months  respectively 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts  which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations 
we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets  with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs 
our results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivative contracts 
environmental obligations and other contingencies management makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation  litigation  and other contingent matters 
provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made 
estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters  including  but not limited to  the stage of investigation  the stage of the remedial design  evaluation of existing remediation technologies  and presently enacted laws and regulations 
in future periods  a number of factors could significantly change the company s estimate of environmental remediation costs  such as changes in laws and regulations  changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations  revisions to the remedial design  unanticipated construction problems  identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater  and changes in costs of labor  equipment  and technology 
consequently  it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the company s estimates 
the company s in house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities and  in certain circumstances  consults with third party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the company s conclusion 
income taxes the company follows asc  income taxes  asc  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary historical sources of capital and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations  availability under our senior credit agreement with our unrelated bank lenders with bank of nova scotia senior credit agreements and loans from various related party lenders related party loans and asset dispositions 
we continuously monitor our liquidity and evaluate our development plans in light of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  our cash flows  capital resources and drilling success 

table of contents note to our consolidated financial statements  long term debt and interest expense  describes the senior credit agreements and related party loans 
our senior credit agreements originally provided a total million in credit facilities 
as of december   the total available borrowing base was zero 
on march  the company terminated its relationship with wells fargo and repaid its outstanding balance 
the borrowing base which relates to our oil and natural gas properties is redetermined on a semi annual basis with the company and the lenders each having the right to one unscheduled redetermination per year and adjusted based on our oil and natural gas properties  reserves  other indebtedness and other relevant factors 
during the fourth quarter of the lenders reduced the borrowing base to the company is repaying the approximately  outstanding balance in six installments of  each with the first two payments already made for january and february and the remaining installments due each month thereafter through june when the entire balance will be repaid 
the company is also in negotiations for similar credit facilities with several other commercial lenders  to obtain terms most favorable to the company 
while optimistic of a positive outcome of our consolidation efforts  the company is uncertain as to whether it will be successful in obtaining new replacement financing or  if it is obtained  the timetable upon which such facility will be closed and other material terms and conditions 
the company believes that during the interim period that the terms of existing affiliate financing will remain flexible and additional funding will be made available if needed until a new credit facility can be entered 
see note to consolidated financial statements  long term debt and interest expense 
our future capital resources and liquidity may depend  in part  on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we have acquired 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success in finding and acquiring additional reserves 
we expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit agreements 
long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and prices and our commodity price hedging activities as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry

c 
israel oil company  ltd  an affiliate of the company ioc pursuant to which it borrowed the sum of million 
the loan bears interest at a rate of per annum and is payable in quarterly payments of interest only until march   when all accrued interest and principal is due and payable 
the loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
the loan is unsecured 
the purpose of the loan was to provide funds to isramco for the payment of amounts due under the wells fargo senior credit facility at maturity 
on march  isramco paid the outstanding principal balance due under the wells fargo senior credit agreement 
subsequently  on march   pursuant to an agreement with wells fargo  the derivative contracts between isramco and wells fargo were terminated at a cost to the company of approximately  concurrently  the company entered into new derivative contracts for  barrels of crude oil during the month period commencing march with macquarie bank  na during september isramco paid  of principal and interest pursuant to loan agreement with ioc 
the company is actively pursuing a consolidation of all outstanding debt with macquarie bank and other commercial lenders 
in october the agreement with ioc  pertaining to a loan in the outstanding principal amount of  was renegotiated 
the payoff of principal amount was extended by months to september  interest accrued per annum was determined on libor from initial 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
cash flow our primary source of cash in was cash flow from operating activities  loans from related party and proceeds from sale of investment in mediamind ltd shares 
our primary source of cash in and was our operating activities 
in cash received from operations  from selling of investment in mediamind ltd shares and from related party was offset by repayments of borrowings under our senior credit agreements  repayment of related party loans  purchase of equipment and payments made on settled derivatives contracts 
in and  cash received from operations was offset by repayments of borrowings under our senior credit agreements and cash used in payments on addition to oil and gas properties  net of any divestiture activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
see results of operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash operating activities  net cash flows provided by operating activities were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes  hedging activities and operating cost 
during the year ended december   compared to the same period in  net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased by  to  this decrease was primarily attributable to net cash paid on settled derivatives contracts of  less cash received on proceeds from settlements of derivative contracts  higher lease operating expenses all of which were partially offset by increased oil and natural gas liquids ngls revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher average oil and ngls prices for the year ended december  of bbl and bbl respectively  compared to bbl and bbl for the year ended december  however  we are unable to predict future production levels or future commodity prices  and  therefore  we cannot predict future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in compared to primarily due to a reduction in working capital of  higher lease operating expenses and expenses related to our well plugging and abandonment obligations 
the reduction in net cash proceeds from our commodity price hedging activities of  was offset by increased oil and natural gas revenues of  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher average oil  gas and ngls prices for the year ended december  of bbl  mcf and bbl  compared to bbl  mcf and bbl for the year ended december  investing activities  the primary driver of cash provided by investing activities in was proceeds from sale of marketable securities which was offset by purchase of other property and equipment of approximately  and an additional  spent on capital expenditures

to assess the operating results of isramco  management analyzes income from operations before income taxes  interest expense  exploration expense  unrealized gain loss on derivative contracts and dd a expense and impairments adjusted ebitdax 
adjusted ebitdax is not a gaap measure 
isramco s definition of adjusted ebitdax excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period  but rather is monitored by management as a part of the costs incurred in exploration and development activities 
similarly  isramco excludes dd a expense and impairments from adjusted ebitdax as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to isramco s financing methods or capital structure 
adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make payments on its long term loans 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations 
however  adjusted ebitdax  as defined by isramco  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  isramco s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with income loss from operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of isramco s results as reported under gaap
