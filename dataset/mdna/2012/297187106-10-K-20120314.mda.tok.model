overview history essex rental corp 
formerly  hyde park acquisition corp 
was incorporated in delaware on august  as a blank check company whose objective was to effect a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business 
we consummated our initial public offering on march  all activity from august  inception through march  relates to our formation and initial public offering 
from march  through october   our activities were limited to identifying prospective target businesses to acquire and complete a business combination 
on october   we consummated the acquisition of holdings and its wholly owned subsidiary  essex crane  and  as a result  we are no longer in the development stage 
in august  we formed a new subsidiary  essex finance corp  to facilitate the acquisition of rental equipment 
in november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of coast liquidating co 
formerly known as coast crane company through a newly formed subsidiary cc bidding corp  which subsequently changed its name to coast crane company 
the assets acquired in the coast acquisition consisted of all of the assets used in the operation of coast liquidating co 
s specialty lifting solutions and crane rental services business  including cranes and related heavy lifting machinery and equipment and spare parts  inventory  accounts receivable  rights under executory contracts  other tangible and intangible assets and all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of coast crane ltd  a british columbia corporation  through which coast liquidating co 
conducted its operations in canada 
for more information regarding our acquisition of coast crane company  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
business through our operating subsidiaries  essex crane and coast crane  we are one of north america s largest providers of lifting equipment including lattice boom crawler cranes  truck cranes and rough terrain cranes  tower cranes  and other lifting equipment used in a wide array of construction projects 
in addition  we provide product support including installation  maintenance  repair  and parts and services for our equipment provided to customers and customer owned equipment 
with a fleet of over  cranes and other construction equipment and customer service and support  we supply a wide variety of innovative lifting solutions for construction projects related to power generation  petro chemical  refineries  water treatment and purification  bridges  highways  hospitals  shipbuilding  offshore oil fabrication and industrial plants  and commercial and residential construction 
we rent our equipment bare  meaning without supplying an operator and  in exchange for a fee  make arrangements for the transportation and delivery of equipment 
once the crane is delivered and erected on the customer s site  inspected and determined to be operating properly by the customer s crane operator and management  the majority of the maintenance and repair costs are the responsibility of the customer while the equipment is on rent 
this business model allows us to minimize our headcount and operating costs including reduced liability related to operator error and provides the customer with a more flexible situation where they control the crane and the operator s work schedule 
over the past several years  we have been focused on reinvesting capital into our rental fleet 
specifically  we have sold lower lifting capacity cranes for better utilized heavier lifting capacity cranes 
during the years ended december     and the company invested approximately million  million  million  million and million  respectively into new cranes and attachments for our rental fleet 
these investment decisions contributed greatly to the repositioning our fleet to maximize its utilization rates and average rental rates 
although we believe the repositioning of the fleet has maximized utilization rates and average rental rates  the economic downturn has significantly adversely impacted our business activity levels 
the following table provides a summary of utilization rates calculated using the days method for the years ended december  and for the equipment types owned during those periods

as a result of the acquisition of coast crane  the company now provides services that it had not in the past  including equipment distribution and parts and service to third parties not renting the company s equipment 
we have identified three reportable segments equipment rentals  equipment distribution  and parts and service 
these segments are based upon how management of the company allocates resources and assesses performance

the effective tax rates were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate increased from the prior year due to an increase in state tax rates resulting primarily from changes in apportionment resulting from the coast acquisition 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was higher than the statutory tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
the lower effective tax rate in related to the tax expenses related to an increase in state deferred tax rates at essex crane as a result of the acquisition of coast crane and an additional state nol valuation allowance  which were partially offset by the reduction in unrecognized benefit associated with the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions 
the essex crane state deferred tax rates increased in due to an increase in apportionment into higher tax states which coast crane operates due to unitary filing requirements 
essex had full time employees as of december  compared to full time employees at december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  prior to the acquisition of coast crane in november  the company had only one operating segment related to equipment rentals

year ended december  revenues equipment rentals   new equipment sales  used rental equipment sales   retail part sales  transportation   equipment repairs and maintenance   total revenues   revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  revenue was comprised of the following components equipment rentals revenues  which represented of total revenues  was million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  this decrease was first driven by a decrease in crane utilization to under the days method or if calculated using the hits method for the year ended december  from under the days method or if calculated using the hits method for the year ended december  the decrease in utilization was a result of excess market supply of rental equipment compared to the demand brought on by the weakened economy and a difficult commercial credit environment 
second  the company also experienced the associated decrease in the average crawler crane rental rate of to  per crane per rental month for the year ended december  relative to  for the year ended december  the decrease in the average rental rate is due to the expiration of rental agreements executed at higher rental rates in the prior years 
new equipment sales revenues  which represented of total revenues  was million for the year ended december  and relates to new equipment sales by our coast crane subsidiary acquired in november used rental equipment sales revenues  which represented of total revenues  were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  these used equipment sales have presented essex crane with opportunities to further enhance its combination of cranes and attachments by providing an additional cash flow source for purchasing additional new rental equipment 
five lower lifting capacity crawler cranes and attachments were sold for the year ended december  which was a decrease from thirteen for the year ended december  in both periods the market presented opportunities to sell a number of the lower utilization units which have lower rental rates  and essex crane reinvested the proceeds of such sales into a smaller number of larger cranes and attachments which yield higher utilization rates and higher relative rental rates on the capital costs and enable essex crane to improve the strategic position of its rental fleet for the future 
the average lifting capacity of five cranes sold was tons and tons for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to tons and tons for cranes purchased during the same periods  respectively 
cranes sold during the year ended december  were sold at an average price in excess of of orderly liquidation value olv 
olv is determined for collateral measurement purposes by an independent appraiser on behalf of the lead lender for the company s asset based revolving credit facility  retail part sales revenues  which represented of total revenue  were million for the year ended december  and relates to retail part sales from our coast crane subsidiary acquired in november transportation revenues  which represented of total revenues were million for the year ended december   a decrease from million for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of lower average crane rental utilization and was impacted by the combination of cranes and attachments rented and the specific distances that equipment had to move for various rentals  and equipment repairs and maintenance revenues including rigging and other services  which represented of total revenue  were million for the year ended december   an decrease from million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributed to a lower demand for repairs  maintenance and other services resulting from lower average crane rental utilization 
year ended december  cost of revenues salaries  payroll taxes and benefits   depreciation expense   cost of new equipment sold  book value of equipment sold   cost of retail parts sold  transportation   equipment repairs and maintenance   yard operating expenses   total cost of revenues   cost of revenues for the year ended december  was million  a increase from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues was of total revenue for the year ended december   relative to for the year ended december  the increase in cost of revenues resulted primarily from the items described below 
salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was a direct result of a salary reduction on certain operations managers which was implemented midway through  reduced hours  lower overtime  some headcount reduction and reduced bonus expense 
these decreases in salary  payroll tax and benefit expenses were partially offset by million of expenses incurred in the operations of coast crane during the post acquisition period 
depreciation expense related to rental equipment increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  million of the increase in depreciation expense is related to the coast crane equipment acquired in november cost of new equipment sold was million for the year ended december  and relates to new equipment cost of sales by our coast crane subsidiary acquired in november net book value of rental equipment sold decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net book value of equipment sold was primarily from a decrease in the number of cranes sold 
cost of retail parts sold was million for the year ended december  and relates to cost of retail parts sold by our coast crane subsidiary in the post acquisition operations of transportation expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was related to costs incurred from the post acquisition operations of coast crane in the remaining difference in transportation expenses incurred is due to differences in the combination of cranes and attachments rented and the specific distances that equipment had to move for various rentals 
equipment repairs and maintenance expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was related to cost incurred from the post acquisition operations of coast crane in yard operating expense decreased by to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the slight decrease was primarily related to lower average crane rental utilization 
essex crane s gain on the sale of used rental equipment was million margin  calculated by dividing the gain on the sale divided by the revenue from such sale for the year ended december  compared to million margin for the year ended december  the lower level of gains on sales was due to due to the lower level of used rental equipment sales in the current period

the effective tax rates were and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the company s effective rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to state and local taxes 
the decrease in the effective tax rate related to the increase in state deferred tax rates at essex crane as a result of the acquisition of coast crane and an additional state nol valuation allowance  which were partially offset by the reduction in unrecognized benefit associated with the effective settlement of uncertain tax positions 
the essex crane state deferred tax rates increased due to an increase in apportionment into higher tax rate states which coast crane operates due to unitary filing requirements 
the effective rate was lower than the statutory federal tax rate for the year ended december  due to tax return to provision differences  an increase in uncertain tax positions and state and local taxes including a change in estimate of million associated with the company s state income tax apportionments and rates 
essex had full time employees as of december  compared to full time employees at december  the increase in the number of employees is due to the acquisition of coast crane in november liquidity and capital resources the company has typically had substantial liquidity from its operating cash flows despite the significant downturn in the construction industry 
however  the company s significantly lower net cash flows from operations for the year ended december  are due primarily to a net loss of million and a decrease in deferred taxes 
combined net cash flows provided by operating activities of the company for all three years presented were approximately million 
as of december   the company had total debt obligations outstanding of approximately million and had an additional million available on our revolving credit facilities 
we believe that this availability for essex crane and coast crane along with million in cash  will provide sufficient liquidity through october and november  respectively 
we believe that the sources of cash from operations and the revolving credit facility should adequately fund the investment needs of the business for the foreseeable future

as of december  the purchase money security interest debt consists of the financing of five remaining pieces of equipment 
as the loans are amortizing  approximately million of the total million in principal payments are due prior to december  and as such  this amount is classified as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  monthly principal and interest payments are required through the various maturity dates ranging from september capitalized expenditures our capitalization criteria is to capitalize costs in the period they are incurred related to projects with total costs in excess of  when the projects extend the useful lives or enhance the crane s capabilities 
these capital projects are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
individual rental equipment items and property  plant and equipment items purchased with costs in excess of  are also capitalized and are depreciated over the useful life of the respective item purchased 
the following table provides quantitative information regarding the amount and types of costs capitalized during and for the years ended december  purchases of rental equipment   costs to prepare cranes for sale   purchases of property  plant equipment   capitalized crane repair costs   capitalized internally developed software costs  total capitalized expenditures   during the years ended december  and  we expensed repair and maintenance costs of approximately million and million  respectively 
we expect to capitalize costs of approximately million during the year ended december  approximately million of the total is for the purchase of rental equipment  a portion of which will be funded from proceeds from the sales of older and lighter lifting rental equipment

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the purposes of this document are based upon our audited consolidated audited financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results  however  may materially differ from the calculated estimates and this difference would be reported in its current operations 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
our significant accounting policies are presented in note to our audited financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the related notes thereto 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain accounting policies may be viewed as critical to us 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the financial statements and results of operations and that require our management s most subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
our management believes the policies that fall within this category are policies related to revenue recognition  rental equipment  impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  derivative financial instruments and income taxes 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including multiple element arrangements  in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance 
we generate revenue from the rental of cranes and related equipment and other services such as crane and equipment transportation and repairs and maintenance 
in many instances  the company provides some of the above services under the terms of a single customer equipment rental agreement 
the company also generates revenue from the retail sale of equipment and spare parts 
revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
the company is able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of selling price related to rental revenues after analysis of rental agreements absent any additional services offered by the company 
the company uses the estimated selling price for allocation of consideration to transportation services based on the costs associated with providing such services in addition to other supply and demand factors within specific sub markets 
the estimated selling prices of the individual deliverables are not materially different than the terms of the equipment rental agreements 
revenue from equipment rentals are billed monthly in advance and recognized as earned  on a straight line basis over the rental period specified in the associated equipment rental agreement 
rental contract terms span several months or longer 
because the term of the contracts can extend across financial reporting periods  when rentals are billed in advance  we defer recognition of revenue and record unearned rental revenue at the end of reporting periods so that rental revenue is included in the appropriate period 
repair service revenue is recognized when the service is provided 
transportation revenue from rental equipment delivery service is recognized for the drop off of rental equipment on the delivery date and is recognized for pick up when the equipment is returned to the essex crane service center  storage yard or next customer location 
new and used rental equipment and part sales are recognized upon acceptance by the customer and delivery has occurred 
there are estimates required in recording certain repair and maintenance revenues and also in recording any allowances for doubtful accounts 
the estimates have historically been accurate in all material respects and we do not anticipate any material changes to our current estimates in these areas 
useful lives of rental equipment essex s primary assets consist of its lattice boom crawler cranes and attachments  rough terrain cranes  tower cranes  boom trucks and other equipment within its fleet  which are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of essex crane and coast crane  essex recorded all of its crane and attachment and other construction equipment fleet values at fair value 
essex depreciates the existing fleet over periods between and years on a straight line basis such that additions of new cranes to the fleet are depreciated over a year time period while used cranes acquired will be amortized over a period of to years 
essex s management reviews the value of its crane fleet annually in conjunction with its lenders 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and credit memos 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of credit losses in accounts receivable and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company periodically reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts and balances are written off against the allowance when management believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  the company may be required to increase or decrease our allowance 
business combinations acquisition of coast crane s assets on november   the united states bankruptcy court for the western district of washington approved an asset purchase agreement the coast crane purchase agreement between cc bidding  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  and coast liquidating co  a delaware corporation  pursuant to which cc bidding agreed to purchase substantially all of the assets  including of the outstanding shares of capital stock of coast crane ltd  and assume certain liabilities of coast liquidating co 
coast liquidating co  a leading provider of specialty lifting solutions and crane rental services on the west coast of the united states  filed a voluntary petition for relief under the united states bankruptcy code on september  case number 
the coast acquisition was completed on november the primary reasons for coast acquisition are as follows broaden our product offerings to encourage customers to utilize our expanded product offerings for their heavy lifting construction equipment needs with an ability to leverage customer relationships between the operating subsidiaries while providing for cross selling opportunities  extend our geographic footprint to the western and northwestern us  alaska  hawaii  guam and the south pacific  provide new revenue streams from the distribution of new and used equipment  and providing after market support and parts and service 
this diversification results in a broader mix revenue streams  which we believe allow for more consistent earnings through economic cycles  and provide an opportunity for us to obtain a significant pool of rental equipment assets in one transaction as well as a highly trained workforce with significant construction equipment expertise 
the components of the total consideration transferred of million by cc bidding for the purchase of coast liquidating co 
s assets as shown below 
this includes settlement of certain liabilities in accordance with requirements under the bankruptcy proceedings

of million  to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is described below as follows the book value of other current assets  accounts payable and accrued liabilities were determined to approximate their fair value due to their short term nature  accounts receivables were recorded at their estimated fair values based on expected collectability 
the gross contractual receivables of accounts and other receivables as of the date of acquisition were approximately million 
managements best estimate of the gross accounts receivable not expected to be collected is million  management estimated the fair value of new and used equipment inventory based on recent sales prices  values of similar rental equipment assets and published market values  an experienced and qualified third party assisted in the valuation of coast liquidating co 
s rental equipment and titled vehicles included in property and equipment using the cost and market approaches based in part on assumptions provided by management  an experienced and qualified third party assisted in the valuation of intangible assets including customer relationship intangible and trademark and spare parts inventory using the income approach based in part on assumptions provided by management  and the remaining excess purchase price paid over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill all of which will be deductible for tax purposes over a year period 
goodwill includes the value of the assembled workforce and synergies created through the coast acquisition 
the following table contains the amounts of revenues and earnings of coast crane included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  for the period november  to december  total revenues  gross profit  loss from operations  net loss  income taxes the company uses an asset and liability approach  as required by the applicable accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those assets and liabilities are expected to be realized 
the effect on net deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the change in tax rates is enacted 
management makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to essex rental s tax provision in a subsequent period 
management assesses the likelihood that it will be able to recover its deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  the company will increase its provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that are unlikely to be recovered 
the company follows the applicable accounting guidance related to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the company files income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction and in most state jurisdictions 
the company is subject to us federal or state income tax examinations for years through and coast crane ltd is subject to canadian income tax examinations for the tax years through essex management makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax credits and in the calculation of the deferred income tax expense or benefit associated with certain deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to essex s tax provision in a subsequent period 
at december   the company had unused us federal net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million that begin expiring in at december   the company also had unused state net operating loss carry forwards totaling approximately million that expire between and impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value 
losses related to long lived assets are recorded where indicators of impairment are present and the estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset rental and associated revenues less related operating expenses plus any terminal value are less than the assets carrying value 
if the carrying value of the assets will not be recoverable  as determined by the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value of the assets is reduced to fair value 
essex  under the terms of its credit agreement  engages an independent third party to help management appraise the value of the crane and attachment fleet on at least an annual basis 
we consider a number of factors including value in use for crane and attachment rental  secondary market values and possible values in alternate use 
derivative financial instruments essex uses derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations on its revolving credit facility with the objective of converting a targeted amount of its floating rate debt to a fixed rate 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes  and therefore holds no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
essex believes that the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swaps is an important tool to manage its balance sheet liabilities and interest rate risk  while protecting its associated rental margins 
the company sets its equipment rental rates based in part as a percentage of the investment cost of the equipment and then uses the interest rate swap to lock in the associated interest costs of a period of time 
recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements please refer to note within our note to consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the fact that interest on our revolving credit facilities is calculated based upon either libor or prime rate plus an applicable margin as of december  for which we have an interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate at on million of the million of outstanding borrowings under essex crane s senior secured credit facility and three undesignated interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate at on million of the million of outstanding borrowings under coast crane s senior secured credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate in effect on all of the company s borrowings at december  was excluding the impact of the interest rate swaps and taking into consideration the swaps 
a increase in the effective interest rate on our total outstanding borrowings including our short term debt obligations not effectively fixed as a result of the interest rate swaps at december  would increase our interest expense by approximately million on an annualized basis 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
see also note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments 
the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their carrying values based on their nature and terms 
the fair value of the company s total debt outstanding as of december  was million  excluding the impact of our interest rate swaps 
if market rates of interest increased basis points due to a change in the applicable margin rate of interest a increase from the company s current margin the estimated fair value of the company s total debt obligations would be approximately million 
if market rates of interest decreased basis points due to a change in the applicable margin rate of interest a decrease from the company s current margin the estimated fair value of the company s total debt obligations would be approximately million 
the company s interest rate swaps had a liability fair value of approximately million as of december  if market rates of interest permanently increased by basis points  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap would result in a million liability 
if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap would be a million liability 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
theses analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in the overall economy that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  the company cannot predict its exposure to market risk 
consequently  further results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
