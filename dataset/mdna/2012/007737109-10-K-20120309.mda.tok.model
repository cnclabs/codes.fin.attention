item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company owns regional aircraft and engines  which are typically leased to customers under triple net operating leases 
the company defines an operating lease as a lease with a term that is less than the useful life of the asset 
a triple net operating lease is an operating lease under which  in addition to monthly rental payments  the lessee is generally responsible for the taxes  insurance and maintenance and repair of the aircraft arising from the use and operation of the aircraft during the term of the lease 
the acquisition of such equipment is generally made using debt financing 
the company s profitability and cash flow are dependent in large part upon its ability to acquire equipment  obtain and maintain favorable lease rates on such equipment  and re lease or sell equipment that comes off lease 
the company is subject to the credit risk of its lessees  both as to collection of rental payments and as to performance by lessees of their obligations to maintain the equipment 
since lease rates for assets in the company s portfolio generally decline as the assets age  the company s ability to maintain revenue and earnings is primarily dependent upon the company s ability to acquire and lease additional assets 
the company s primary uses of cash are for maintenance expense  purchase of aircraft and engines  debt service payments  management fees  insurance and professional fees 
the company s most significant non cash expenses include aircraft and engine depreciation and  in some years  impairment provisions  which are affected by significant estimates  and  through december   amortization of costs associated with the company s subordinated notes  which is included in interest expense 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company s operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in notes and to the financial statements 
the company believes that the most critical accounting policies include the following aircraft capitalization and depreciation  impairment of long lived assets  maintenance reserves and accrued costs  accounting for income taxes  and revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
a 
aircraft capitalization and depreciation the company s interests in aircraft and aircraft engines are recorded at cost  which includes acquisition costs 
since inception  the company has purchased only used aircraft and aircraft engines 
it is the company s policy to hold aircraft for approximately twelve years unless market conditions dictate otherwise 
therefore  depreciation on aircraft is initially computed using the straight line method over the twelve year period to an estimated residual value based on appraisal 
the company estimates the period over which it will hold aircraft engines based upon estimated usage  repair costs and other factors  and depreciates them to their appraised residual value over such period using the straight line method 
the amount of the depreciation expense recognized by the company during any accounting period with respect to a particular asset depends upon the estimated holding period over which such asset is depreciated 
the company periodically reviews plans for lease or sale of its aircraft and aircraft engines and changes  as appropriate  the remaining expected holding period for such assets 
estimated residual values are reviewed and adjusted periodically  based upon updated appraised residual estimates and the expected holding periods 
decreases in the market value of aircraft could affect not only the current value  discussed above  but also the estimated residual value 
a reduction in the estimated residual value of an asset results in an increase in the amount of depreciation expense recognized by the company during the remaining holding period of the asset 
b 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews assets for impairment when there has been an event or a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  the company routinely reviews all assets for impairment annually 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the future estimated undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset is expected to generate 
estimates are based on currently available market data and independent appraisals and are subject to fluctuation from time to time 
if these estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset at the time of evaluation  any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is determined by reference to independent appraisals and other factors considered relevant by management 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of future estimated undiscounted cash flows and  if different conditions prevail in the future  material write downs may occur 
no impairment provision was recorded in or c 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs maintenance costs under the company s triple net operating leases are typically the responsibility of the lessees  and the majority of the company s leases require the payment of monthly maintenance reserves 
maintenance reserves and accrued costs in the accompanying balance sheets include i refundable maintenance payments billed to lessees  which are paid out as related maintenance is performed or at the end of the lease  ii for lessees that pay non refundable maintenance reserves  estimated maintenance costs accrued at the time a reimbursement claim or sufficient information is received regarding maintenance work performed  and iii maintenance for work performed for off lease aircraft  which is not related to the release of reserves received from lessees 
non refundable maintenance reserves are reflected as revenue based on reported usage  if collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company uses the direct expense method  under which maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
maintenance reserves are determined by mutual agreement of the company and its lessee at inception of the lease and are based on the company s estimate of the total maintenance cost at some future point resulting from the lessee s usage 
reserve rates are typically subject to an annual adjustment provision that accounts for inflation of maintenance costs 
if a lessee is required to repair a component during the lease or perform a repair at lease end in order to comply with aircraft return conditions  it will be entitled to collect the reserves related to that repair from the company  and any excess costs would then be the responsibility of the lessee 
therefore  if maintenance rates do not accurately reflect the true cost of a repair  the company will not incur any financial impact 
if  however  the company repossesses an aircraft upon a lessee default  the company would incur expense for the entire cost of the maintenance 
if maintenance rates under a defaulted lease inaccurately reflect amounts less than the costs of the lessee s usage  such costs would be in excess of collected reserves 
it is also possible that  in order to remarket a repossessed aircraft  certain inspections and repairs may need to be performed earlier than otherwise required by the manufacturer or regulatory specifications 
in such a case  the collected reserves from the defaulted lessee  which were established assuming a normal interval between repairs  would likely be insufficient to cover the total cost incurred by the company 
in  several aircraft were returned to the company prior to their respective lease expirations 
the company incurred significant maintenance expense as a result of the returns  and  in some cases  the maintenance reserves retained by the company at the time of the returns were insufficient to cover the required maintenance 
d 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s current tax exposure under the most recent tax laws and assessing temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the balance sheet 
management must also assess the likelihood that the company s deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or changes the allowance in a period  the company reflects the corresponding increase or decrease in the tax provision in the statements of operations 
the company had no material unrecognized tax positions in or  and had valuation allowances of  in and in significant management judgment is required in estimating the company s future taxable income for purposes of assessing the company s ability to realize any benefit from its deferred taxes 
if actual taxable income is less than these estimates or if the company adjusts its estimates of future taxable income  the company may not realize any benefit from its deferred tax assets and its operating results and financial condition could be materially affected 
e 
revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from leasing of aircraft assets is recognized as operating lease revenue on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable lease agreements 
a receivable for deferred rent is recorded when the cash rent received is lower than the straight line revenue recognized 
such receivables decrease over the term of the applicable leases 
non refundable maintenance reserves billed to lessees are accrued as maintenance reserves revenue based on aircraft usage 
in instances where collectibility is not reasonably assured  the company recognizes revenue as cash payments are received 
the company estimates and charges to income a provision for bad debts based on its business experience and with each specific customer  the level of past due accounts  and its analysis of the lessee s overall financial condition 
if the financial condition of the company s customers deteriorates  it could result in actual losses exceeding the estimated allowances 
during  due to uncertainty about the collectibility of the related receivables  the company recorded a  bad debt allowance and recorded related reduced operating lease revenue of  reduced maintenance reserves revenue of  reduced maintenance reserves and accrued maintenance costs of  and increased maintenance expense of  results of operations the company s net income decreased by  in the year ended december  compared to  due primarily to decreased operating lease revenue and maintenance reserves revenue and increased maintenance  general and administrative expense and insurance expense  the aggregate effect of which was partially offset by decreased depreciation and interest expense and an increase in gain on disposal of assets 
operating lease revenue decreased by  in compared to  primarily because of i a  decrease related to aircraft that were on lease in but off lease for all or part of the period  ii a  decrease related to aircraft that were re leased during and at lower rates  iii a  decrease related to two aircraft for which the company recorded a bad debt allowance in  and iv a  decrease related to aircraft dispositions in and the effects of these reductions were partially offset by a  increase related to assets that were on lease in period but were off lease or subject to bad debt allowances for all or part of the same period of and to two aircraft that were acquired and leased in maintenance reserves revenue decreased by  in compared to  primarily as a result of lower average usage by some lessees in the period and the effect of off lease aircraft  as well as reduced maintenance reserves revenue from two aircraft for which the company recorded a revenue reserve in the period included maintenance reserves revenue of  related to refundable maintenance reserves retained by the company when two aircraft were repossessed in early such funds were used for maintenance required by the return conditions of the leases 
gain on disposal of assets increased by  in compared to during  the company recorded net gains on the sale of two aircraft and a net gain related to insurance proceeds for the loss of an aircraft 
during  the company recorded a net gain on insurance proceeds related to the loss of an aircraft  as well as gains on the sale of spare parts and of an engine that was replaced on one of the company s aircraft 
the company recognized  less in maintenance expense in than in  primarily as a result of a  decrease in maintenance performed by lessees using non refundable reserves  the effect of which was partially offset by a  increase in maintenance performed on off lease aircraft  as well as a  increase in amounts that were advanced on behalf of customers in connection with maintenance performed on the company s aircraft but for which repayment was not reasonably assured 
during and   and  respectively  of the company s maintenance expense for off lease aircraft and maintenance performed by lessees were funded by non refundable maintenance reserves that had been recorded as revenue when earned 
depreciation expense decreased by  in compared to  primarily due to changes in estimated residual values  which the company analyzes and adjusts periodically based on third party appraisals  the effect of which was partially offset by depreciation related to aircraft purchased in late and professional fees  general and administrative and other expenses increased by approximately  in compared to  as a result of higher legal and accounting expense and the forfeiture of a deposit when the company did not purchase an aircraft for which the company had previously executed a letter of intent 
insurance expense for off lease aircraft increased by  in compared to  primarily due to aircraft that were on lease in but off lease in in  a customer that leased two fokker aircraft and another customer that leased three fokker aircraft experienced severe financial difficulties  and all five aircraft were returned to the company 
the fokker lessee was a significant customer based on lease revenue 
the company retained the entire  of non refundable maintenance reserves from both customers that were previously recorded as maintenance reserves revenue 
the company has incurred significant maintenance expenses in order to prepare the five aircraft for lease to new customers 
approximately  and  of such costs were incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the two fokker aircraft were re leased to a new customer during liquidity and capital resources the company is currently financing its assets primarily through debt financing and excess cash flows 
a credit facility in april  the company s previous million credit facility was replaced with a new  two year million credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks  with union bank  na as agent 
in june  the credit facility was increased to million  with the addition of a new participant bank s commitment of million 
in march  the credit facility was extended for one year  to april   on terms similar to the original agreement 
the credit facility is secured by all of the assets of the company  including its aircraft and engine portfolio 
during  the company borrowed  and repaid  as of september   the company was out of compliance with a financial ratio covenant of the credit facility  but was granted a waiver of compliance with this covenant by the credit facility banks  applicable to the september  calculation 
as of december  and  the company was in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility agreement 
although the company believes it will continue to be in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants in  there can be no assurance of such compliance 
any default under the credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could result in foreclosure upon any or all of the existing assets of the company 
as of march   the company had an outstanding balance of  under the credit facility 
although the total maximum credit under the credit facility is currently  exclusion of certain assets from the collateral base has decreased the available credit to  the company s interest expense will generally increase and decrease with prevailing interest rates 
the company has the ability to enter into interest rate swaps to economically hedge against interest rate increases in its floating rate debt under the credit facility 
the company has done so in the past and may do so in the future 
b senior unsecured subordinated debt in april  the company entered into a securities purchase agreement the subordinated notes agreement  whereby the company would issue subordinated notes  with an aggregate principal amount of million to certain note purchasers 
in july  the company and the holders of subordinated notes agreed to amend the subordinated notes agreement to reduce the maximum amount of subordinated notes to be issued from million to million 
during and  the company repaid  and  respectively  of principal under the subordinated notes 
the final amortizing payment was made on december  the purchasers of the subordinated notes hold warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable for a four year period that commenced at the maturity of the subordinated notes on december  pursuant to an investors rights agreement  the warrants are subject to registration rights that require the company to use commercially reasonable efforts to register the shares issued upon exercise of the warrants on a registration statement filed with the sec 
c cash flow the company s primary sources of cash are i operating lease revenue and ii maintenance reserves billed monthly to lessees based on aircraft usage 
cash collected by the company for maintenance reserves is not required by the leases to be segregated and is included in cash and cash equivalents on the company s balance sheets 
the company s primary uses of cash are for maintenance expense  management fees  professional fees  insurance  purchase of aircraft and engines  credit facility interest payments and  through  principal and interest payments due for the company s subordinated notes  which were repaid in full on december  the amount of interest paid by the company depends on the outstanding balance of its credit facility  which carries a floating interest rate as well as an interest rate margin  and is therefore also dependent on changes in prevailing interest rates 
the timing and amount of the company s payments for maintenance vary  depending on the timing of lessee performed maintenance that is eligible for reimbursement  the aggregate amount of such claims and the timing and amount of maintenance incurred in connection with preparation of off lease assets for re lease to new customers 
the company s maintenance payments constitute a large portion of its cash needs  and the company may from time to time borrow additional funds under the credit facility to provide funding for such payments 
management believes that the company will have adequate cash flow to meet its ongoing operational needs  including required repayments under the credit facility  based upon its estimates of future revenues and expenditures  which include assumptions regarding i revenues for assets to be re leased  ii required debt payments  iii interest rates  iv the cost and anticipated timing of maintenance to be performed and v timely use of proceeds of unused debt capacity toward additional acquisitions of income producing assets 
although the company believes that the assumptions it has made in forecasting its cash flow are reasonable in light of experience  actual results could deviate from such assumptions 
among the more significant factors that could have an impact on the accuracy of cash flow assumptions are i lessee non performance or non compliance with lease obligations  ii inability to locate new lessees for returned equipment within a reasonable remarketing period  or at a rent level consistent with projected rental rates for the asset  iii lessee performance of maintenance  and payment of related maintenance claims  earlier than anticipated  iv inability to locate and acquire a sufficient volume of additional assets at prices that will produce acceptable net returns  v an increase in interest rates and vi any one or a combination of the above factors that causes the company to violate covenants of the credit facility agreement  which may in turn require repayment of some or all of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
i operating activities the company s cash flow from operations decreased by  in compared to as discussed below  the change in cash flow was primarily a result of decreases in payments received for rent and security deposits and an increase in payments for aircraft insurance  the effects of which were partially offset by decreases in expenditures for maintenance  interest  and professional fees and general and administrative expenses 
payments for operating lease revenue and security deposits several assets that were on lease in were off lease for all or part of in addition  the lessee for two of the company s aircraft was in arrears in its obligations to the company at the end of as a result  payments received from lessees for rent decreased by  in compared to the company currently is receiving no lease revenue for its off lease assets  comprised of three fokker and one saab b aircraft 
the company received  less for security deposits in compared to the decrease was primarily due to funds received when the company drew on a letter of credit that served as security for two aircraft leases that were terminated in early as a result of the lessee s bankruptcy 
the security deposit was used to partially fund maintenance required by the return conditions of the leases 
payments for maintenance payments for maintenance decreased by  in compared to as a result of a decrease in maintenance on off lease aircraft  as well as a decrease in amounts reimbursed to lessees for maintenance reserves claims 
the amount of payments for maintenance in future periods will depend on the amount and timing of maintenance paid as reimbursement to lessees for maintenance reserves claims  which are dependent upon utilization and required maintenance intervals  and maintenance paid for off lease assets 
payments for interest payments for interest decreased by  in  compared to  primarily as a result of i a lower average subordinated notes balance as a result of repayments and ii the use of longer term libor financing for a portion of the company s credit facility indebtedness in the fourth quarter of  for which interest was accrued but was not payable until the loans matured in january payments for professional fees  general and administrative expenses and aircraft insurance payments for professional fees and general and administrative expenses decreased by  in compared to  primarily as a result of lower expenditures for legal costs in related to the company s credit facility  which commenced in payments for aircraft insurance increased by  in compared to because more of the company s aircraft were off lease in ii investing activities during  the company received cash of  from the sale of two aircraft and  from the collection of insurance proceeds for the loss of an aircraft 
the company used cash of  for the purchase of two aircraft and for equipment that was installed on several aircraft and for acquisition costs related to an aircraft purchased in december  as well as for an engine maintenance contract related to the company s bombardier dash q  which was purchased in december and leased in august during  the company received cash of  from the collection of insurance proceeds for i an aircraft that was damaged and declared a total loss in january and ii an engine that was damaged in late during  the company used cash of  for the purchase of an aircraft  equipment that was installed on several aircraft and for acquisition costs related to aircraft engines purchased in the fourth quarter of iii financing activities the company borrowed  and  under the credit facility during and  respectively 
the company repaid  and  of its total outstanding debt in and  respectively 
such payments were funded by excess cash flow 
outlook a general the recent global downturn resulted in a significant reduction in airline passenger volume and  in reaction to that  a reduction in the number of aircraft and aircraft engines needed for operation by carriers in nearly all geographic areas  especially europe 
the slow recovery from this downturn and the current european financial crisis have created a challenging environment for the company in three respects the global economic situation has increased the possibility of an unanticipated lessee default  particularly by the company s less established carriers 
a lessee s default and the unscheduled return of an asset to the company for remarketing could result not only in reduced operating lease revenue but also in unanticipated  unrecoverable expenses arising from the lessee s default on its maintenance and return condition obligations 
the company monitors the performance of all of its customers and continues to note indications of weakened financial conditions and operating results for the majority of its customers 
the reduction in demand for aircraft and aircraft engines has increased the possibility that the company s current lessees will choose to return leased assets at lease expiration rather than renew the existing leases  notwithstanding that any such lessee may incur significant expenses to satisfy return conditions 
due to decreased demand for aircraft capacity  it is likely that the company will experience lower on lease utilization rates and longer lead times for remarketing of returned assets  as well as lower rental rates for remarketed assets  as was the case with several lease extensions and re leases in and this trend is expected to continue to affect the company s operating revenue in finally  the downturn also has created fewer opportunities for acquisitions for the company 
the company s customers are generally carriers needing additional aircraft to expand their route systems or increase frequencies 
in the current environment of reduced demand for air travel and consequently reduced capacity by carriers  there is likely to be a significant decrease in the pool of such customers requiring aircraft 
therefore  it is possible that the company s portfolio growth will continue to be slow  as fewer carriers seek to expand their fleets 
b remarketing efforts i assets currently off lease as of march   the company is seeking release opportunities for the following of its assets that are off lease three fokker aircraft  which were returned to the company prior to lease expiration in  and one saab b aircraft  which was returned at lease expiration in march the company has incurred significant maintenance expenses in order to prepare its off lease assets for lease to new customers 
although the company believes it has incurred the majority of such expenses  it is possible that additional maintenance expenses will be incurred when new customers are identified for the company s remaining off lease assets 
the amount of such maintenance could exceed the amount of reserves previously collected for the assets 
ii upcoming lease expirations unless they are renewed  leases for four of the company s assets will expire in the first half of the customers for two of the assets have indicated their intent to extend the applicable leases 
c credit facility the company believes that the availability under the credit facility should be sufficient to fund its anticipated asset acquisitions through the end of the term of the current credit facility will expire in april  and the company anticipates will need to negotiate an extension or a replacement of the credit facility by that date 
although the company believes it will be in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility in  as discussed below in factors that may affect future results credit facility obligations  there can be no assurance of such compliance 
any default under the credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could result in foreclosure upon any or all of the existing assets of the company 
d deferral agreements beginning in  the company granted deferral of certain overdue and or future rental or reserves payment obligations pursuant to agreements with certain customers that had experienced financial difficulties 
the company currently has no deferral agreement balances outstanding 
one of the company s customers  with which the company previously had a deferral agreement  has made timely payments to the company since august following a change in management 
at december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of  for the amounts owed by that customer in excess of the security deposits held by the company 
in january  the company and that customer signed a memorandum of understanding regarding the arrearages owed to the company 
the memorandum of understanding calls for of the arrearages to be paid over time  with the remaining forgiven by the company upon receipt of all arrearage payments 
although beginning in the company agreed with several lessees to defer certain payments  based on its evaluation of its current customers  the company does not anticipate any trend developing that will result in additional deferral agreements in factors that may affect future results credit facility obligations 
the total amount of borrowing under the credit facility is limited to a percentage of the collateral base  and assets that come off lease and remain off lease for a period of time may reduce the collateral base 
past due lease payments may also affect an asset s eligibility for inclusion in the collateral base  and the credit facility agreement places certain limits on the use of deferral agreements to mitigate such arrearages for purposes of inclusion of the subject asset in the collateral base 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash funds to make any required principal repayment that arises due to any such collateral base limitations 
at september   the company was out of compliance with one of its financial ratio covenants  but received a waiver from its lenders for such non compliance 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at the december  measurement date 
although the company believes  based in part on certain assumptions discussed below  that it will continue to be in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility  there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will be correct  and if not  the company will need to seek further waivers from its lenders 
any default under the credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could result in foreclosure upon any or all of the existing assets of the company 
the company s beliefs regarding compliance with its credit facility covenants are based on certain assumptions regarding the timing of the incurrence of maintenance expense  remarketing of off lease assets within the time period anticipated by the company  certain lease renewals  interest rate levels  the company s profitability  lessee defaults or bankruptcies  and certain other matters that the company deems reasonable in light of its experience in the industry see liquidity and capital resources cash flow  above 
there can be no assurance that the company s assumptions will prove to be correct 
if the assumptions are incorrect for example  if the company s off lease aircraft are not re leased in the time period currently anticipated by the company as described in outlook c credit facility and the company has not obtained an applicable waiver or amendment of applicable covenants from its lenders to mitigate the situation  the company may have to sell a significant portion of its portfolio in order to avoid or cure a default under the credit facility agreement 
risks of debt financing 
the company s use of debt as the primary form of acquisition financing subjects the company to increased risks associated with leveraging 
indebtedness owed under the credit facility carries a higher cost of capital relative to equity financing  resulting in relatively higher expense and reduced free cash flow 
the company s assets secure its debt financing 
in addition to payment obligations  the credit facility also requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants  including a requirement of positive earnings and compliance with interest coverage ratios and required net worth 
any default under the credit facility  if not waived by the lenders  could result in foreclosure upon any or all of the existing assets of the company 
in addition  the term of the current credit facility will expire in april  and the company will need to negotiate an extension or a replacement of the credit facility by that date  and there can be no assurance of any such extension or replacement 
general economic conditions and lowered demand for travel 
the company s business is dependent upon general economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the industry is continuing to experience financial difficulty and contraction due to the protracted downturn in the global economy 
passenger volume has fallen significantly for carriers  and the loss of revenue has affected many carriers financial condition 
the ongoing credit crisis has made it difficult or impossible for many regional carriers to find the additional debt financing on which they have traditionally relied 
the confluence of these economic factors increases the likelihood of failures among the company s customers 
the spread of a disease epidemic  the threat or execution of a terrorist attack against aviation  a worsening financial bank crisis in europe  a natural event that interrupts air traffic such as the iceland volcano eruption  political crises or other events that cause a prolonged spike in fuel prices  or other like events could exacerbate an already weakened condition and lead to widespread failures in the air carrier industry 
if lessees experience financial difficulties and are unable to meet lease obligations  this will  in turn  negatively affect the company s financial performance 
during the current period of economic contraction  many airlines have reduced capacity in response to lower passenger loads  and as a result  there has been reduced demand for aircraft and aircraft engines and a corresponding decrease in market lease rental rates and aircraft values for many aircraft types 
this reduced market value could affect the company s results if the market value of an asset or assets in the company s portfolio falls below carrying value  and the company determines that a write down of the value on its balance sheet is appropriate 
furthermore  if older  expiring leases are replaced with leases at decreased lease rates  the lease revenue from the company s existing portfolio is likely to decline  with the magnitude of the decline dependent on the length of the downturn and the depth of the decline in market rents 
economic downturns can affect certain regions of the world more than others 
as the company s portfolio is not entirely globally diversified  a localized downturn in one of the key regions in which the company leases assets could have a significant adverse impact on the company 
currently     and of the company s lease revenue comes from the european  caribbean  asian  african and north american regions  respectively  with  with six  two  two  three and four lessees  respectively 
therefore  europe is currently the most significant market to the company and a regional downturn that affects the financial health of european regional carriers could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
in that respect  the current european financial crisis and its potential impact on the european economy is a substantial area of concern for the company 
over the last few years  several of the company s customers have experienced financial difficulties arising from a combination of the weakened air carrier market and their own unique financial circumstances and have requested and been granted deferral of certain overdue and or future rental or reserve payment obligations 
if the current weakened air carrier environment continues  it is possible that the company may enter into additional deferral agreements 
when a customer requests a deferral of lease obligations  the company evaluates the lessee s financial plan  the likelihood that the lessee can remain a viable carrier  and whether the deferral will be repaid according to the agreed schedule 
if the company feels that there is a risk that deferred obligations will not be repaid  the company records the rent and reserve payments from the applicable lessee on a cash basis 
if the company makes a judgment that the lessee is likely to meet its deferred obligations  the company continues to record the deferred rental and reserve payments as revenue in the periods in which they accrue 
it is possible that a lessee that the company judges to be likely to repay its deferred obligations could experience a worsening financial condition 
in that circumstance  the company may determine that full repayment of the deferred obligations is no longer likely  in which case the company would record a bad debt expense or reduction of income 
this could have a material effect on the company s financial results in the period that such bad debt expense or income reduction is recorded 
availability of financing 
the company believes that the availability of financing under the credit facility will be sufficient to fund projected acquisitions through the end of the credit facility term was recently extended for one year to april the company will either need to negotiate a longer term facility with the current syndicate of lenders or a replacement group within the coming year  or seek another short term extension of the current credit facility on its existing terms 
in the longer term  however  the company s continued growth will depend on its ability to obtain capital  either through debt or equity financings 
the financial markets have experienced significant setbacks that have made access to capital more costly and difficult 
as a result  commercial lending origination has dramatically decreased  and asset based debt financing remains difficult to obtain 
there is no assurance that the company will succeed in finding additional funding  and if such financing is found  it may be on terms less favorable than the company s current debt financings 
ownership risks 
nearly all of the company s portfolio is leased under operating leases 
the term of a lease is typically less than the entire anticipated remaining useful life of the leased asset 
the company s ability to recover its purchase investment in an asset subject to such a lease is dependent upon the company s ability to profitably re lease or sell the asset after the expiration of the initial lease term 
some of the factors that have an impact on the company s ability to re lease or sell the asset include worldwide economic conditions  general aircraft market conditions  regulatory changes that may make an asset s use more expensive or preclude use unless the asset is modified  changes in the supply or cost of aircraft equipment and technological developments that cause the asset to become obsolete 
if the company is unable to remarket its assets on favorable terms when the leases for such assets expire  the company s business  financial condition  cash flow  ability to service debt and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  a successful investment in an asset subject to a lease depends in part upon having the asset returned by the lessee in the condition as required under the lease 
each lease typically obligates a customer to return an asset to the company in a specified condition  which generally requires it be returned in equal or better condition than at delivery to the lessee 
if the lessee becomes insolvent during the term of its lease and the company has to repossess the asset from the lessee  it is unlikely that the lessee will have the financial ability to meet these return obligations and it is likely that the company would be required to expend funds in excess of the maintenance reserves collected to return the asset to a remarketable condition 
several of the company s leases do not require payment of monthly maintenance reserves  which serve as the lessee s advance payment for its future repair and maintenance obligations 
if repossession due to lessee default occurs under such a lease  the company will be left with the expense for the costs of unperformed repair and maintenance under the applicable lease and the company may incur an unanticipated expense in order to re lease the asset 
furthermore  the occurrence of unexpected adverse changes that impact the company s estimates of expected cash flows generated from an asset may result in an asset impairment charge against the company s earnings 
the company periodically reviews long term assets for impairment  in particular  when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is estimated to be not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the company may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of a prolonged weak economic environment  challenging market conditions in the airline industry or events related to particular lessees  assets or asset types 
lessee credit risk 
the company carefully evaluates the credit risk of each customer and attempts to obtain a third party guaranty  letters of credit or other credit enhancements  if it deems them necessary in addition to customary security deposits 
there can be no assurance  however  that such enhancements will be available  or that  if obtained  will fully protect the company from losses resulting from a lessee default or bankruptcy 
if a lessee that is a certified us airline were in default under a lease and sought protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code  section of the bankruptcy code would automatically prevent the company from exercising any remedies against such lessee for a period of days 
after the day period had passed  the lessee would have to agree to perform the lease obligations and cure any defaults  or the company would have the right to repossess the equipment 
this procedure under the bankruptcy code has been subject to significant litigation  however  and it is possible that the company s enforcement rights may be further adversely affected by a declaration of bankruptcy by a defaulting lessee 
most of the company s current and expected growth is expected outside of the united states  and non us lessees are not subject to non us bankruptcy laws  although there may be debtor protection similar to us bankruptcy laws available in some jurisdictions 
in any event  collection and enforcement may be more difficult and complicated in foreign countries 
since  the company has seen indications of a weakening in both the financial condition and operating results of the majority of its customers  and several of the company s customers have experienced financial difficulties 
the company closely monitors the performance of all of its lessees 
if any of the company s current or future lessees becomes unable to meet their lease obligations  the company s future results could be materially and adversely impacted 
concentration of lessees and aircraft type 
for the month ended february   based on monthly operating lease revenue and interest income from finance leases  the company s three largest customers were located in antigua  germany and norway and accounted for a total of approximately of the company s monthly lease revenue 
a lease default by or collection problem with one or a combination of any of these significant customers could have a disproportionate negative impact on the company s financial results and collateral base under the credit facility  and  therefore  the company s operating results are especially sensitive to any negative developments with respect to these customers in terms of lease compliance or collection 
such concentration of lessee credit risk decreases as the company leases additional assets to new lessees 
as of february   the company owned seven fokker  nine bombardier dash and fourteen fokker aircraft  making these three aircraft types the dominant types in the portfolio and representing  and  respectively  of net book value 
as a result  a change in the desirability and availability of any of these types of aircraft  which would in turn affect valuations of such aircraft  would have a disproportionately significant impact on the company s portfolio value 
such aircraft type concentration will diminish if the company acquires additional assets of other types 
conversely  acquisition of these types of aircraft will increase the company s risks related to its concentration of those aircraft types 
risks related to regional air carriers 
the company s continued focus on its customer base of regional air carriers subjects the company to additional risks 
some of the lessees in the regional air carrier market are companies that are start up  low capital  and or low margin operators 
often  the success of such carriers depends on contractual arrangements with major trunk carriers or franchises from governmental agencies that provide subsidies for operating essential air routes  both of which may be subject to termination or cancellation with short notice periods 
investment in new aircraft types and engines 
the company intends to continue to focus solely on regional aircraft and engines 
although the company has traditionally invested in a limited number of types of turboprop aircraft and engines  the company has also acquired several fokker regional jet aircraft and regional jet aircraft engines  and may continue to seek acquisition opportunities for new types and models of regional jet and turboprop aircraft and engines used in the company s targeted customer base of regional air carriers 
acquisition of aircraft types and engines not previously acquired by the company entails greater ownership risk due to the company s lack of experience managing those aircraft and engine types 
the company believes  however  that the overall industry experience of jmc s personnel and its technical resources should permit the company to effectively manage such new aircraft types and engines 
further  the broadening of the asset types in the aircraft portfolio may have a benefit of diversifying the company s portfolio see factors that may affect future results concentration of lessees and aircraft type  above 
leasing risks 
the company s successful negotiation of lease extensions  re leases and sales is critical to achieving its financial objectives and involves a number of risks 
demand for lease or purchase of the assets depends on the economic condition of the airline industry  which is  in turn  sensitive to general economic conditions 
the ability to re lease equipment at acceptable rates may depend on the demand and market values at the time of remarketing 
the company acquires used aircraft equipment 
the market for used aircraft equipment has been cyclical  and generally reflects economic conditions and the strength of the travel and transportation industry 
the demand for and value of many types of used aircraft in the recent past has been depressed by such factors as airline financial difficulties  increased fuel costs  the number of new aircraft on order and the number of aircraft coming off lease 
values may also increase for certain aircraft types that become desirable based on market conditions and changing airline capacity 
if the company were to purchase an aircraft during a period of increasing values  it would in turn need to lease such aircraft at a corresponding higher lease rate to compensate for its higher purchase price 
engine leasing risk 
the company currently has three engines in its portfolio  making up of the company s total aircraft and aircraft engines net book value 
the company may from time to time lease one or more of these engines under industry standard short term engine leases  which place the risk of an engine failure not caused by lessee negligence or foreign object damage upon the lessor 
it is not economically practicable for an engine lessor to insure against that risk 
if an engine failure occurs and is not covered by a manufacturer s warranty or caused by circumstances that under its lease the lessee is required to cover  the company s investment in the engine could be a significant loss 
interest rate risk 
the credit facility carries a floating interest rate based upon short term interest rate indices 
lease rates typically  but not always  move over time with interest rates  but market demand and numerous other asset specific factors also affect lease rates 
because the company s typical lease rates are fixed at the origination of leases  interest rate changes during the term of a lease have no effect on existing lease rental payments 
therefore  if interest rates rise significantly and there is relatively little lease origination by the company following such rate increases  the company could experience decreased net income as additional interest expense outpaces revenue growth 
further  even if significant lease origination occurs following such rate increases  other contemporaneous aircraft market forces may result in lower or flat rental rates  thereby decreasing net income 
international risks 
the company leases assets primarily in overseas markets 
leases with foreign lessees  however  may present different risks than those with domestic lessees 
foreign laws  regulations and judicial procedures may be more or less protective of lessor rights than those that apply in the united states 
the company could experience collection or repossession problems related to the enforcement of its lease agreements under foreign local laws and remedies in foreign jurisdictions 
the protections potentially offered by section of the bankruptcy code do not apply to non us carriers  and applicable local law may not offer similar protections 
certain countries do not have a central registration or recording system with which to locally establish the company s interest in equipment and related leases 
this could make it more difficult for the company to recover an aircraft in the event of a default by a foreign lessee 
a lease with a foreign lessee is subject to risks related to the economy of the country or region in which such lessee is located  which may be weaker than the us economy 
an economic downturn in a particular country or region may impact a foreign lessee s ability to make lease payments  even if the us and other foreign economies remain stable 
in addition  foreign lessees are subject to risks related to currency conversion fluctuations 
although the company s current leases are all payable in us dollars  the company may agree in the future to leases that permit payment in foreign currency  which would subject such lease revenue to monetary risk due to currency fluctuations 
in addition  if the company undertakes certain obligations under a lease to contribute to a repair or improvement and if the work is performed in a foreign jurisdiction and paid for in foreign currency  currency fluctuations causing a weaker dollar between the time such agreement is made and the time payment for the work is made may result in an unanticipated increase in us dollar denominated cost for the company 
even with us dollar denominated lease payment provisions  the company could still be affected by a devaluation of the lessee s local currency that would make it more difficult for a lessee to meet its us dollar denominated payments  increasing the risk of default of that lessee  particularly if its revenue is primarily derived in the local currency 
foreign lessees that operate internationally may also face restrictions on repatriating foreign revenue to their home country 
this could create a cash flow crisis for an otherwise profitable carrier  affecting its ability to meet its lease obligations 
finally  ownership of a leased asset operating in a foreign country and or by a foreign carrier may subject the company to additional tax liabilities that are not present with aircraft operated in the united states 
depending on the jurisdiction  laws governing such tax liabilities may be complex  not well formed or not uniformly enforced 
in such jurisdictions  the company may decide to take an uncertain tax position based on the best advice of the local tax experts it engages  which position may be challenged by the taxing authority 
if the taxing authority later assesses a liability  the company may be required to pay penalties and interest on the assessed amount  which penalties and interest would not give rise to a corresponding foreign tax credit on the company s us tax return 
reliance on jmc 
all management of the company is performed by jmc under a management agreement between the company and jmc  which is in the fifteenth year of a year term and provides for an asset based management fee 
jmc is not a fiduciary to the company or its stockholders 
the company s board of directors the board has ultimate control and supervisory responsibility over all aspects of the company and owes fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
the board has no control over the internal operations of jmc  but the board does have the ability and responsibility to manage the company s relationship with jmc and the performance of jmc s obligations to the company under the management agreement  as it would have for any third party service provider to the company 
while jmc may not owe any fiduciary duties to the company by virtue of the management agreement  all of the officers of jmc are also officers of the company  and in that capacity owe fiduciary duties to the company and its stockholders 
in addition  certain officers of the company hold significant ownership positions in the company and jhc  the parent company of jmc 
the management agreement may be terminated if jmc defaults on its obligations to the company 
however  the agreement provides for liquidated damages in the event of its wrongful termination by the company 
certain directors of the company are also directors of jmc and  as discussed above  the officers of the company are also officers of jmc and certain officers hold significant ownership positions in both the company and jhc  the holding company for jmc 
consequently  the directors and officers of jmc may have a conflict of interest in the event of a dispute between the company and jmc 
although the company has taken steps to prevent conflicts of interest arising from such dual roles  such conflicts may still occur 
jmc has acted as the management company for two other aircraft portfolio owners  jetfleet iii  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds  and aerocentury iv  inc aerocentury iv  which raised approximately  in bond issuance proceeds 
in the first quarter of  aerocentury iv defaulted on certain bond obligations 
in june  the indenture trustee for aerocentury iv s bondholders repossessed aerocentury iv s assets and took over management of aerocentury iv s remaining assets 
jetfleet iii defaulted on its bond obligation of  in may the indenture trustee for jetfleet iii bondholders repossessed jetfleet iii s unsold assets in late may management fee structure 
all decisions regarding acquisitions and disposal of aircraft from the company s portfolio are made by jmc 
jmc is paid a management fee based on the net asset value of the company s portfolio 
it may also receive a one time asset acquisition fee upon purchase of an asset by the company  and a one time remarketing fee in connection with the sale or re lease of an asset 
optimization of the results of the company depends on timing of the acquisition  lease yield on the acquired assets  and re lease or sale of its portfolio assets 
under the current management fee structure  a larger volume of acquisitions generates acquisition fees and also increases the periodic management fee by increasing the size of the aircraft portfolio 
since the company s current business strategy involves continued growth of its portfolio and a buy and hold strategy  a compensation structure that results in greater compensation with an increased portfolio size is not inherently inconsistent with that strategy 
the compensation structure does  nonetheless  create a situation where a decision by jmc for the company to forego an asset transaction deemed to be an unacceptable business risk due to the lessee or the aircraft type is in conflict with jmc s own pecuniary interest 
as a result  the compensation structure could act to incent greater risk taking by jmc in asset acquisition decision making 
all acquisition decisions by jmc on behalf of the company  however  currently require credit facility lender approval of the asset acquired and the lessee in order to be included in the credit facility collateral base  and the company has established objective target guidelines for yields on acquired assets 
further  the company s board  including a majority of the outside independent directors  must approve any acquisition that involves a new asset type 
while the company currently believes the foregoing are effective mitigating factors against undue compensation incented risk taking by jmc  there is no assurance that such mechanisms can entirely and effectively eliminate such risk 
government regulation 
there are a number of areas in which government regulation may result in costs to the company 
these include aircraft registration  safety requirements  required equipment modifications and aircraft noise requirements 
although it is contemplated that the burden and cost of complying with such requirements will fall primarily upon lessees of equipment  there can be no assurance that the cost will not fall on the company 
furthermore  future government regulations could cause the value of any non complying equipment owned by the company to decline substantially 
competition 
the aircraft leasing industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with aircraft manufacturers  distributors  airlines and other operators  equipment managers  leasing companies  equipment leasing programs  financial institutions and other parties engaged in leasing  managing or remarketing aircraft  many of which have significantly greater financial resources 
nevertheless  the company believes that it is competitive because of jmc s experience and operational efficiency in identifying and obtaining financing for the transaction types desired by regional air carriers 
this market segment  which is characterized by transaction sizes of less than million and in many cases privately held customers without well established third party credit ratings  is not well served by the company s larger competitors 
jmc has developed a reputation as a global participant in this segment of the market  and the company believes that jmc s reputation benefits the company 
there is  however  no assurance that competition from larger aircraft leasing companies will not increase significantly or that jmc s reputation will continue to be strong in this market segment 
casualties  insurance coverage 
the company  as owner of transportation equipment  may be named in a suit claiming damages for injuries or damage to property caused by its assets 
as a triple net lessor  the company is generally protected against such claims  since the lessee would be responsible for  insure against and indemnify the company for such claims 
the company defines an operating lease as a lease with a term that is less than the useful life of the asset 
a triple net operating lease is an operating lease under which  in addition to monthly rental payments  the lessee is generally responsible for the taxes  insurance and maintenance and repair of the aircraft arising from the use and operation of the aircraft during the term of the lease 
although the united states aviation act may provide some protection with respect to the company s aircraft assets  it is unclear to what extent such statutory protection would be available to the company with respect to most of the company s assets  which are operated in foreign countries where such provisions of the united states aviation act may not apply 
the company s leases generally require a lessee to insure against likely risks of loss or damage to the leased asset  and liability to passengers and third parties pursuant to industry standard insurance policies and require lessees to provide insurance certificates documenting the policy periods and coverage amounts 
the company tracks receipt of the certificates and calendars their expiration dates 
prior to the expiration of an insurance certificate  if a replacement certificate has not been received  the company reminds the lessee of its obligation to provide current insurance certificates 
despite these requirements and procedures  there may be certain cases where the loss is not entirely covered by the lessee or its insurance 
the possibility of such an event is remote  but any such uninsured loss with respect to the equipment or insured loss for which insurance proceeds are inadequate might result in a loss of invested capital in and any profits anticipated from  such equipment  as well as a potential claim directly against the company 
compliance with future environmental regulations 
compliance with future environmental regulations may harm the company s business 
many aspects of aircraft operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental regulations  and growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition by the u 
s and foreign governments of additional regulation of carbon emissions  aimed at either requiring adoption of technology to reduce the amount of carbon emissions or putting in place a fee or tax system on carbon emitters 
it is likely that any such regulation will be directed at the company s customers  as operators of aircraft  or at the company  as owners of aircraft 
under the company s triple net arrangements  the company would likely shift responsibility for compliance to its lessees  but there might be some costs of regulation that the company could not shift and would itself have to bear 
although it is not expected that the costs of complying with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  no assurance can be given that the costs of complying with environmental regulations adopted in the future will not have such an effect 
cyber security risks 
the company believes that it has sufficient cyber security measures in place commensurate with the risks to the company of a successful cyber attack or breach of security 
the company s main vulnerability to a cyber attack would be interruption of the company s email communications internally and with third parties  and loss of document sharing between the company s offices and remote workers 
such an attack could temporarily impede the efficiency of the company s operations  however  the company believes that sufficient replacement mechanisms exist in the event of such an interruption that there would not be a material adverse financial impact on the company s business 
warrant issuance 
as part of the subordinated notes financing  warrants were issued to the holders of subordinated notes to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock that are currently exercisable and represent approximately of the post exercise fully diluted capitalization of the company 
the exercise price under the warrants is per share 
if the warrants to purchase shares are exercised at a time when the exercise price is less than the fair market value of the company s common stock  there will be dilution to the existing holders of common stock 
this dilution of the company s common stock could depress its trading price 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock may be subject to fluctuations following developments relating to the company s operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy  the financial markets  the airline industry  changes in accounting principles or tax laws applicable to the company or its lessees  or other developments affecting the company  its customers or its competitors  or arising from other investor sentiment unknown to the company 
because the company has a relatively small capitalization of approximately million shares outstanding  there is a correspondingly limited amount of trading and float of the company s shares 
consequently  the company s stock price is more sensitive to a single large trade or a small number of simultaneous trades along the same trend than a company with larger capitalization and higher trading volume and float
