hooper holmes made significant capital investments and operating improvements in that we believe are transforming the way we deliver services  improving our competitive position and will enable profitable growth in these investments and improvements include the following we have promoted and hired new field sales managers and grown our field sales force by almost  this expansion is strengthening our presence with local agents and brokers and is significantly improving our coverage of local geographic markets 
we introduced new field sales and regional operations incentive compensation plans and performance measurement systems 
these tools are beginning to drive increased order volume in local markets and enable real time sales management and performance 
we initiated a more targeted and continuous sales training program 
this program is helping our sales force sell more effectively by differentiating our full portfolio of services including paramedical exams  instant scheduling  managed scheduling  iparamed e exams  lab testing and tele underwriting 
we completed development of our new portamedic web portal 
the portal will make it easier for our customers and their agents and brokers to order our services and to stay abreast of each step in our order fulfillment process 
we began deployment of this new website in the fourth quarter of  and in we expect to extend this website to facilitate the ordering and status of all of our risk assessment services 
we anticipate that the improvements we made  and continue to make  in our portamedic service delivery model will drive greater efficiency  higher quality and reduce operating cost in our branch office structure

the site describes the benefits of our synchronized services to all of our key constituents agents and brokers  health professionals  carriers and health wellness sponsors 
portamedic for the year ended december   portamedic revenues totaled million  a decrease of in comparison to the prior year 
we continue to believe that achieving acceptable profitability levels will require top line revenue growth and reversing past revenue declines 
although we have contracts or billing approvals with over of the insurance carriers in the marketplace  the number of paramedical examinations we complete on life insurance applicants continued to decline 
the rate of decline in completed examinations for was compared to  with an decline in compared to in order to reverse our decline in completed examinations  we are taking steps to achieve greater sales success with local agents  brokers  direct marketers and insurance carriers 
the market for portamedic s services has been negatively affected by both declining numbers of life insurance applications requiring paramed exams and steady price pressure on portamedic and its competitors 
according to limra s us individual life insurance sales trends   there were approximately million applications for life insurance completed in the united states in  compared to approximately million applications in we believe that the market continues to offer attractive opportunities to a company that can sell its services effectively and distinguish itself from its competitors 
we have taken the following steps to increase our market share and improve top line revenue we promoted and hired new field sales managers and grew our field sales force by almost 
we introduced new field sales and regional operations incentive compensation plans and performance measurement systems  while implementing a new customer relationship management system for our sales teams

in an effort to improve the speed  accuracy and consistency of services provided to our portamedic customers  we decided in december to begin the development of a new it system for processing customer orders 
we began the roll out of this system in the fourth quarter of the total system cost is expected to be million  including implementation costs  of which million was incurred as of december  we believe this new it system will enhance the quality of service to our customers  while improving productivity and decreasing future cash outlay 
in  we successfully completed our annual soc ii engagement formerly sas type ii  a third party review of our it processes and procedures for handling customer data 
we believe this review gives customers confidence in our information controls  information security and technology management processes 
we upgraded branch telephone systems to voice over ip  using our secure backbone network for voice communication 
we believe this will result in decreased future cash outlay for communications and increased customer satisfaction through faster response to calls 
although the number of paramedical examinations portamedic performs has declined from historical levels  we believe that we are a market leader in the industry 
we also believe that the steps we are taking to improve our selling ability  and the quality and speed of our services  will enable us to reduce the rate of decline experienced in the last several years 
heritage labs for the year ended december   heritage labs revenues totaled million and were consistent with the prior year period 
revenue from lab testing declined compared to  while revenues from lab kit assembly increased in compared to heritage labs services consist principally of performing tests of blood  urine and oral fluid specimens and the assembly and sale of kits used in the collection and transportation of such specimens to its lab facility 
in and  approximately of heritage labs revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of assembled lab specimen kits 
in  approximately of heritage labs revenue came from lab testing and came from the sale of assembled lab specimen kits 
most of heritage labs revenue originates from paramedical exam companies including portamedic  and therefore heritage labs is affected by the same negative market trends and conditions affecting portamedic  namely the decline in the number of life insurance applications 
in response  heritage labs has taken the following steps to expand its market share and increase revenues we have developed a risk score methodology to help our insurance clients better understand the mortality implications between and among interactions of multiple tests related to specific disease states 
we believe that the mortality data we are providing are unique and more complex than the data being provided by our competitors 
during  we shared our risk score data set and design approach with major re insurers to validate our methodology to risk scoring 
our objective has been to assist our clients in their ability to develop new insurance products and establish more accurate premium rating or pricing techniques using the lab mortality data that we have developed 
we have developed sales initiatives designed to increase the number of paramedical examinations completed by our portamedic service line that generate lab testing orders for heritage labs 
we have also developed sales initiatives designed to increase the volume of lab test orders for heritage labs that are not generated by portamedic exams 
while we intend for these measures to increase our market share and revenues  there can be no assurance we will achieve those results 
we believe that  as a result of the initiatives noted above  along with portamedic revenue improvements  we may achieve future growth at heritage labs 
health wellness our health wellness service line recorded revenues of approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or approximately  from the prior year 
in  we performed approximately  health screenings  compared to approximately  screenings in we provided our services to health management companies and clinical research organizations in  up from companies in we have conducted screening events in every state in the us as well as the district of columbia and puerto rico 
currently  we have approximately  wellness certified health professionals in our network 
health wellness services include event scheduling  provision and fulfillment of all supplies eg  examination kits  blood pressure cuffs  stadiometers  scales  centrifuges  lab coats  bandages  etc 
at screening events  event management  biometric screenings height  weight  body mass index  hip  waist  neck  pulse  blood pressure  blood draws via venipuncture or finger stick  lab testing  participant and aggregate reporting  data processing and data transmission 
heritage labs does all of the testing on the venipuncture samples we collect at health and wellness screenings 
we believe the market for health and wellness is likely to grow over the next three to five years  and that we are well positioned to increase revenues from our biometric screening and coaching services 
several recent milestones expected to grow revenues include we announced that hooper holmes had been chosen to collect biological samples for the largest government study of tobacco use ever conducted in the united states 
this five year study  which begins in  will draw upon our strengths  including our national network of local health professionals and heritage labs kit manufacturing 
we were chosen for this work by westat  a leading research and statistical survey organization 
we concluded our search for our new senior vice president  healthcare with the appointment of susheel jain 
mr 
jain joined us from wellpoint  one of the largest health benefits companies in the country  where he was responsible for developing new care management services  including integrated wellness and incentive solutions 
also in march  we were named vendor of the year by healthways  inc  a leading provider of health improvement solutions to employers  in recognition of the high level of participant satisfaction delivered by hooper holmes 
in october  we introduced hooper holmes onsite sm  a face to face  on premises health coaching service for work locations with any number of employees 
the service is delivered by specially trained health champions many of whom are physical therapists  personal trainers and nutritionists 
we believe onsite is an important addition to our service line because it better enables our customers to deliver behavior change and motivation 
we believe that we are well positioned to capture a significant share of the health and care management market given our company s unique set of assets  including heritage labs  our proprietary health wellness it system  and our network of certified health professionals 
however  the success of health wellness will depend in part upon the yet to be proven benefits of health and care management initiatives to the employers and others who sponsor them

through march   we are also obligated to pay  on a monthly basis in arrears  an unused line fee usage fee equal to per annum on the difference between million and the average daily outstanding principal balance of cash advances under the revolving credit line plus the average daily aggregate undrawn portion of all outstanding letters of credit for the preceding month 
effective march   the usage fee will be one half of one percent per annum 
in addition  we are required to pay an annual loan fee of million 
during the each of the three years ended december   we incurred unused line fees of million 
on april   we obtained from td bank and issued a letter of credit under the loan and security agreement in the amount of million to the landlord of our heritage labs facility as security for performance of our obligations under the lease 
the letter of credit expired on december  also  in december  we opened a million td visa credit card account to be used by hooper holmes services medical records retrieval service line 
the letter of credit and the credit card reduced our borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the revolving line of credit totaled million which is of eligible receivables and there were no outstanding borrowings 
the revolving credit loans are payable in full  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  on the earlier of march  or the date of termination of the loan commitments  termination being one of the actions td bank may take upon the occurrence of an event of default 
we may prepay any revolving credit loan  in whole or in part without penalty  with the amount of such prepayment available to be reborrowed  subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement as amended 
we may also terminate the loan and security agreement  provided that on the date of such termination all of its obligations are paid in full 
we are subject to a fee equal to million upon early termination of the loan and security agreement 
as security for our full and timely payment and other obligations under the loan and security agreement  we granted td bank a security interest in all of our existing and after acquired property and our subsidiary guarantors  including our receivables which are subject to a lockbox account arrangement  inventory and equipment 
as further security  we granted td bank a mortgage lien encumbering our corporate headquarters 
the aforementioned security interest and mortgage lien are collectively referred to herein as the collateral 
pursuant to the terms of the loan and security agreement  td bank  in its sole discretion based upon its reasonable credit judgment  may a establish and change reserves required against eligible receivables  b change the advance rate against eligible receivables or the fair market value of our corporate headquarters  and c impose additional restrictions on the standards of eligibility for eligible receivables  any of which could reduce the aggregate amount of indebtedness that may be incurred under the loan and security agreement 
the loan and security agreement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability  and that of our subsidiaries  to pay any dividends or distributions on  or redeem or retire any shares of any class of our capital stock or other equity interests  incur additional indebtedness  sell or otherwise dispose of any of our assets  other than in the ordinary course of business  create liens on our assets  enter into any sale and leaseback transactions  and enter into transactions with any of our affiliates on other than an arm s length or no less favorable basis 
the loan and security agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the loan and security agreement  and as amended under the third amendment noted above  measured on a rolling month basis of not less that to as of any fiscal quarter ending after september  if  for any one or more day s following any such fiscal quarter end  a the outstanding balance of cash advances under the loan and security agreement is greater than and b the amount of our cash on deposit with td bank is less than million 
as of december   both because our cash on deposit with td bank exceeded million and our outstanding balance of cash advances under the loan and security agreement was  compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio is not applicable 
however  if this covenant did apply  our fixed charge coverage ratio measured as specified in the loan and security agreement as of december  was to as such  we would fail this financial covenant and therefore would have no borrowing capability under the terms of our loan and security agreement 
our failure or that of any subsidiary guarantor to comply with any of the covenants or the breach of any of our or their representations and warranties  contained in the loan and security agreement  constitutes an event of default under the agreement 
in addition  the loan and security agreement provides that events of default include the occurrence or failure of any event or condition that  in td bank s sole judgment  could have a material adverse effect i on the our business  operations  assets  management  liabilities or condition  ii in the value of or the perfection or priority of td bank s lien upon the collateral  or iii on our ability and our subsidiary guarantors to perform under the loan and security agreement 
the current challenging economic climate may lead to future reductions in revenues 
if revenues continue to decline compared to the prior year  operating losses may continue to occur  we may be required to take additional actions to further reduce costs and capital spending  and restructure operations 
this would also reduce our cash reserves and potentially require us to borrow under the loan and security agreement with td bank 
furthermore  there is no guarantee that our current and future cost reduction actions will generate the cost savings necessary to offset declining revenues 
if we are unsuccessful in implementing additional cost reduction initiatives and or if revenues continue to decline at levels similar to or worse than that experienced in  we may fail to satisfy the financial covenant contained in the loan and security agreement and therefore would be prohibited from borrowing under the loan and security agreement 
further  as defined in the loan and security agreement  td bank may at its sole discretion request additional security  reduce availability or determine if negative events are events of default 
these and other factors would adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to generate profits in the future 
based on our anticipated level of future revenues  the cost reduction initiatives implemented to date  our existing cash  cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity  we believe we have sufficient funds to meet our cash needs through december  cash flows from operating activities for the years ended december   and  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million  million and million  respectively

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
share repurchases we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during  or dividends no dividends were paid in  or we are precluded from declaring or making any dividend payments or other distributions of assets with respect to any class of our equity securities under the terms of the loan and security agreement with td bank 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our schedule of contractual obligations at december   including future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating and capital leases  employment contract payments and our software license fees 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations capital lease obligations employment contracts total inflation inflation has not had  nor is it expected to have  a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is important to the portrayal of a company s operating results and or financial condition and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these determinations upon the best information available to us during the period in which we are accounting for our results 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change or as further information becomes available 
further  these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
changes in our estimates are recorded in the period the change occurs 
we have identified the accounting policies discussed below as critical to us 
the discussion below is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for paramedical and medical examinations when the examination of the insurance policy applicant is completed 
revenues generated from medical record collection  laboratory testing  fingerstick test kits and other services are recognized when the related service is completed 
in all cases  there must be evidence of an agreement with the customer  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery of services must occur and the ability to collect must be reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for i estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  and ii estimated amounts that customers may deduct from their remittances to us for billed items not in compliance with customer specifications 
management regularly assesses the financial condition of our customers  the markets in which these customers participate as well as historical trends relating to customer deductions and adjusts the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this review 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  our ability to collect on accounts receivable could be negatively impacted  in which case additional allowances may be required 
we must make significant management judgments and estimates in determining allowances for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
one significant uncertainty inherent in our analysis is whether our past experience will be indicative of future periods 
adverse changes in general economic conditions could affect our allowance estimates  collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets and assets to be disposed long lived assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is a condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the following are examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a current period operating cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the process to identify if there is impairment includes the following steps a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the long lived assets or asset group to the carrying value of the long lived assets or asset group  and if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted net cash flows  an impairment is identified 
the amount of the impairment is based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived assets to its fair value 
we estimate the fair value of the long lived assets based on discounted cash flow models 
as discussed in the results of operations  due to the decline in revenues during  and  principally due to the downturn in the economy and its negative impact on the life insurance industry in which we serve  we performed an impairment analysis of our intangible assets 
based on the analysis  we concluded that the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by our intangible assets primarily customer relationships  exceeded their carrying values 
as a result  no impairment was recorded on our intangible assets during  and assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on the continued decline in revenues  the cumulative tax and operating losses  the lack of taxes in the carryback period and the uncertainty surrounding the extent or timing of future taxable income  we do not believe that we will realize the tax benefits of our deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we continue to record a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million federal tax benefit due to the utilization of fully reserved net operating losses that were carried back to under the worker  homeownership and business assistance act of  signed into law in the fourth quarter of share based compensation authoritative accounting literature addresses the accounting for transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
this literature establishes accounting principles which require companies to recognize compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based payments  such as stock options or non vested stock granted to employees 
compensation cost for stock options and non vested stock is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
the accounting principles also require that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values of options are based on assumptions  including estimated lives  volatility  dividend yield  and risk free interest rates 
these estimates also consider the probability that the options will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder  which are based on reasonable estimates and historical trends but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowing activities  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
our credit facility is based on variable rates and is therefore subject to interest rate fluctuations 
accordingly  our interest expense will vary as a result of interest rate changes and the level of any outstanding borrowings 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding 
as of december   we have determined that there was no material market risk exposure to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of such date
