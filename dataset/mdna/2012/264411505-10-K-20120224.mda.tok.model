item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a self administered and self managed reit that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office  medical office and other properties  of which properties with approximately million square feet are in service and six properties with approximately  square feet are under development 
the in service properties are comprised of consolidated properties with approximately million square feet and jointly controlled properties with approximately million square feet 
the six properties under development consist of five consolidated properties with more than  square feet and one jointly controlled property with approximately  square feet 
owned  including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures  more than  acres of land and controlled an additional  acres through purchase options 
we have three reportable operating segments  the first two of which consist of the ownership and rental of i office and ii industrial real estate investments 
the operations of our office and industrial properties  along with our medical office and retail properties  are collectively referred to as rental operations 
our medical office and retail properties do not by themselves meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as reportable segments 
the third reportable segment consists of providing various real estate services such as property management  asset management  maintenance  leasing  development and construction management to third party property owners and joint ventures  and is collectively referred to as service operations 
our reportable segments offer different products or services and are managed separately because each segment requires different operating strategies and management expertise 
our service operations segment also includes our taxable reit subsidiary  a legal entity through which certain of the segment s operations are conducted 
operations strategy our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations as well as funds from operations ffo through i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties  ii selectively developing new pre leased medical office and build to suit projects at accretive returns  iii leveraging our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager on a fee basis  and iv providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
asset strategy our asset strategy is to reposition our investment concentration among product types and further diversify our geographic presence 
our strategic objectives include i increasing our investment in quality industrial properties in both existing markets and select new markets  ii expanding our medical office portfolio nationally to take advantage of demographic trends  iii increasing our asset investment in markets we believe provide the best potential for future growth  and iv reducing our investment in suburban office properties located primarily in the midwest as well as reducing our investment in other non strategic assets 
we are executing our asset strategy through a disciplined approach in identifying accretive acquisition opportunities and our focused development initiatives  which are financed primarily from our active asset disposition program 
capital strategy our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure  in coordination with the execution of our overall operating and asset strategy 
we are focused on maintaining investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies with the ultimate goal of improving the key metrics that formulate our credit ratings 
in support of our capital strategy  we employ an asset disposition program to sell non strategic real estate assets  which generates proceeds that can be recycled into new property investments that better fit our growth objectives or can be used to reduce leverage and otherwise manage our capital structure 
we continue to focus on improving our balance sheet by maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  and iii issuing common equity from time to time to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic acquisitions 
with our successes to date and continued focus on strengthening our balance sheet  we believe we are well positioned for future growth 
year in review the slow pace of recovery in the general economy has continued to present challenges for the commercial real estate industry during there has been some improvement in a few key metrics such as unemployment  however  the downgrade of the united states credit rating by standard poor s  unresolved united states national debt ceiling discussions and sovereign debt issues in europe continue to weigh heavily on the willingness and ability of businesses to make long term capital commitments 
notwithstanding the condition of the economy  as noted hereafter  we were able to execute on our operations  asset and capital strategies  including the execution of a significant portfolio sale the blackstone office disposition that allowed us to reduce our overall investment concentration in suburban office properties 
net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december   was million  or per share diluted  compared to a net loss of million  or per share diluted for the year ended december  the improvement in from the net loss position was mainly the result of a million increase in gains on sales of properties 
partially offsetting this positive change in property sale gains was a million decrease in income related to acquisition related activity  as a gain of million was recognized in upon the acquisition of our joint venture partner s interest in dugan realty  llc dugan  a real estate joint venture that we had previously accounted for using the equity method 
ffo attributable to common shareholders totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for  with the decrease driven primarily by the million gain on the acquisition of dugan in industry analysts and investors use ffo as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the most comparable gaap measure is net income loss attributable to common shareholders 
ffo attributable to common shareholders should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss attributable to common shareholders or any other measures derived in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of nareit  which was clarified during the fourth quarter of to exclude impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and certain investments in joint ventures 
as a result of this clarification  we have revised our calculation of ffo for to exclude million of such impairment charges 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents gaap net income loss  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management believes that the use of ffo attributable to common shareholders  combined with net income which remains the primary measure of performance  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management believes that excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and real estate asset depreciation and amortization enables investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assist them in comparing these operating results between periods or between different companies 
the following table shows a reconciliation of net income loss attributable to common shareholders to the calculation of ffo attributable to common shareholders for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands net income loss attributable to common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization impairment charges on depreciable properties earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture noncontrolling interest share of adjustments funds from operations attributable to common shareholders we continued to make significant progress during in executing our stated asset strategy of increasing our investment in industrial and medical office properties and reducing our investment in suburban office properties 
additionally  we improved in most of our key operational metrics which is an indication of continued execution of our operations strategy 
highlights of our strategic activities are as follows in the first four months of  we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of primarily industrial properties in south florida the premier portfolio  for which we had already purchased industrial properties and one office property in late the acquisitions consisted of twelve industrial and four office buildings with a total acquisition date value of million 
the premier portfolio  in its entirety  includes industrial and five office buildings with over million rentable square feet and four ground leases  for a total acquisition date value of million 
during  in addition to completing the acquisition of the premier portfolio  we demonstrated further progress on our asset strategy by acquiring industrial properties  eleven medical office properties and three suburban office properties with a total value of million 
we generated billion of total net cash proceeds from the disposition of wholly owned buildings  either through outright sales or partial sales to unconsolidated joint ventures  as well as selling acres of wholly owned undeveloped land 
included in the wholly owned building dispositions in is the blackstone office disposition  by which we sold substantially all of our wholly owned suburban office real estate properties in atlanta  chicago  columbus  dallas  minneapolis  orlando and tampa 
the blackstone office disposition consisted of buildings that had an aggregate of million rentable square feet 
these buildings were sold for a sales price of approximately billion which  after the settlement of certain working capital items and the payment of applicable transaction costs  was received in a combination of approximately billion in cash and the assumption by the buyer of approximately million of mortgage debt 
also included in the wholly owned building dispositions in is the sale of suburban office buildings  totaling over million square feet  to a owned joint venture 
these buildings were sold to the joint venture for a value of million  of which our share of proceeds totaled million 
we have limited our new development starts to selected projects in markets or product types expected to have strong future rent growth and demand or projects that have significant pre leasing 
the total estimated cost of our consolidated properties under construction was million at december   with million of such costs incurred through that date 
the total estimated cost for jointly controlled properties under construction was million at december   with million of costs incurred through that date 
the occupancy level for our in service portfolio of consolidated properties increased from at december  to at december  the increase in occupancy was primarily driven by our acquisition and disposition activities as well as leasing up vacant space 
despite the continued slow pace of the overall economic recovery  we continued to have strong total leasing activity for our consolidated properties  with total leasing activity of million square feet in compared to million square feet in total leasing activity for our consolidated properties in included million square feet of renewals  which represented a success rate and resulted in a reduction in net effective rents 
we executed a number of significant transactions in support of our capital strategy during in order to optimally sequence our unsecured debt maturities  manage our overall leverage profile  and support our acquisition strategy 
highlights of our key financing activities in are as follows in december  we repaid the remaining million of our exchangeable senior notes exchangeable notes at their scheduled maturity date 
due to accounting requirements  under which we recorded interest expense on this debt at a similar rate as could have been obtained for non convertible debt  this debt had an effective interest rate of 
in november  we renewed and extended the term of our unsecured line of credit 
the renewed facility matures in december  has a one year extension option  and bears interest at libor plus basis points 
the previous million facility did not have an extension option and bore interest at libor plus basis points 
in july  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series n cumulative redeemable preferred shares series n shares at a liquidation amount of million 
we assumed secured loans in conjunction with our acquisitions 
these assumed loans had a total face value of million 
key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial  office  medical office and retail properties collectively referred to as rental operations 
the following discussion highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues 
occupancy analysis as previously discussed  our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations 
the following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of consolidated rental properties as of december  and  respectively in thousands  except percentage data total square feet percent of total square feet percent leased type industrial office other medical office and retail total the increase in occupancy at december  compared to december  is primarily driven by changes in our portfolio that resulted from our acquisition and disposition activity 
specifically  we disposed of properties during  totaling approximately million square feet  that had average occupancy on sale of approximately  while we acquired properties totaling approximately million square feet that had average occupancy on acquisition of approximately 
continued lease up activity within our portfolio also contributed to the increase in occupancy 
lease expiration and renewals our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects our consolidated in service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of december  the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands  except percentage data total portfolio industrial office other year of expiration square feet ann 
rent revenue of revenue square feet ann 
rent revenue square feet ann 
rent revenue square feet ann 
rent revenue and thereafter total portfolio square feet percent leased within our consolidated properties  we renewed and of our leases up for renewal  totaling approximately million and million square feet in and  respectively 
our renewal percentage was lower in due to the expiration of a few individually large industrial leases where the tenants space requirements were reduced and the leases were not renewed 
barring any unforeseen deterioration in general economic conditions  we believe our renewal percentage in should approximate historical levels  which have generally ranged between to 
there was a decline in net effective rents on our renewals during  compared to a decline in the decline in net effective rents on renewal leases during is largely attributable to the expiration of leases originated during better economic conditions existing between and the change in net effective rents upon renewal improved from in large part as the result of lower vacancy in many of our markets and  also barring any unforeseen deterioration in general economic conditions  we anticipate continued slight improvement in net effective rents as compared to acquisitions in  we acquired properties and other real estate related assets with a total acquisition date value of million  including properties purchased in completion of the premier portfolio acquisition 
these acquisitions represent further advancement of our strategy to increase our concentration in industrial and medical office properties and included industrial properties  eleven medical office properties and seven suburban office properties 
on july   we acquired our joint venture partner s interest in dugan  a real estate joint venture that we had previously accounted for using the equity method 
at the date of acquisition  dugan owned industrial buildings totaling million square feet and net acres of undeveloped land located in midwest and southeast markets 
the total acquisition date value of dugan s assets was million and we also assumed liabilities  including secured debt  having a total fair value of million 
in addition to the acquisition of dugan  we also acquired properties in with a total acquisition date value of million 
these acquisitions included the initial properties from the premier portfolio  which were acquired on december  also in  one of our unconsolidated joint ventures  in which we have a equity interest  acquired two properties for million 
we contributed million to the joint venture for our share of these acquisitions 
dispositions net cash proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned undeveloped land and buildings totaled billion in  compared to million in included in the building dispositions in is the building blackstone office disposition  with a sales price of approximately billion which  after settlement of certain working capital items and the payment of applicable transaction costs  was paid in a combination of approximately billion in cash and the assumption by the buyer of mortgage debt with a face value of approximately million 
also included in the building dispositions in is the sale of suburban office buildings  totaling over million square feet  to an existing owned unconsolidated joint venture 
these buildings were sold to the unconsolidated joint venture for a value of million  of which our share of proceeds totaled million 
included in the building dispositions in is the sale of seven suburban office buildings  totaling over million square feet  to the same owned joint venture 
these buildings were sold to the unconsolidated joint venture for an agreed value of million  of which our share of proceeds totaled million 
future development another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint venture development activities 
we expect to generate future earnings from rental operations as the development properties are placed in service and leased 
we continue to direct a significant portion of our available resources toward acquisition activities as well as development activities in industrial and medical office properties with significant pre leasing in markets that we believe will provide future growth 
we believe these two product lines will be the areas of greatest future growth 
we had  square feet of consolidated or jointly controlled properties under development with total estimated costs upon completion of million at december   compared to million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of million at december  the square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture development activity at 
the following table summarizes our properties under development as of december  in thousands  except percentage data ownership type square feet percent leased total estimated project costs total incurred to date amount remaining to be spent consolidated properties joint venture properties total results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   is as follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share data rental and related revenue general contractor and service fee revenue operating income loss net income loss attributable to common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares and potential dilutive securities basic income loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income loss per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service consolidated properties at end of year in service consolidated square footage at end of year number of in service joint venture properties at end of year in service joint venture square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental and related revenue the following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental and related revenue office industrial non reportable segments total the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below we acquired properties  of which were industrial  and placed nine developments in service from january  to december   which provided incremental revenues of million in the year ended december  we consolidated industrial buildings as a result of acquiring our joint venture partner s interest in dugan on july  the consolidation of these buildings resulted in an increase of million in rental and related revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in we sold office properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in and the first quarter of  resulting in a million decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations in the remaining increase in rental and related revenues is primarily due to improved results within the properties that have been in service for all of and although rental rates declined slightly on our lease renewals  improved occupancy drove the overall improvement within these properties 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non reportable segments total real estate taxes office industrial non reportable segments total we recognized incremental rental expenses of million associated with the additional properties acquired of which were industrial and nine developments placed in service since january  the july  consolidation of industrial buildings in dugan also resulted in a million increase in rental expense for industrial properties 
the aforementioned increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to properties that were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture during and the first quarter of we recognized incremental real estate taxes of million associated with the additional properties acquired and nine developments placed in service since january  the july  consolidation of industrial buildings in dugan resulted in incremental real estate taxes of million 
the aforementioned increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to properties that were sold to an unconsolidated joint venture during and the first quarter of the remaining increases were the result of increased taxes on our properties that have been in service for all of and service operations the following table sets forth the components of the service operations reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands service operations general contractor and service fee revenue general contractor and other services expenses total service operations primarily consist of the leasing  property management  asset management  development  construction management and general contractor services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
service operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy  as leasing and property management fees are dependent upon occupancy  while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third party property owners and joint venture partners 
the increase in earnings from service operations was due to increased profitability on third party construction activities performed during compared to  as overall construction volume was relatively consistent between the years 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in primarily due to shorter lived lease based intangible assets being recognized in conjunction with our acquisition activity in and equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income or loss from investments in unconsolidated companies that generally own and operate rental properties 
equity in earnings decreased from million in to million in the decrease was largely due to the consolidation of properties upon the acquisition of our partner s interest in dugan on july  gain on sale of properties gains on sales of properties classified in continuing operations increased to million in from million in we sold properties during that did not meet the criteria for inclusion in discontinued operations  compared to of such properties in of the properties sold in and  and seven properties  respectively  were sold to a owned joint venture 
the combined gain on sale of these properties was million and million in and  respectively 
impairment charges impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets 
the increase from million in to million in is primarily due to the following activity in  we recognized million of impairment charges related to parcels of land  which we intend to sell  where recent market activity led us to determine that a decline in fair value had occurred 
in  we sold approximately acres of land  in two separate transactions  which resulted in impairment charges of million 
these sales were opportunistic in nature and we had not identified or actively marketed this land for disposition  as it was previously intended to be held for development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist of two components 
the first component includes general corporate expenses and the second component includes the indirect operating costs not allocated to the development or operations of our wholly owned properties and service operations 
those indirect costs not allocated to or absorbed by these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in resulted from an increase in our overall pool of overhead expenses  primarily due to an increase in severance pay related to an overhead reduction that took place near the end of somewhat reducing the impact of this increase in overall overhead expenses was an increase in the absorption of indirect costs from leasing activities during interest expense interest expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily a result of increased average outstanding debt during compared to  which was driven by our acquisition activities as well as other uses of capital 
a million decrease in the capitalization of interest costs  the result of reduced development activity  also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
gain loss on debt transactions there were no gains or losses on debt transactions during during  through a cash tender offer and open market transactions  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in and in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million 
we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of million after considering the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  discounts and other accounting adjustments 
acquisition related activity during  we recognized approximately million in acquisition costs  compared to million of such costs in during  we also recognized a million gain related to the acquisition of a building from one of our owned unconsolidated joint ventures  compared to a million gain in on the acquisition of our joint venture partner s interest in dugan 
discontinued operations subject to certain criteria  the results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties or classified as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  allocated interest expense  depreciation expense and impairment charges as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
the operations of buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations 
these buildings consist of industrial  office  and three retail properties 
as a result  we classified losses  before gain on sales and impairment charges  of  million and million in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  were sold during  properties were sold during and five properties were sold during the gains on disposal of these properties of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations 
discontinued operations also includes impairment charges of million for the year ended december  recognized on properties that were subsequently sold 
there are properties classified as held for sale at december  comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental and related revenue the following table sets forth rental and related revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental and related revenue office industrial non reportable segments total the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below we consolidated industrial buildings as a result of acquiring our joint venture partner s interest in dugan on july  the consolidation of these buildings resulted in an increase of million in rental and related revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in including the december  acquisition of the first tranche of the premier portfolio  we acquired or consolidated an additional properties and placed developments in service from january  to december   which provided incremental revenues of million in the year ended december  we contributed properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in and  resulting in a million reduction in rental and related revenue in we sold eight properties in and that were excluded from discontinued operations as a result of continuing involvement in the properties through management agreements 
these dispositions resulted in a decrease in rental and related revenue from continuing operations of million in rental and related revenue includes lease termination fees  which relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligation before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees included in continuing operations decreased from million in to million in average occupancy for the year ended december  decreased slightly for our office properties  while increasing for our industrial properties  when compared to the year ended december  these changes in occupancy  as well as decreases in rental rates in certain of our lease renewals  resulted in a net decrease to rental and related revenues which partially offset the increases generated from acquisitions and developments placed in service 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non reportable segments total real estate taxes office industrial non reportable segments total of the overall million increase in rental expenses in compared to  million was attributable to the consolidation of the industrial buildings that resulted from the acquisition of our partner s interest in dugan on july  there were also incremental costs of million associated with the additional properties acquired or otherwise consolidated and developments placed in service 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in rental expenses of approximately million related to properties that were sold in and  but did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
overall  real estate taxes increased by million in compared to the primary reason for this increase is the consolidation of an additional industrial buildings related to the acquisition of dugan  which resulted in incremental real estate taxes of million 
there were also incremental costs of million associated with the additional properties acquired or otherwise consolidated and developments placed in service 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in real estate taxes of approximately million related to properties that were sold in and  but did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations 
service operations the following table sets forth the components of the service operations reportable segment for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands service operations general contractor and service fee revenue general contractor and other services expenses total the increase in earnings from service operations was largely the result of an overall increase in third party construction volume and fees 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased from million in to million in due to increases in our real estate asset base from properties acquired or consolidated and developments placed in service during and the consolidation of additional industrial properties related to the july  acquisition of our partner s ownership interest in dugan resulted in million of additional depreciation expense 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings decreased from million in to million in the decrease was largely the result of the acquisition of dugan  which was previously accounted for under the equity method  which took place on july  gain on sale of properties gains on sales of properties classified in continuing operations increased from million in to million in we sold nine properties in compared to properties in because the properties sold in and either had insignificant operations prior to sale or because we maintained varying forms of continuing involvement after sale  they are not classified within discontinued operations 
seven of the properties sold in  with a combined gain on sale of million  were made to a newly formed subsidiary of an existing owned joint venture to which we sold additional properties during impairment charges impairment charges classified in continuing operations include the impairment of undeveloped land and buildings  investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other real estate related assets 
the decrease from million in to million in is primarily due to the following activity in  we sold approximately acres of land  in two separate transactions  which resulted in impairment charges of million 
these sales were opportunistic in nature and we had not identified or actively marketed this land for disposition  as it was previously intended to be held for development 
a result of the refinement of our business strategy that took place in was the decision to dispose of approximately  acres of land  which had a total cost basis of million  rather than holding it for future development 
our change in strategy for this land triggered the requirement to conduct an impairment analysis  which resulted in a determination that a significant portion of the land  representing over of the land s carrying value  was impaired 
we recognized impairment charges on land of million in  primarily as the result of writing down to fair value the land that was identified for disposition and determined to be impaired 
also in  an impairment charge of million was recognized for office  industrial and retail buildings 
nine of these properties met the criteria for discontinued operations at december   either as a result of being sold or classified as held for sale  and the million of impairment charges related to these properties is accordingly reflected in discontinued operations 
the impairment analysis was triggered either as the result of changes in management s strategy  resulting in certain buildings being identified as non strategic  or changes in market conditions 
we hold a ownership interest in an unconsolidated entity the peachtree joint venture whose sole activity is the development and operation of the office component of a multi use office and residential high rise building located in the buckhead sub market of atlanta 
we recognized an impairment charge in to write off our million investment in the peachtree joint venture as the result of an other than temporary decline in value 
as a result of the joint venture s obligations to the lender in its construction loan agreement  the likelihood that our partner will be unable to contribute their share of the additional equity to fund the joint venture s future capital costs  and ultimately from our contingent obligation stemming from our joint and several guarantee of the joint venture s loan  we recorded an additional liability of million in for our probable future obligation to the lender 
in  we recognized a million charge on our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture the park creek joint venture 
we recognized million of impairment charges on other real estate related assets in  which related primarily to reserving loans receivable from other real estate entities  as well as writing off previously deferred development costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease resulted from a million reduction in our total overhead costs  which was largely a result of reduced severance charges when compared to the reduction in overall overhead expenses was partially offset by a million decrease in overhead costs absorbed by an allocation to leasing  construction and other areas  which was primarily a result of lower wholly owned construction and development activities than in interest expense interest expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the increase was largely the result of a million decrease in the capitalization of interest costs  due to properties previously undergoing significant development activities being placed in service or otherwise not meeting the criteria for the capitalization of interest 
the remaining increase in interest expense was largely the result of our acquisition activity which  in addition to other uses of capital  drove higher overall borrowings in gain loss on debt transactions during  through a cash tender offer and open market transactions  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in and in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million 
we recognized a net loss on extinguishment of million after considering the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  discounts and other accounting adjustments 
during  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in through the majority of our debt repurchases during were of our exchangeable notes 
in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million  recognizing a net gain on extinguishment of million after considering the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs  discounts and other accounting adjustments 
partially offsetting these gains  we recognized million of expense in for the write off of fees paid for a pending secured financing that we cancelled in the third quarter of income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million and million  respectively  in and we recorded a net valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets during the valuation allowance was recorded as the result of changes to our projections for future taxable income within our taxable reit subsidiary 
the decreased projection of taxable income was the result of a revision in strategy  whereby we determined that we would indefinitely discontinue the development  within our taxable reit subsidiary  of properties intended to be sold for a profit at or near completion  necessitating the revision of our taxable income projections 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions  and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity a vie and would require consolidation 
we i evaluate the sufficiency of the total equity at risk  ii review the voting rights and decision making authority of the equity investment holders as a group  and whether there are any guaranteed returns  protection against losses  or capping of residual returns within the group and iii establish whether activities within the venture are on behalf of an investor with disproportionately few voting rights in making this vie determination 
we would consolidate a venture that is determined to be a vie if we were the primary beneficiary 
beginning january   a new accounting standard became effective and changed the method by which the primary beneficiary of a vie is determined to a primarily qualitative approach whereby the variable interest holder  if any  that controls a vie s most significant activities is the primary beneficiary 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as vies  we further assess each partner s substantive participating rights to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
we have equity interests in unconsolidated joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
to the extent applicable  we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be vie s where we are the primary beneficiary 
for non variable interest entities  we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in earnings of the joint venture 
we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
we capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains occupancy 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized 
impairment of real estate assets we evaluate our real estate assets  with the exception of those that are classified as held for sale  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such an evaluation is considered necessary  we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset  or asset group  with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of that asset  or asset group 
our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on  among other things  our estimates regarding future market conditions  rental rates  occupancy levels  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other tenant concessions  assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of our anticipated holding period and is  therefore  subjective by nature 
these assumptions could differ materially from actual results 
if our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
to the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset  or asset group  exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective  especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions 
we primarily utilize the income approach to estimate the fair value of our income producing real estate assets 
to the extent that the assumptions used in testing long lived assets for impairment differ from those of a marketplace participant  the assumptions are modified in order to estimate the fair value of a real estate asset when an impairment charge is measured 
in addition to determining future cash flows  which make the estimation of a real estate asset s undiscounted cash flows highly subjective  the selection of the discount rate and exit capitalization rate used in applying the income approach is also highly subjective 
to the extent applicable marketplace data is available  we generally use the market approach in estimating the fair value of undeveloped land that is determined to be impaired 
real estate assets that are classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
acquisition of real estate property and related assets we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
we record assets acquired in step acquisitions at their full fair value and record a gain or loss for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our existing equity interest 
additionally  contingencies arising from a business combination are recorded at fair value if the acquisition date fair value can be determined during the measurement period 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of rent due under leases or of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and prospective tenants before leases are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectability of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of current rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
to the extent that a fixed price contract is estimated to result in a loss  the loss is recorded immediately 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies  methodology in applying our critical accounting policies  and impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity at december  we held million of cash  we had no outstanding borrowings on our million unsecured line of credit  and we also had the ability to issue up to million worth of new shares of common stock pursuant to an at the market program  which has a prospectus supplement currently on file with the sec 
we believe that these sources of liquidity  in addition to our cash flows from rental operations  will provide more than sufficient capacity to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months 
in addition to our existing sources of liquidity  we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  through multiple sources of capital including operating cash flow and accessing the public debt and equity markets 
rental operations cash flows from rental operations is our primary source of liquidity and provides a stable cash flow to fund operational expenses 
we believe that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to a number of risks related to general economic conditions  including reduced occupancy  tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
in  we recognized million of expense related to reserving doubtful receivables  including reserves on straight line rent  compared to million in unsecured debt and equity securities our unsecured lines of credit as of december  are described as follows in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date outstanding balance at december  unsecured line of credit drlp december unsecured line of credit consolidated subsidiary july we renewed drlp s unsecured line of credit in november under the revised terms  the drlp unsecured line of credit continues to have a borrowing capacity of million with the interest rate on borrowings reduced to libor plus with no borrowings as of december  
the maturity date was extended from february to december subject to certain conditions  the terms also include an option to increase the facility by up to an additional million  for a total of up to billion 
this line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
this line of credit contains financial covenants that require us to meet certain financial ratios and defined levels of performance  including those related to fixed charge coverage  unsecured interest expense coverage and debt to asset value with asset value being defined in the drlp unsecured line of credit agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit 
at december   we had on file with the sec an automatic shelf registration statement on form s  relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of drlp s debt securities including guarantees thereof and the company s common shares  preferred shares and other securities 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of long term debt upon maturity and for other general corporate purposes 
pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement  at december   we had on file with the sec a prospectus supplement that allows us to issue new shares of our common stock  from time to time  pursuant to an at the market offering program  with an aggregate offering price of up to million 
no new shares have been issued pursuant to this prospectus supplement as of december  the indentures and related supplemental indentures governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  sale of real estate assets we regularly work to identify  consider and pursue opportunities to dispose of non strategic properties on an opportunistic basis and on a basis that is generally consistent with our strategic plans 
our ability to dispose of such properties on favorable terms  or at all  is dependent upon a number of factors including the availability of credit to potential buyers to purchase properties at prices that we consider acceptable 
although we believe that we have demonstrated our ability to generate significant liquidity through the disposition of non strategic properties  potential future adverse changes to general market and economic conditions could negatively impact our further ability to dispose of such properties 
transactions with unconsolidated entities transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity 
from time to time we will sell properties to unconsolidated entities  while retaining a continuing interest in that entity  and receive proceeds commensurate to those interests that we do not own 
additionally  unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us  and our joint venture partners  all or a portion of the proceeds from such debt offering 
we have a equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture duke hulfish which  along with its subsidiary entities  has acquired properties from us since its formation in may we have received cumulative net sale and financing proceeds of approximately million through december  we are party to an agreement that grants duke hulfish a right to participate in future build to suit or speculative developments on certain specified parcels of our undeveloped land 
during  we sold suburban office buildings totaling approximately million square feet to duke hulfish for million  of which our share of net proceeds totaled million 
during  we also received a net financing distribution of million  which was commensurate to our share of the net proceeds of permanent financing that was obtained by duke hulfish 
uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity include the following accretive property investment  leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt and preferred stock  and other contractual obligations 
property investment during we made further significant progress on an asset repositioning strategy that involves increasing our investment concentration in industrial and medical office properties while reducing our investment concentration in suburban office properties 
pursuant to this strategy  we will continue to evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook  supply and long term growth potential 
our ability to make future property investments  along with being dependent upon identifying suitable acquisition and development opportunities  is also dependent upon our continued access to our longer term sources of liquidity  including issuances of debt or equity securities as well as generating cash flow by disposing of selected properties 
in light of current economic conditions  management continues to evaluate our investment priorities and is focused on accretive long term growth 
leasing capital costs tenant improvements and leasing commissions related to the initial leasing of newly completed or acquired properties are referred to as first generation expenditures 
such expenditures are included within development of real estate investments and other deferred leasing costs in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
tenant improvements and leasing costs to re let rental space that had been previously under lease to tenants are referred to as second generation expenditures 
building improvements that are not specific to any tenant but serve to improve integral components of our real estate properties are also second generation expenditures 
one of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the second generation leasing capital expenditures of our real estate investments 
the following is a summary of our second generation capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands second generation tenant improvements second generation leasing costs building improvements totals both our first and second generation expenditures vary significantly between leases on a per square foot basis  dependent upon several factors including the product type  nature of a tenant s operations  the specific physical characteristics of each individual property as well as the market in which the property is located 
dividends and distributions we are required to meet the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  in order to maintain our reit status 
because depreciation and impairments are non cash expenses  cash flow will typically be greater than operating income 
we paid dividends per share of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to distribute at least an amount equal to our taxable earnings  to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status  and additional amounts as determined by our board of directors 
distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
at december  we had five series of preferred stock outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between and and are paid in arrears quarterly 
in july  we redeemed all of our series n shares for a total payment of million  thus reducing our future quarterly dividend commitments by million 
debt maturities debt outstanding at december  had a face value totaling billion with a weighted average interest rate of maturing at various dates through of this total amount  we had billion of unsecured notes  million outstanding on the unsecured line of credit of a consolidated subsidiary and billion of secured debt outstanding at december  scheduled principal amortization  repurchases and maturities of unsecured notes and secured debt totaled million for the year ended december  while we also made net repayments of million on drlp s million unsecured line of credit in the following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at december  in thousands  except percentage data future repayments weighted average year scheduled amortization maturities total interest rate of future repayments thereafter we anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from our rental operations and property dispositions  and by raising additional capital from future debt or equity transactions 
repurchases of outstanding debt and preferred stock to the extent that it supports our overall capital strategy  we may purchase certain of our outstanding unsecured debt prior to its stated maturity or redeem or repurchase certain of our outstanding series of preferred stock 
guarantee obligations we are subject to various guarantee obligations in the normal course of business and  in most cases  do not anticipate these obligations to result in significant cash payments 
we are  however  subject to a joint and several guarantee of the construction loan agreement of the peachtree joint venture 
a contingent liability in the amount of million  which represents our maximum remaining future exposure under the guarantee  is included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  based on the probability of us being required to pay this obligation to the lender 
historical cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating  investing and financing activities in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our rental operations and service operations activities 
the receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in from is  in large part  due to a million increase in cash outflows from third party construction contracts as well as a million increase in cash paid for interest 
our third party construction activities were profitable  in the aggregate  during and the net cash outflows during the year were the result of the timing of cash receipts and payments 
investing activities investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity 
development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements 
highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows real estate development costs totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in development activity is consistent with our strategy to limit new development starts to properties with significant pre leasing or in product lines and markets that we believe will provide future growth 
during  we paid cash of million for real estate acquisitions  compared to million in and million in in addition  we paid cash of million for undeveloped land in  compared to million in and million in sales of land and depreciated property provided billion in net proceeds in  compared to million in and million in during  we contributed or advanced million to fund development activities within unconsolidated companies  compared to million in and million in we received capital distributions as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million in and million in we received no such distributions from unconsolidated companies in financing activities the following items highlight significant capital transactions in december  we repaid the remaining million of our exchangeable notes at their scheduled maturity date 
in august and march  we also repaid million and million  respectively  of unsecured notes with an effective rate of and  respectively  at their scheduled maturity dates 
in january  we repaid million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of at their scheduled maturity date 
we also repaid million of corporate unsecured debt and million of senior unsecured notes with effective interest rates of and  respectively  at their scheduled maturity dates in february and november  respectively 
throughout and  we completed open market repurchases of approximately  shares and million shares  respectively  of our series o cumulative redeemable preferred shares the series o shares 
we paid million in for shares that had a face value of million  compared to million in for shares that had a face value of million 
in july  we redeemed all of the outstanding shares of our series n shares for a total payment of million 
we decreased net borrowings on drlp s million line of credit by million for the year ended december   compared to an increase of million in and a decrease of million in in april  we issued million of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at an effective rate of and mature in march in august  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due in bearing interest at an effective rate of and million of senior unsecured notes due in bearing interest at an effective rate of 
we had no senior unsecured note issuances in during  through a cash tender offer and open market transactions  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes scheduled to mature in and in total  we paid million for unsecured notes that had a face value of million 
throughout  we repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in through in total  cash payments of million were made to repurchase notes with a face value of million 
in june  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
in april  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
we had no common stock issuances in we paid cash dividends of per common share in  compared to cash dividends of per common share in and per common share in in february  march and july  we received cash proceeds of million from three year secured debt financings that are secured by rental properties 
the secured debt bears interest at a weighted average rate of and matures at various points in credit ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from moody s investors service and standard and poor s ratings group 
our senior unsecured notes have been assigned ratings of bbb and baa by standard and poor s ratings group and moody s investors service  respectively 
our preferred shares carry ratings of bb and baa from standard and poor s ratings group and moody s investors service  respectively 
the ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon  among other things  the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition 
financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in unconsolidated companies we have equity interests in unconsolidated partnerships and limited liability companies that primarily own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these unconsolidated joint ventures are primarily engaged in the operations and development of industrial  office and medical office real estate properties 
the equity method of accounting see critical accounting policies is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over operating and financial policies 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these entities are not included on our balance sheet 
our investments in and advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries represent approximately of our total assets as of december  and  respectively 
we believe that these investments provide several benefits to us  including increased market share  tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects 
the following table presents summarized financial information for unconsolidated companies for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except percentage data joint ventures land  buildings and tenant improvements  net construction in progress undeveloped land other assets indebtedness other liabilities owners equity rental revenue gain on sale of properties net income total square feet percent leased we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships special purpose entities that have been established solely for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations at december   we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the following table payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt lines of credit share of debt of unconsolidated joint ventures ground leases operating leases development and construction backlog costs other total contractual obligations our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rates as of december  our unsecured lines of credit consist of an operating line of credit that matures december and the line of credit of a consolidated subsidiary that matures july interest expense for our unsecured lines of credit was calculated using the most recent stated interest rates that were in effect 
our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of owned development projects and third party construction projects 
related party transactions we provide property and asset management  leasing  construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we earned management fees of million  million and million  leasing fees of million  million and million and construction and development fees of million  million and million from these companies 
we recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services  and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we have guaranteed the repayment of million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments 
we will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service 
management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees 
we also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of six of our unconsolidated subsidiaries 
at december   the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately million 
included in our total guarantee exposure is a joint and several guarantee of the construction loan agreement of the peachtree joint venture  which had a carrying amount of million at december  we lease certain land positions with terms extending to december  with a total obligation of million 
no payments on these ground leases are material in any individual year 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term borrowings 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
we have one outstanding swap  which has a fixed rate on one of our variable rate loans  it is not significant to our financial statements in terms of notional amount or fair value at december  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values in thousands and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes

as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time to the extent we are party to interest rate derivatives  and interest rates 
interest expense on our unsecured lines of credit will be affected by fluctuations in libor indices as well as changes in our credit rating 
the interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew  extend or replace our unsecured lines of credit will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment 
at december   the face value of our unsecured debt was billion and we estimated the fair value of that unsecured debt to be billion 
at december   the face value of our unsecured notes was billion and our estimate of the fair value of that debt was billion
