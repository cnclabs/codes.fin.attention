item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of december   we owned and operated or franchised red robin restaurants in states and canada  of which were company owned and were operated under franchise 
for the fiscal year  we plan to open to net new company owned red robin restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open one to two new restaurants 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the following summarizes the operational and financial highlights of fiscal year and our outlook comparable restaurant revenue 
comparable restaurants include those company owned restaurants that have achieved five full quarters of operations during the periods presented 
for those restaurants that entered the comparable restaurant pool during the current year  comparable sales on a year to date basis are calculated only from the period of time the restaurant reaches the full five quarters 
therefore  sales for such a restaurant can be split between comparable and non comparable for year to date comparisons 
for  the restaurants in our comparable base experienced a increase in net sales from these same restaurants in the same period last year 
this increase was driven by a increase in average net guest check  offset by a decrease in guest count 
comparable restaurant gross sales increased 
this was due to a gross increase in average guest check of partially offset by decrease in guest counts 
marketing efforts 
we executed a variety of revenue growth programs during  many of which we will continue in during the first quarter of  we launched red royalty  a loyalty program  in all company owned restaurants 
it has exceeded our expectations to date with over million registered members and we expect it to continue to grow in size and importance in we also implemented happy hour and beverage menu promotions aimed at increasing beverage sales  particularly alcoholic beverages 
we will continue to promote  refresh and expand these programs in in the second quarter of  we completed a nationwide 
table of contents roll out of a new tri fold menu which included a price increase and new featured items 
at the beginning of the fourth quarter  we refreshed the menu and took an additional price increase 
for the year ended december   we realized approximately price impact through these moves 
finally  we continued our limited time offer lto programs supported by national television campaigns through the spring  summer and fall of in  we plan to continue our successful lto strategy  test a refreshed brand prototype and broaden our menu offerings 
advertising spend will be consistent with prior years with increasing emphasis on social media campaigns 
food costs 
as a percentage of restaurant revenue  we have seen an increase in cost of goods during the fiscal year compared to the prior year 
in particular  the cost of ground beef  which comprised approximately of our cost of goods increased approximately for  compared to the prior year and we expect ground beef cost will continue to increase throughout in addition  national and international supply demand imbalances and other factors continue to increase other commodity prices  which will have a continued negative effect on our costs of sales in labor 
labor costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points for the fiscal year from the same period in these decreases were primarily driven by the leverage from our higher average guest check  lower average rate per hour and increased productivity 
many states in which we operate have increased minimum and tip credit wages beginning in we anticipate these wage increases will increase our total labor costs which we may not be able to offset with continued productivity improvements 
new restaurant openings 
we opened new company owned restaurants during fiscal year  including our first test of a limited service non traditional prototype  red robin s burger works 
we plan on opening net new company owned restaurants in including both full service and red robin s burger works restaurants 
we believe we will fund all costs for restaurant development from our operating cash flow 
operating expense initiatives 
operating expenses declined as a percentage of restaurant revenue due to a variety of initiatives undertaken in we believe these initiatives will enable us to sustain the level of operating expenses as a percent of revenue into unit data and comparable restaurant sales the following table details data pertaining to the number of restaurants for both company owned and franchise locations for the years indicated 
company owned beginning of period opened during period acquired from franchisees closed during period end of period franchised beginning of period opened during period a sold or closed during period a end of period total number of red robin restaurants a includes two franchised restaurants that were closed in and re opened during the same year

average weekly sales volumes are based on all restaurants 
net sales are gross sales net of incentives and discounts  primarily related to our loyalty program 
restaurant revenue  which is comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  increased by million  or  from fiscal year revenue in our comparable restaurant base increased approximately million or during this increase was primarily the result of a increase in average guest checks partially offset by decrease in guest counts 
we believe the average increase in guest checks was driven by a combination of our menu price increases  and the nationwide rollout of our tri fold menu  partially offset by discounts including those associated with our red royalty loyalty program 
such discounts increased million from prior year 
revenue for non comparable restaurants contributed an increase of million  primarily all of which was attributed to net sales from restaurants opened since the end of the third quarter of in  restaurant revenue increased million  or  from fiscal year the significant factors contributing to the increase was revenue growth from our restaurant openings 
restaurants not in the comparable sales base experienced a revenue increase of million  of which million was attributable to restaurants opened in average weekly sales volumes represent the total net restaurant revenue for a population of restaurants in both a comparable and non comparable category for each time period presented  divided by the number of operating weeks in the period 
comparable restaurant average weekly sales volumes include those restaurants that are in the comparable base at the end of each period presented 
at the end of the fiscal year and  there were and comparable restaurants  respectively 
non comparable restaurants are primarily restaurants that are open but by definition not included in the comparable category because they have not yet reached the five full quarters of operation 
at the end of fiscal year  there were non comparable restaurants versus at the end of fiscal year fluctuations in average weekly sales volumes for comparable restaurants reflect the effect of same store sales changes as well as the performance of new restaurants entering the comparable base during the period 
franchise royalties and fees consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees 
this revenue increased million or  from the year over year increase in franchise royalties and fees is primarily attributable to the overall increase in reported franchise sales 
our franchisees reported that comparable sales increased for both us restaurants and canadian restaurants in the year ended december  franchise royalties and fees for increased over due primarily to an increase in reported franchise sales 

table of contents other revenue consists primarily of gift card breakage 
we recognize revenue when a gift card is redeemed by a guest 
gift card breakage revenue is recognized if the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balance to the relevant jurisdiction 
we base the gift card breakage rate upon specific historical redemption patterns 
we recognize gift card breakage by applying our estimate of the rate of gift card breakage over the period of estimated performance 
during the first quarter  we recognized  of third party gift card revenue as an initial cumulative program adjustment for gift card sales sold in third party retail locations  while during the first quarter  we recognized million of breakage revenue as an initial cumulative program adjustment for gift cards sold in our restaurants 
we recognized million inclusive of the initial adjustment of gift card breakage during fiscal year we recognized million inclusive of the initial revenue adjustment of gift card breakage for fiscal year costs and expenses cost of sales in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change cost of sales as a percent of restaurant revenue cost of sales  comprised of food and beverage costs  is variable and generally fluctuates with sales volume 
cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased basis points in this increase was driven by an estimated basis points net increase in commodity costs  including ground beef  potatoes  cheese and fry oil and a basis point increase related to change in product mix to higher cost menu items 
these increases were partially offset by a basis point decrease due to the leverage on our higher revenue 
cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased basis points in compared to the increase in food costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue in was driven by a basis point reduction in revenue from our lto promotions pricing  a basis point increase in ground beef costs and a basis point increase in produce costs 
these increases were partially offset by a combined basis point decrease in expenses for bread  fry oil and other meats 
the increase in produce and ground beef was due to higher raw material costs and change in product mix 
labor in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change labor as a percent of restaurant revenue labor costs include restaurant level hourly wages  fixed management salaries  stock based compensation expense  variable compensation  taxes  and benefits for restaurant team members 
in  labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased basis points compared to approximately basis points of this decrease was due to the leverage of our higher average guest check on our fixed labor costs  while approximately basis points decrease was due to increased productivity and lower average hourly wage rates 
these decreases were offset by an approximate basis point increase in payroll taxes related to reduced hiring incentives to restore employment hire act payroll tax benefits realized in 
table of contents labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased in compared to due to an increase in manager variable compensation expense of basis points 
additionally  our lto price promotions and changes in product mix resulted in an approximate basis point increase in labor expenses as a percentage of revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a basis point decrease in hourly wages and a basis point decrease in payroll taxes due to the payroll tax holiday provided by the hire act

during  operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue decrease basis points from the decrease as a percentage of restaurant revenue was due primarily to a combination of basis points leverage from higher restaurant revenue  basis points decrease in repairs and maintenance costs  and basis points decrease in costs of supplies related to initiatives to reduce expenses through better cost management 
during  operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue remained flat compared with contributing to this zero basis point change as a percentage of restaurant revenue was a combination of a basis point deleverage from lowered revenue due to price and product mix changes  an basis point increase in repairs and maintenance expense offset by a basis point decrease in restaurant supplies  and a basis point decrease in miscellaneous costs such as utilities  promotional and other expenses 
occupancy in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change occupancy as a percent of restaurant revenue occupancy costs include fixed rents  contingent rents  common area maintenance charges  real estate and personal property taxes  general liability insurance  and other property costs 
our occupancy costs generally increase with increases in sales volume from contingent rents or the addition of new restaurants  but decline as a percentage of restaurant revenue as we leverage our fixed costs 
in  occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue decreased basis points 
fixed rents for the fiscal year ended and were million and million  respectively  and increased due to the opening of new restaurants 
the decrease of occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue related mainly to the leveraging of fixed costs on higher revenue 
in  occupancy costs as a percent of restaurant revenue decreased basis points compared to this decrease was driven by a basis point decrease in general liability insurance as a percent of restaurant revenue  offset by an increase of fixed rent expense as a percentage of restaurant revenue of basis points 
fixed rents in were million  an increase from million in due to the addition of new restaurants 

table of contents depreciation and amortization in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise rights and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or due  in part  by five year depreciable equipment for restaurants which were open in becoming fully depreciated 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue for the fiscal year  which was driven by leverage from higher restaurant sales volumes on these fixed expenses  as well as  the reduction in depreciation and amortization from assets whose book value was reduced though an impairment charges during the third quarter in  we expect to see an impact from impairments and fully depreciated equipment  partially offset by new restaurant openings 
in  depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  due to three restaurant closures during the fiscal year and the reduction in depreciation and amortization from assets whose book value was reduced through an impairment charge in the fiscal third quarter 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues decreased in due to increased average restaurant sales volumes and a decrease in overall expense 
selling  general and administrative in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change selling  general and administrative as a percent of total revenues selling  general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries  variable compensation  stock based compensation and related employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  office rent  professional and consulting fees  board of directors expenses  legal expenses and marketing costs 
selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or an increase as a percent of total revenues of basis points in due to a million increase in accrued performance based compensation  million in expenses related to infrastructure investments and million increase in legal expenses 
our marketing costs remained steady from in  selling  general and administrative costs increased million  or an increase as a percent of total revenues of basis points in due primarily to an increase of million in the marketing and advertising campaign related to television media support for the spring  summer and fall lto campaigns 
additionally  we also experienced million of additional expense for the ceo transition and million of additional expense for the board of directors and governance related matters 
these increases were partially offset by million decrease in variable compensation at the corporate level and a million decrease in stock compensation related primarily to the options tender offer during the first quarter of fiscal

pre opening costs for   and reflect the opening of   and new restaurants  respectively 
average per restaurant pre opening costs represents total costs incurred for those restaurants that opened for business during the periods presented 
the average per restaurant pre opening costs increased moderately due to higher occupancy costs 
the average per restaurant pre opening costs increased moderately compared to due to increased travel related costs 
asset impairment charge and restaurant closure costs during fiscal year  the company determined that three company owned restaurants were impaired  recognizing a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million 
during fiscal year  the company determined that four company owned restaurants were impaired  and the company recognized a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million resulting from the continuing and projected losses of these restaurants 
the company reviewed each restaurant s past and present operating performance combined with projected future results  primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows  which indicated impairment 
the carrying amount of each restaurant was compared to its fair value as determined by management 
the impairment charge represents the excess of each restaurant s carrying amount over its fair value 
we closed none  three  and four restaurants in fiscal   and  respectively 
in and  one and two  restaurants operating below acceptable profitability levels were closed 
in both and  two restaurants whose leases were not extended or were in need of significant capital improvements that were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future were closed 
we recognized charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  related to lease terminations and other closing related costs 
the three closed restaurants in were not part of the impairment charge taken in the third quarter of fiscal there were no asset impairment charges recognized in 
table of contents interest expense interest expense in   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense was higher in than due to higher weighted average interest rate of versus in partly offset by a lower average debt balance 
interest expense in was lower than due to lower average borrowings under our credit facility partly offset by a slightly higher weighted average interest rate of versus in provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million  to a tax expense of million in  from tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate was  a tax expense  for   a tax benefit  for  and  a tax expense  for the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal is primarily attributable to the increase in earnings before income taxes 
the decrease in versus was primarily due to the impact of more favorable general business and tax credits  primarily the fica tip tax credit  as a percent of current year income  which did not change at the same rate as the decrease in income 
we would expect to see volatility in our tax rate given changes in income before taxes and income tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december   from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this increase in our cash position is primarily the net result of million of cash provided by operating activities  partially offset by million used for the construction of new restaurants  expenditures for facility improvements  investments in it and other  and million used for share repurchases 
we expect to continue to reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or invest in existing restaurants and infrastructure  pay down debt  and maintain the flexibility to use excess cash to opportunistically repurchase our common stock and execute our long term strategic initiatives 
credit facility 
on may   we amended and restated our existing credit facility to provide a more flexible capital structure and facilitate our growth plans 
borrowings under the amended credit agreement may be used by us for general corporate purposes including  among other uses  to repurchase shares of our capital stock  to continue to finance restaurant construction  and for working capital and general corporate requirements 
the amended credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on may  and ii a million term loan maturing on may   both with rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread based on leverage or a base rate plus a spread based on leverage base rate is the highest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus and c libor for an interest period of one month plus 
the amended credit agreement also allows us  subject to lender participation  to increase the revolving credit facility or term loan by up to an additional million in the future 
as part of the amended credit agreement  we may request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility 
the amended credit agreement requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based upon the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the amended credit agreement are secured by first priority liens and security interests in substantially all of our assets  which includes the capital stock of our certain subsidiaries 
additionally  the amended 
table of contents credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
with regard to the term loan facility  we are required to repay the principal amount of the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments which began june   and end on the maturity date of the term loan 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan  and million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings on the revolving facility 
loan origination costs associated with the credit facility and the net outstanding balance of costs related to the original and subsequent amendments to the credit facility are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  in august  we entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with rabobank to hedge the floating interest rate on half of the remaining term loan that was then outstanding under our amended and restated credit facility 
rabobank is rated aaa by standard poor s 
the interest rate swap has an effective date of august   and million of the initial million expired on september   in accordance with its original terms 
the notional amount of the hedge will decrease quarterly based on the required principal term loan payments in the original facility  and will expire on june  with a notional hedge amount of million 
we are required to make payments based on a fixed interest rate of calculated based on the remaining notional amount 
in exchange  we receive interest on the notional amount at a variable rate that was based on the month libor rate 
covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our credit agreement  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  stock repurchases  sales of assets  and dividend payments 
in addition  we are required to maintain two financial ratios a leverage ratio calculated by dividing as our debt outstanding including issued standby letters of credit by the last twelve months earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted for certain non cash charges that will not result in cash payments in a subsequent period  any prepayment penalties incurred as a result of extraordinary debt extinguishment  certain pre opening costs  unusual or non recurring cash losses  net proceeds received from business interruption insurance  pro forma costs savings in connection with an acquisition  divestiture  restructuring or reorganization occurring prior to the time that consolidated ebitda is to be determined  cash or non cash charges related to restructuring or cost reduction initiatives in an aggregate amount not to exceed a certain threshold  and non cash gains and non recurring or unusual cash gains for such period  and a fixed charge ratio calculated as our consolidated cash flow divided by our consolidated debt service obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding decreased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to our scheduled debt repayments of million  as well as payments on our capital lease obligations of approximately  our current credit agreement matures in 
table of contents contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total and thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total contractual obligations long term debt obligations represent minimum required principal payments under our credit agreement including estimated interest of million based on a average borrowing interest rate 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings  and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
excluded are any agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
while we have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot market prices relating to food costs  we do not have any material contracts either individually or in the aggregate in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases 
other noncurrent liabilities include executive deferred compensation  accrued restaurant variable compensation for long term incentive plans  uncertain tax positions  and vendor deposits 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  includes higher expenditures for new restaurants 
fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  includes lower expenditures for new restaurants as well as reductions in facility improvement costs 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to million 
in addition to the construction of new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements 
we will also make significant investments in our data infrastructure including the replacement of several key operational and financial systems 
stock repurchase 
on august   our board of directors authorized a repurchase of up to million of our common stock  which may be made from time to time in open market transactions or through privately negotiated transactions through december  on october   our board of directors re authorized a repurchase of up to million of our common stock through december  this repurchase plan does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time 
there were million shares purchased in with an average purchase price of per share for a total of million 
there were  shares purchased under the plan during the fourth quarter with an average purchase price of 
table of contents per share for a total of million 
the remaining amount that may be purchased under the current board authorization is million 
no shares were repurchased in fiscal years or option tender offer 
during first quarter  we completed a cash tender offer for out of the money stock options held by then current employees 
as a result of the tender offer  we incurred a one time pre tax charge of million for all unvested eligible options that were tendered 
financial condition and future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  support for infrastructure needs  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we have and may continue to use capital to pay principal on our borrowings and repurchase our common stock 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant short term trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affected our labor costs in recent years 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in fiscal year  due primarily to higher costs for certain supplies  and commodity prices for certain foods we purchased at market rates 
our ground beef  which is purchased on the spot market  has consistently been higher than prices  our ground beef costs were approximately higher than uncertainties related to fluctuations in costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  annual indexed wage increases and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during  but it is anticipated that inflation will continue to have a negative impact in fiscal year seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality 
accordingly  results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets  and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  including assumptions on future revenue trends 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model  or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
during  we determined that three company owned restaurants were impaired 
we recognized a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million resulting from the continuing and projected future results of these restaurants  primarily through projected cash flows 
we reviewed each restaurant s past and present operating performance combined with projected future results  primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows  which indicated possible impairment 
we compared the carrying amount of each restaurant s assets to its fair value as estimated by management 
the fair value of the long lived assets was determined using a discounted cash flows projection model that uses several scenarios that estimate expected future cash flows 
the discount factor was determined using external information regarding the risk free rate of return  industry beta factors  and premium adjustments 
these factors were combined with internal information such as our average cost of debt and effective tax rate to determine a weighted average cost of capital which was applied to the undiscounted cash flows 
the impairment charges represent the excess of each restaurant s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
during  we determined that the long lived assets of four company owned restaurants were impaired  and we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million resulting from the continuing and projected losses of these restaurants 
we may record future impairments for restaurants whose operating performance falls below current expectations 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of long lived assets 
we make adjustments to assumptions to reflect management s view of current market and economic conditions and with respect to conditions at specific locations 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we performed step one of the impairment test as of december  step one of the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill balances  to the fair value of our net assets 
fair value is measured using a combination of the market capitalization method  the income approach  and the market approach 
the market capitalization method uses the company s stock price and a control premium to derive fair value 
the income approach consists of utilizing the discounted cash flow method that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs  discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate 
our estimates used in the income approach are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage operations 
the market approach utilizes multiples of profit measures in order to estimate the fair value of the assets 
we do evaluate all methods to ensure reasonably consistent results 
additionally  we evaluate the key input factors in the models used to determine whether a moderate change in any input factor or combination of factors would significantly change the results of the tests 
based on the completion of the step one test  we determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december   as the percentage by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value was approximately 
however  an impairment charge may be triggered in the future  if the value of our stock declines  sales in our restaurants decline  or if there 
table of contents are significant adverse changes in the operating environment of the restaurant industry 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of goodwill 
the company makes adjustments to assumptions to reflect management s view of current market and economic conditions 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  incremental borrowing rates  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for leases in the past three years 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  as well as incurred but not reported claims  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater number of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs or other claim costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient  and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes in our estimates may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported historically under these programs 
we have not made any significant changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account our self insurance liabilities in the past three years 
estimating fair value 
the company has a deferred compensation plan  an associated life insurance policy and derivative financial instruments  which are all carried at fair value 
fair value is defined by accounting guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company s approach to estimating fair value may require the company to make significant judgments regarding inputs into the valuation 
in estimating fair values for derivative financial instruments  the company believes that third party market prices are the best evidence of exit price and where available  bases its estimates on such prices 
all key assumptions and valuations are the responsibility of management 
income taxes 
the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires management s judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
the company establishes contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures relating to deductions  
table of contents transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
the company s reserves reflect its judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
several years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved or clarified 
while the company believes that its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related reserve 
such differences could materially increase or decrease the company s income tax provision in the current and or future periods 
when facts and circumstances change including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration  these reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
to the extent the company determines that it will not realize the benefit of some or all of its deferred tax assets  then these assets will be adjusted through the company s provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 
unearned revenues 
unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed  as well as  deferred revenues related to our loyalty program 
we recognize sales when the gift card is redeemed by the customer 
although there are no expiration dates or dormancy fees for our gift cards  based on our historical gift card redemption patterns  we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote  which is referred to as breakage 
we recognize breakage within other revenue for unused gift card amounts in proportion to actual gift card redemptions  which is also referred to as the redemption recognition method 
the estimated value of gift cards expected to go unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed 
utilizing this method  we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption 
if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates  actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded 
we update our estimate of our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions 
in january  we began rolling out red robin s red royalty program  our smart rewards loyalty program  in all company owned restaurants 
we recognize the current sale of a product and an obligation to deliver future products because a portion of the price paid for a customer s qualifying purchase is assumed to reflect partial pre payment for future goods services that the customer is entitled to obtain 
we will not recognize a portion of the payment as revenue until the customer redeems the earned award or the likelihood of a customer claiming the reward becomes remote 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes or monte carlo for performance based units option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we have not made any changes to the nature of the assumptions used to account for stock based compensation in the past three years  other than an increase in the forfeiture rate we apply to officer grants  due to the recent officer transitions 
during  the company granted performance based restricted stock units psus to executives and other key employees 
these psus contain a market condition based on total shareholder return and measure the overall stock price performance of the company to the stock price performance of a selected industry peer group 
the actual number of psus subject to the awards will be determined at the end of the performance period based on these performance metrics 
the fair value of the psus is calculated using the monte carlo valuation method 
this method utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the market condition and the fair value of the awards 
this method uses judgment and estimation which is the responsibility of management

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued an update regarding guidance over the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements 
this update adds new requirements for disclosure about transfers into and out of levels one and two and also adds additional disclosure requirements about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level three measurements 
the guidance is effective beginning fiscal year for the disclosure requirements around levels one and two measurements  and is effective beginning fiscal year for the disclosure requirements around level three 
this new guidance currently has no impact on the fair value disclosures of the company  as there have been no transfers out of levels one or two 
in may  the fasb issued  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this pronouncement was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
this guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb finalized guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income  which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income oci 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued a deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this defers only the changes that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
these amendments are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb finalized guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our current credit agreement  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate 
table of contents abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the credit agreement is subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates 
a plus or minus change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuation of  on an annualized basis 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we have used an interest rate swap and may use other means such as caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
in august  the company entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with rabobank to hedge the company s floating interest rate on half of the remaining term loan that is currently outstanding under the company s amended and restated credit facility 
the interest rate swap has an effective date of august   and million of the initial million expired on september   in accordance with its original terms 
the notional amount of the hedge will decrease quarterly based on the remaining required principal term loan payments  and will expire on june  with a notional hedge amount of million 
the company is required to make payments based on a fixed interest rate of calculated based on the remaining notional amount  which is half of the outstanding term loan 
in exchange  the company receives interest on the notional amount at a variable rate that was based on the month libor rate 
this hedge is highly effective and there were no gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during as of december   the  unrealized loss  net of taxes  on the cash flow hedging instrument is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
refer to note  derivative and other comprehensive income  of notes to consolidated financial statements of this report 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to significant foreign currency risk 
many of the food products we purchase are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price product purchase commitments which may exclude fuel surcharges and other fees 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
