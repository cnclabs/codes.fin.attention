overview intevac provides process manufacturing equipment solutions to the hard disk drive industry and high productivity process manufacturing equipment and inspection solutions to the photovoltaic pv industry 
intevac also provides sensors  cameras and systems for government applications such as night vision and long range target identification and for commercial applications in the inspection  medical  scientific and security industries 
intevac s customers include manufacturers of hard disk drives and pv cells as well as the us government and its agencies and contractors  medical  scientific and security companies  and law enforcement 
intevac reports two segments equipment and intevac photonics 
during the fourth quarter of  intevac completed the acquisition of the outstanding shares of solar implant technologies  inc sit  a privately owned  development stage company  that was creating a manufacturing module for pv applications 
during the first quarter of  intevac sold certain assets comprising its semiconductor mainframe technology to brooks automation inc brooks 
product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america and asia 
intevac has field offices in asia to support its equipment customers 
intevac s equipment and service products are highly technical and  with the exception of japan  are sold primarily through a direct sales force 
in japan  sales are typically made by intevac s japanese distributor  matsubo 
intevac s results are driven by worldwide demand for hard disk drives  which in turn depends on end user demand for personal computers  enterprise data storage including on line  cloud storage and near line applications  personal video players and video game platforms that include such drives 
demand for intevac s equipment is impacted by intevac s customers relative market share positions and production capacity needs 
intevac continues to execute its equipment diversification strategy into new markets by introducing products for pv solar cell manufacturing 
intevac believes that expansion into this market  which is significantly larger than the hard disk drive deposition equipment market  will result in incremental equipment revenues for intevac and decrease intevac s dependence on the hard disk drive industry 
intevac s business is subject to cyclical industry conditions  as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for hard disk drives and pv cells  as well as other factors such as global economic conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes

in thousands  except percentages and per share amounts net revenues gross profit gross margin percent points points net income loss earnings loss per diluted share fiscal financial results reflected a challenging environment that resulted from the economic slowdown 
demand in the hard disk drive industry was flat compared to fiscal and intevac s equipment customers did not require capacity additions 
during fiscal  demand for new equipment resulted primarily from the retirement of some legacy systems and customer research and development activities  including in patterned media 
at the end of  however  intevac s hard drive customers began taking delivery of and ordering additional systems for capacity needs 
in  intevac photonics business grew  driven by us government spending plus incorporation of intevac products into development  pre production and some early stage production programs 
fiscal financial results significantly improved as intevac s equipment customers took delivery of systems to increase their production capacity in response to the increasing demand for hard drives resulting from a general increasing demand for digital storage in multiple applications 
in fiscal intevac also invested heavily in the development of its pv solar manufacturing products and in late  intevac acquired sit to develop ion implementation systems for pv cell manufacturing 
net revenues during fiscal reflected higher equipment sales to disk manufacturers and increased intevac photonics contract research and development r d and product sales 
net income during fiscal reflected higher net revenues  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses  and higher income tax expense 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during fiscal was primarily a result of variable compensation expenses  legal expenses associated with an arbitration proceeding covering intevac s holdings of auction rate securities ars and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of sit 
fiscal financial results reflected a challenging environment that resulted from consolidations in the hard drive industry  the floods in thailand  and the impact of us government defense budget delays 
net revenues during fiscal reflected lower equipment sales to disk manufacturers and lower intevac photonics contract r d offset in part by higher intevac photonics military product sales 
intevac sold fewer lean systems in fiscal  as intevac s hard drive customers delayed equipment purchases during the extended regulatory approval process for the acquisitions by seagate and western digital 
also intevac s hard drive customers had invested heavily in increased production capacity in the previous year  which met some of their capacity needs 
finally  floods in thailand resulted in supply chain disruptions for intevac s hard drive customers 
during fiscal  intevac also continued its efforts to diversify the equipment business and recognized the first revenue on its pv and semiconductor products 
for fiscal  intevac photonics product revenue from low light sensors and cameras increased  however  contract r d revenue declined as certain r d contracts had been completed in the prior year and contract funding for several large programs was impacted due to delays in us government defense budget approvals 
the fiscal net loss reflected lower net revenues and increased operating expenses from the inclusion of the sit expenses which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  offset in part by reduced variable compensation expenses and recognition of an income tax benefit 
during fiscal  the company did not record compensation expense in association with its profit sharing and executive incentive variable compensation programs as a result of being in a loss position 
in fiscal  intevac expects to see a recovery in the hard drive business in the second half of the year as the pending industry acquisitions are completed and as the industry recovers from the effects of the thailand flooding in the fourth quarter of fiscal intevac continues to believe that long term demand for hard disk drives will increase  driven by growth in demand for digital storage  the need for corporations to replace and update employee computers  increased information technology spending  declining growth rate in areal density improvements and the proliferation of personal computers into emerging economies 
the number of disk manufacturing systems needed to support this growth is expected to vary from year to year depending on the factors noted above 
in fiscal  intevac expects to complete customer qualifications on its pv manufacturing products and start to obtain repeat orders from customers 
during the first quarter of  intevac discontinued offering products to the semiconductor industry and sold certain assets which comprised its semiconductor mainframe technology to brooks 
in fiscal  intevac expects that intevac photonics business levels will grow driven primarily by the recovery of the contract r d business  as several key us defense programs received budgetary funding in the fourth quarter of and the us military continues to develop night vision solutions based on intevac s digital low light sensor technology 
results of operations net revenues years ended december  change vs 
change vs 
in thousands equipment intevac photonics total net revenues net revenues consist primarily of sales of equipment used to manufacture thin film disks and pv cells  and  to a lesser extent  related equipment and system components  revenue from contract research and development related to the development of electro optical sensors  cameras and systems  and sales of low light imaging products and table top and handheld raman instruments 
the decrease in equipment revenues in was due primarily to a decrease in the number of lean systems delivered 
in  intevac delivered three lean systems compared to twenty six lean systems in and four lean systems in during fiscal intevac recognized the first revenue from its pv products 
intevac recognized revenue on the first lean solar deposition system for crystalline silicon solar c si processing applications 
intevac also sold a lean solar system for copper indium gallium di selenide cigs thin film applications whereby revenue is being recognized under the installment method of accounting over the next several years 
during fiscal intevac also recognized revenue from its semiconductor products 
during the first quarter of  intevac discontinued offering products to the semiconductor industry and sold certain assets which comprised its semiconductor mainframe technology to brooks 
revenues from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts decreased in versus as intevac s customers delayed equipment purchases due to the pending industry consolidation as well as reduced need for upgrades in light of the level of new equipment purchased in fiscal revenues from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts increased in versus equipment revenues in are expected to be higher than levels due to increased capital spending by hard drive customers for capacity additions and increased revenue from intevac s new pv equipment products 
intevac believes that once the supply chain constraints which resulted from the thailand floods are lifted  intevac s customers will need new equipment to ramp media capacity  which will result in increased demand for intevac s equipment 
however  because the situation in thailand is still evolving uncertainty remains regarding the ultimate impact of this event on the company 
intevac expects long term demand for hard disk drives to increase driven by the growth in digital storage  the need for corporations to replace and update employee computers  increased information technology spending  declining growth rate in areal density improvements and the proliferation of personal computers into emerging economies 
the number of disk manufacturing systems needed to support this growth can vary from year to year and is dependent on the factors noted above 
intevac photonics revenues decreased by to million in  which consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract r d revenue 
intevac photonics revenues of million in consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract r d revenue 
intevac photonics revenues of million in consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract r d revenue 
the increase in product revenues in both and resulted from higher sales of low light sensors and cameras used in military night vision and long range imaging as well as commercial applications such as intevac s near eye display products 
the decrease in contract r d revenue in was the result of a lower volume of contracts due to the completion of several of intevac photonics large development contracts in and delays in us government defense budget approvals 
the increase in contract r d revenue in was the result of a higher volume of contracts for additional digital night vision applications 
in  intevac photonics revenue is expected to grow as a result of the resumption of us government defense spending and due to the continued expansion of intevac s low light camera and sensor products in military and commercial applications 
substantial growth in future intevac photonics revenues is dependent on the proliferation of intevac s technology into major military programs  continued defense spending  the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers  obtaining production subcontracts for these programs  and intevac s development and market acceptance of commercial products 
intevac s backlog of orders at december  was million  as compared to million at december  and million at december  equipment backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  intevac photonics backlog at december  was million compared to million at december  and million at december  equipment backlog at december  included one lean solar system  as compared to two lean systems and two lean solar systems at december   and ten lean systems at december  significant portions of intevac s revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers 
in  and sales to seagate and hitachi global storage technologies each accounted for more than of intevac s revenues 
in addition  in sales to fuji electric accounted for more than of intevac s revenues 
in the aggregate  sales to these three customers accounted for  and of revenues in  and respectively 
the magnetic disk manufacturing industry consists of a small number of large manufacturers 
seagate acquired maxtor in and samsung s hard disk drive business in western digital acquired komag in  hoya s magnetic media operations in and announced in that it will acquire hitachi global storage technology 
all of these transactions further concentrated the customer base in the industry 
international sales totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively  accounting for   and of net revenues 
the decrease in international sales in was primarily due to decreases in net revenues from disk sputtering systems  and the increase in international sales in was primarily due to increases in net revenues from disk sputtering systems

equipment gross margin was in compared to in and in fiscal gross margins declined over fiscal due to lower volume and unabsorbed factory utilization 
fiscal gross margins improved over fiscal due to higher revenues and improved factory utilization partially offset by a higher proportion of system shipments  which generally have a lower margin than technology upgrades and spare parts 
gross margins in the equipment business vary depending on a number of factors  including product mix  product cost  system configuration and pricing  factory utilization  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
intevac photonics gross margin was in compared in and in the increase in gross margin in resulted primarily from improved margins associated with intevac photonics high volume digital night vision production shipments for a nato customer and lower warranty provisions 
the decrease in gross margin in resulted primarily from lower margins associated with intevac photonics digital night vision product  lower margins on contract r d and increased warranty provisions 
manufacturing costs for the digital night vision product decreased in as a result of cost reductions and yield improvements

research and development spending increased for equipment during as compared to and the increase in equipment spending during was due primarily to increased pv development and the inclusion of sit which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in equipment spending during as compared to was due primarily to a reduction in spending on semiconductor products 
research and development spending increased for intevac photonics during as compared to due primarily to an increase in yield improvement efforts  offset in part by cost containment efforts 
research and development spending decreased for intevac photonics during as compared to primarily related to decreased spending for the digital night vision camera module for intevac s military nato customer as the product transitioned into production 
research and development expenses do not include costs of million  million  and million  in   and  respectively  which are related to customer funded contract r d programs and therefore included in cost of net revenues

all domestic sales and international sales of disk sputtering products in asia  with the exception of japan  are typically made by intevac s direct sales force  whereas sales in japan of disk sputtering products and other products are typically made by intevac s japanese distributor  matsubo  which also provides services such as installation  warranty and customer support 
intevac has offices in singapore  malaysia  taiwan and china to support intevac s equipment customers in asia 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in over the amount spent in due primarily to the reduction in variable compensation accruals offset in part by acquisition related charges and increased equity compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expense include costs of million and  in and  respectively  in charges associated with the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations related to the sit acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in over the amount spent in due primarily to variable compensation  legal expenses associated with the ars arbitration and transaction costs associated with the acquisition of sit  offset in part by lower equity based compensation expense 
impairment of goodwill and intangibles at december   intevac had a total of million of goodwill and million of indefinite life intangible assets 
goodwill in the amount of million is attributed to the equipment segment 
goodwill in the amount of million is attributed to the intevac photonics segment 
goodwill and intevac s indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of circumstances that indicate that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets may be impaired 
in the fourth quarter of  intevac performed its annual assessment of impairment which did not result in an impairment of goodwill or intevac s indefinite life intangible assets 
intevac s reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes are consistent with the reportable segments equipment and intevac photonics 
intevac tested goodwill for possible impairment by first determining the fair value of the related reporting unit and then comparing this value to the recorded net assets of the reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
intevac used two valuation methodologies to determine the fair value for its reporting units  with each approach given equal weighting the income approach and the market approach 
using the income approach  the fair value of each reporting unit was calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows  which were formed by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the businesses are critical to these assessments 
the assumptions used in the fair value calculation included revenue growth rates  operating margins  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
changes in these assumptions based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
the market approach looked at the valuations of comparable public companies which intevac selected based upon similar industries and products 
intevac then evaluated the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of the reporting units by reconciling the total of the fair values of the two reporting units to intevac s total market capitalization  taking into account an appropriate control premium 
intevac compared the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value calculations 
the results of the test for goodwill impairment  as of october   showed that the estimated fair values of the equipment and intevac photonics reporting units exceeded their carrying values by more than million and million  respectively 
there was no impairment of goodwill recorded during the years ended december   and intevac acquired in process research and development ipr d of million in connection with the acquisition of sit in november the fair value of the ipr d was determined through estimates and valuation techniques based on the terms of the acquisition 
this ipr d project is the development of intevac s energi ion implantation process technology module for the lean solar platform to be used in the manufacturing of pv solar cells 
intevac expects to complete development on this project in the second half of fiscal upon completion of development and establishment of technological feasibility  intevac will determine and begin amortization of the acquired ipr d over its useful life 
in conjunction with the annual impairment review  the company assessed the valuation of the ipr d from the sit acquisition 
for ipr d  the review involved determining the present value of future cash flows from the resulting product based on estimates  judgments  and assumptions that management believes are appropriate for the circumstances 
based upon updated management projections related to the ipr d and on a discounted cash flow model  intevac determined the fair value of the ipr d exceeded its carrying value 
intevac also performed the annual impairment review of a tradename  an indefinite life intangible asset  during the fourth quarter of using a discounted cash flow model and the relief from royalty method 
based on this review  intevac determined the fair value of the tradename exceeded its carrying value 
intevac will continue to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and if it is determined that there is a potential impairment  intevac may record additional charges which would adversely affect its financial results

provision for benefit from income taxes years ended december  change vs 
change vs 
in thousands provision for benefit from income taxes intevac s effective income tax provision rate was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal intevac s tax rate differs from the applicable statutory rates due primarily to the utilization of deferred and current credits and the effect of permanent differences and adjustments of prior permanent differences 
intevac s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors including  the level of intevac s projected earnings  the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  net operating loss carryforwards  availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of intevac s tax planning strategies 
management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income tax rate accordingly 
intevac enjoys a tax holiday in singapore through the tax years ending in the tax holiday provides a lower income tax rate on certain classes of income and the agreement requires that certain thresholds of business investment and employment levels be met in singapore in order to maintain this holiday 
as of december   on a worldwide basis intevac has recorded a net deferred tax asset of million 
the realization of the deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on intevac generating sufficient us and foreign taxable income in future fiscal years 
management believes that sufficient positive evidence exists from historical operations and projections of taxable income in future years to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize its deferred tax assets 
management believes that the valuation allowances for intevac s deferred tax assets are adequate based on several factors including degree to which intevac s and losses were attributable to unusual items or charges  long duration of intevac s deferred tax assets  and expectation of improved earnings in the long term 
during  intevac established an additional valuation allowance to fully reserve its california state deferred tax assets due to the impact of california tax legislation that was enacted in february this additional valuation allowance decreased the income tax benefit by million 
intevac recognized the effect of the change in valuation allowance as a discrete item 
business combinations on november   intevac acquired the outstanding shares of solar implant technologies  inc sit  a privately owned  development stage company  developing an ion implant module to be used in the manufacturing of pv solar cells 
intevac s primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement its existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth 
the preliminary aggregate purchase price was million  which consisted of an initial cash payment totaling million and contingent consideration obligations with a fair value of million payable in cash based on the achievement of certain product development milestones achieved over a specified period and revenue earnout on intevac s net revenue from commercial sales of certain products achieved over a specified period 
on july   intevac made million in payments to the selling shareholders for achievement of the first milestone 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance that allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
an entity has the unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
intevac does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends the presentation requirements for comprehensive income in financial statements 
the guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income either as part of a single continuous statement of comprehensive income that would combine the components of net income and other comprehensive income  or in a separate  but consecutive  statement following the statement of income 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is to be applied retrospectively 
intevac does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance that amends the existing requirements for fair value measurement and disclosure 
the guidance expands the disclosure requirements around fair value measurements categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the level in the fair value hierarchy of items that are not measured at fair value in the statement of financial position but whose fair value must be disclosed 
it also clarifies and expands upon existing requirements for measurement of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities as well as instruments classified in stockholders equity 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  intevac does not expect the adoption of these provisions to have a significant effect on its consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at december   intevac had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investments compared to million at december  during fiscal  cash  cash equivalents and investments decreased by million due primarily to cash used by operating activities  payment of acquisition related contingent consideration and purchases of fixed assets partially offset by cash received from the sale of intevac common stock to intevac s employees through intevac s employee benefit plans 
cash  cash equivalents and investments consist of the following december  december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments cash used by operating activities totaled million in cash generated by operating activities totaled million in cash used by operating activities totaled million in lower operating cash flow in was a result of the net loss adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges including  depreciation  amortization  changes in the fair value of acquisition related contingent consideration and equity based compensation 
this decrease in cash from operating activities was partially offset by changes in working capital 
intevac continues to carefully manage working capital 
accounts receivable totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the number of days outstanding for intevac s accounts receivable was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in the receivable balance was due primarily to lower business levels 
the increase in days outstanding was due primarily to lower business levels and customer deposits billed late in net inventories totaled million at december  compared to million at december  inventory turns were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the inventory balance and the decline in turns were due primarily to lower manufacturing activities 
accounts payable totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease of  relates to the decrease in inventory purchases as a result of lower business levels

financing activities generated cash of  in and million in  and used cash of  in in connection with the acquisition of sit  intevac agreed to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash to the selling shareholders if certain milestones are achieved over a specified period 
on july   intevac made million in payments to the selling shareholders of sit for achievement of the first milestone 
subsequent to the sit acquisition  intevac paid in full  in notes payable to certain selling shareholders assumed upon the acquisition 
in  intevac made a scheduled payment of million to the former owners of deltanu 
the sale of intevac common stock to intevac s employees through intevac s employee benefit plans provided million in  million in  and million in on january   the company sold certain assets which comprised its semiconductor mainframe technology for million in cash to brooks automation inc brooks 
intevac s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds  fdic insured corporate bonds  us treasury and agency securities  commercial paper  municipal bonds  corporate bonds and variable rate demand notes vrdns 
intevac regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes measures  which may include the sale of certain securities  to manage such risks in accordance with its investment policies 
as of december   intevac s available for sale securities included million par value of auction rate securities ars  less a temporary valuation adjustment of  to reflect their current lack of liquidity 
management believes that the impairment of the ars investments is temporary 
due to current market conditions  these investments have experienced failed auctions beginning in mid february these failed auctions result in a lack of liquidity in the securities  but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
intevac does not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in these ars will affect its ability to finance its operations and planned capital expenditures 
intevac continues to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
these investments are classified as non current assets until intevac has better visibility as to when their liquidity will be restored 
the classification and valuation of these securities will continue to be reviewed quarterly 
during  intevac participated in three tender offers  sold ars with par values of million  collected million and recognized realized losses on the sales of  additionally  during   of ars were redeemed at par 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the fair value of the ars was estimated at million using discounted cash flow models 
the estimates of future cash flows are based on certain key assumptions  such as discount rates appropriate for the type of asset and risk  which are significant unobservable inputs 
there was insufficient observable market information for the ars held by intevac to determine the fair value 
therefore level fair values were estimated for these securities by incorporating assumptions that market participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
some of these assumptions included credit quality  collateralization  final stated maturity  estimates of the probability of being called or becoming liquid prior to final maturity  redemptions of similar ars  previous market activity for the same investment security  impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates and valuation models 
on july   as a result of a favorable ruling from the financial industry regulatory authority arbitration panel  intevac received million from the repurchase of by citigroup of previously held ars at par including interest 
as of december   approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of investments were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions 
intevac expects a significant portion of these funds to remain off shore in the short term 
if the company chose to repatriate these funds to the united states  it would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 
intevac believes that intevac s existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet intevac s cash requirements for the next months 
intevac intends to undertake approximately million in capital expenditures during the next months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes intevac s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations and commitments other long term liabilities  total  purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on intevac and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
these purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items 
intevac is unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the table above 
total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as current liabilities except other long term liabilities and certain purchase obligations 
total excludes contingent consideration that may be paid pursuant to asset purchases or business combinations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   intevac did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of intevac s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on intevac s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes intevac is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates intevac could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on intevac s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
intevac bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as intevac s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that intevac s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of intevac s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies revenue recognition intevac recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have passed to intevac s customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
intevac s shipping terms are customarily fob shipping point or equivalent terms 
intevac s revenue recognition policy generally results in revenue recognition at the following points for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment  intevac recognizes revenue upon shipment for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  the portion of revenue associated with certain installation related tasks is deferred  and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation related tasks  for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  revenue is recognized at customer acceptance  and for arrangements containing multiple elements  the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred until delivery of the deferred elements 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  intevac allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate of selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
intevac generally utilizes the esp due to the nature of its products 
in certain cases  technology upgrade sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  usually split between delivery of the parts and installation on the customer s systems 
in these cases  intevac recognizes revenue for the relative sales price of the parts upon shipment and transfer of title  and recognizes revenue for the relative sales price of installation services when those services are completed 
revenue related to sales of spare parts is generally recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to services is generally recognized upon completion of the services 
in addition  intevac uses the installment method to record revenue based on cash receipts in situations where the account receivable is collected over an extended period of time and in management s judgment the degree of collectibility is uncertain 
intevac performs research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
revenue on cost plus fee contracts is recognized to the extent of costs actually incurred plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
intevac considers fixed fees under cost plus fee contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs actually incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue on fixed price contracts is recognized on a milestone method or percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
for contracts structured as milestone agreements  revenue is recognized when a specified milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone event is substantive in nature and there is substantial uncertainty about the achievement of the milestone at the inception of the agreement  the milestone payment is non refundable  and there is no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are deferred 
intevac generally determines the percentage completed based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to total estimated costs expected through completion of the contract 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined 
inventories inventories are valued using average actual costs and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
intevac evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on intevac s business  financial condition and results of operations 
warranty intevac estimates the costs that may be incurred under the warranty it provides and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the related revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
intevac s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as intevac s customer service engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
income taxes intevac accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  intevac could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on intevac s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with intevac s expectations could have a material impact on intevac s results of operations and financial condition 
valuation of ipr d  contingent consideration  goodwill and other intangible assets the purchase price of an acquired business is allocated  as applicable  between in process research and development ipr d  other identifiable intangible assets  net tangible assets and goodwill 
ipr d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for ipr d  these valuation methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
contingent consideration is recorded at the acquisition date at the estimated fair value of the contingent payments 
the acquisition date fair value is measured based on the consideration expected to be transferred probability weighted  discounted back to present value 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at the estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recognized as income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including ipr d  of acquired businesses 
intevac s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
intevac assigns assets acquired including goodwill and liabilities assumed to a reporting unit as of the date of acquisition 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
for goodwill  intevac performs a two step impairment test 
in the first step  intevac compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
intevac s reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note  based on the manner in which intevac operates its business and the nature of those operations 
depending on the facts and circumstances intevac determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based upon the most appropriate valuation technique using the income approach  the market approach or a combination thereof 
the income and market approaches were selected as management believes these approaches generally provide the most reliable indications of fair value when the value of the operations is more dependent on the ability to generate earnings than on the value of the assets used in the production process 
under the income approach intevac calculates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach intevac estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies 
each valuation technique has advantages and drawbacks  which must be considered when applying those techniques 
the income approach closely correlates to management s expectations of future results but requires significant assumptions which can be highly sensitive 
the market approach is relatively straightforward to measure  but it may be difficult to find directly comparable companies in the marketplace 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then intevac would perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  intevac would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
no impairment charges were recognized in fiscal  and equity based compensation intevac records compensation expense for equity based awards under accounting standards codification asc  compensation stock compensation  using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires intevac to estimate the expected volatility of the price of intevac s common stock and the expected life of the equity based awards 
asc also requires forfeiture estimates of equity based awards 
estimating volatility  expected life and forfeitures requires significant judgment and an analysis of historical data 
intevac may have to increase or decrease compensation expense for equity based awards if actual results differ significantly from intevac s estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
intevac s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio 
intevac does not use derivative financial instruments in intevac s investment portfolio 
the company has adopted an investment policy and established guidelines relating to credit quality  diversification and maturities of its investments in order to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 
all investment securities in intevac s portfolio have an investment grade credit rating 
investments typically consist of commercial paper  fdic insured corporate bonds  obligations of the us government and its agencies  corporate debt securities  municipal bonds  vrdns and ars 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity for intevac s investment portfolio at december  beyond total fair value in thousands  except percentages cash equivalents fixed rate amounts weighted average rate variable rate amounts weighted average rate short term investments fixed rate amounts weighted average rate variable rate amounts weighted average rate long term investments fixed rate amounts weighted average rate total investment portfolio at december   intevac held investments in ars 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  intevac s ars have experienced multiple failed auctions 
intevac continues to earn interest at the maximum contractual rate for each security 
the estimated values of the ars held by intevac are no longer at par 
as of december   intevac had million in ars in the consolidated balance sheet  which is net of an unrealized loss of  the unrealized loss is included in other comprehensive income  as the decline in value is deemed to be temporary due primarily to intevac s ability and intent to hold these securities long enough to recover their values and that it is more likely than not that intevac would not be required to sell these ars before recovery in their par values 
intevac continues to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of its investments 
if the current market conditions continue  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  intevac may be required to record additional unrealized losses or record an impairment charge in based on intevac s ability to access its cash  its expected operating cash flows  and other sources of cash  intevac does not anticipate that the lack of liquidity of these investments will affect intevac s ability to operate its business in the ordinary course 
foreign exchange risk 
from time to time  intevac enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to economically hedge certain of intevac s anticipated foreign currency transaction  translation and re measurement exposures 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on intevac s operating results 
intevac had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts during any of the years ended december   and
