this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements for a discussion of certain of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our business we are among the larger publicly traded specialty chemical companies in the united states 
we are dedicated to delivering innovative  application focused specialty chemical solutions and consumer products 
our principal executive offices are located in philadelphia  pennsylvania and middlebury  connecticut 
we operate in a wide variety of end use industries  including agriculture  automotive  building and construction  electronics  lubricants  packaging  plastics for durable and non durable goods  pool and spa chemicals and transportation 
the majority of our chemical products are sold to industrial manufacturing customers for use as additives  ingredients or intermediates that add value to their end products 
our agrochemical and consumer products are sold to dealers  distributors and major retailers 
we are a leader in many of our key product lines and transact business in more than countries 
the primary economic factors that influence the operations and sales of our industrial performance products industrial performance and industrial engineered products industrial engineered segments collectively referred to as  industrials are industrial  electronic component and polymer production  residential and commercial construction 
in addition  our chemtura agrosolutions segment is influenced by worldwide weather  disease and pest infestation conditions 
our consumer products segment is also influenced by general economic conditions impacting consumer spending and weather conditions 
for additional factors that impact our performance  see item a risk factors 
other factors affecting our financial performance include industry capacity  customer demand  raw material and energy costs  and selling prices 
selling prices are influenced by the global demand and supply for the products we produce 
we pursue selling prices that reflect the value our products deliver to our customers  while seeking to pass on higher costs for raw material and energy to preserve our profit margins 
overview of our performance we ended having emerged from chapter stronger and more focused on our customers and the industries we serve 
we had strengthened our emphasis on performance and execution  eliminated non value added costs  reduced legacy environmental and litigation exposures and reduced our financial leverage 
we emerged from chapter with a much stronger balance sheet and substantial liquidity 
in  we focused on executing our strategies for growth and in the process quickly returned to profitability 
in our first year following our reorganization we earned per diluted share 
at the core of our strategy is a focus on innovation and growth  particularly in the faster growing regions of the world 
in we introduced new products  offered new and built on existing applications and invested in our businesses to serve our customers growing demand 
among the many accomplishments of are industrial performance we announced our plans to build a new multi purpose manufacturing facility in nantong  china to support the growth in customer demand in the asian region initially producing petroleum additives and urethanes products 
we committed to establish a european manufacturing capability for our synton line of high viscosity polyalphaolefin hvpao synthetic basestocks 
this increased capacity will support our ability to meet the increasing global demand for these products by locating production capacity in a region of significant demand growth  and will enhance our service levels to continue to meet our customer commitments 
engineering work has commenced to enable production in of the synton and synton hvpao products at our facility in ankerweg  amsterdam  the netherlands 
industrial engineered we continued the launch of our emerald tm range of flame retardants 
we introduced emerald tm  based on technology we licensed from the dow chemical company  for use in xps and eps foams 
we continued the introduction of emerald tm and introduced emerald tm which are used in the electronics market 
we are adding capacity for diethylzinc  triethylaluminum  and trimethylaluminum for organometallics 
demand for diethylzinc in pharmaceutical and solar applications outweighs supply 
trimethylaluminum is a building block for materials used in high brightness leds 
we formed the daystar joint venture in korea with up chemical co 
ltd 
so we can better serve the fabricators of high brightness leds 
we entered into a letter of intent with archean group to establish a strategic alliance in bromine and brominated derivatives in india 
consumer products we developed and registered a new range of opening price point products and introduced the pool essentials tm brand 
chemtura agrosolutions we formed the isem srl joint venture in italy with isagro srla to accelerate the development of our new product pipeline 
we appointed bayer crop science as the distributor of our seed enhancement products in the republic of china 
we obtained new product registrations and sourced new products for the expected introduction of at least new products in the need to make significant investments to support the growth in demand for many of our customer applications combined with the relentless increases in raw material input costs required us to place focus on increasing selling prices within our industrial segments in like many industrial businesses  growth slowed in the second half of as customers tried to digest the changing perspectives on economic growth and the possible impacts of the european sovereign debt issues 
nevertheless  despite this uncertainty  we delivered significant year on year improvement in each of the four quarters of as we look to  we will continue to invest in people  capital expenditures and technology as we did in to further drive growth and improved profitability

despite increased economic uncertainty and weaker electronics demand in the second half of the year  net sales volumes increased by million year on year 
sales volume growth was generated by our industrial performance and chemtura agrosolutions segments  with sales volume decreases in our industrial engineered and consumer products segments 
the volume decline in our consumer products segment reflected the loss of a pool and spa mass market customer for the season 
additionally  we benefited from million in favorable foreign currency translation  primarily due to the strength of the euro in the first half of the year 
these increases were offset by a million reduction in sales as a result of the natural sodium sulfonates and oxidized petrolatum product lines in the third quarter of our gross profit as a percentage of net sales for remained constant at despite significant increases in our raw material and distribution costs 
gross profit for increased by million over to million 
increased selling prices generated a million benefit  partially offset by a million increase in raw material and energy costs coupled with million and million in higher manufacturing and distribution costs  respectively 
raw material costs in all of our segments experienced significant increases 
higher manufacturing costs in our industrials segments were due to lower production volumes in the second half of the year  higher maintenance cost  certain weather related plant outages in the third quarter and the relocation of certain manufacturing assets 
we had a million benefit from increased sales volumes and changes to our sales mix largely in our industrial performance segment which were only partially offset by declines in our consumer products segment 
gross profit increased by million as a result of the favorable effects of selling our products in currencies other than the us dollar  but was offset in part by a million reduction due to a divestiture in the third quarter of and a million increase in other costs

we recorded impairment charges of million in and million in the charge included the impairment of intangible assets of our chemtura agrosolutions segment and property  plant and equipment related to our el dorado  arkansas facility 
the charge included the impairment of goodwill within the chemtura agrosolutions segment  resulting from weaker industry demand due to the global economic recession 
these factors resulted in reduced expectations for future cash flows resulting in lower estimated fair values for the respective assets 
changes in estimates related to expected allowable claims were million for compared with million for these charges included adjustments to liabilities subject to compromise  primarily legal and environmental reserves  which were identified in the chapter claim evaluation and settlement processes 
recoveries from insurance carriers were included in these changes in estimates once contingencies related to coverage disputes with the insurance carriers were resolved and coverage was deemed probable 
we recorded million in related to insurance recoveries 
the decrease in activity in is due to the confirmation of the plan in november leaving just a number of disputed claims to be resolved

the increased demand was predominately in the first half of the year and weakened in the second half of the year as general economic conditions softened 
we saw significant increases in raw material costs throughout the year and higher manufacturing costs due to production issues experienced in the first half of increases in sales volumes and the cost of fuel surcharges resulted in higher distribution costs over last year 
the increase in these costs were effectively covered by selling price increases in all businesses throughout the year 
we continued to focus our efforts in providing value added products and services and invested our capital in the addition of resources in our sales and technology areas to support our research and development efforts and offer improved customer support 
in the third quarter of  this segment divested its natural sodium sulfonates and oxidized petrolatum product lines 
the industrial performance segment reported net sales of billion in  a million improvement over this growth was primarily driven by an million benefit from higher selling prices and a million benefit from increased sales volume 
the segment also benefitted from favorable foreign currency translation of million

operating income was reduced by million due to the divestiture of our natural sodium sulfonates and oxidized petrolatum product lines in the third quarter of industrial engineered products our industrial engineered segment reported overall lower volumes in compared with due primarily to weaker demand in the second half of the year 
the lower volumes were the result of reduced demand for flame retardants used in printed wiring boards in the electrical and electronics industries and lower demand for tin based organometallics products 
sales volumes for our other organometallic products showed solid increases versus the prior year 
the segment experienced significant increases in raw material costs throughout the year  higher manufacturing costs due to lower plant production volumes and higher plant maintenance costs  increased distribution costs due to rate increases and higher sga r expense in sales and technology to support our growth initiatives 
this segment aggressively increased selling prices throughout to cover these cost increases as well as to support the required capacity reinvestments to ensure a sustainable and reliable supply of products to our customers 
the segment also benefited from the non recurring expense incurred in related to accelerated depreciation in our el dorado  arkansas facility 
net sales for the industrial engineered segment were million in the million increase from the prior year was largely the result of million in higher selling prices  million in favorable foreign currency translation on products sold in currencies other than the us dollar  partially offset by million in volume reductions

g we have ongoing environmental liabilities for future remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation 
we estimate that the ongoing environmental liability could range up to million 
we have recorded a liability for ongoing environmental remediation of million at december  h we have post retirement health care plans that provide health and life insurance benefits to certain retired and active employees and their beneficiaries 
these plans are generally not pre funded and expenses are paid by us as incurred  with the exception of certain inactive government related plans that are paid from plan assets 
i we have recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million at december  which do not reflect competent authority offsets of million  which are reflected as assets in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits 
during  we made payments of million and million for operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations  respectively 
we fund our defined benefit pension plans based on the minimum amounts required by law plus additional voluntary contribution amounts we deem appropriate 
estimated future funding requirements are highly dependent on factors that are not readily determinable 
these include changes in legislation  returns earned on pension investments  labor negotiations and other factors related to assumptions regarding future liabilities 
in  we made contributions of million to our domestic and international pension plans and million to our post retirement benefit plans including payments made by us directly to plan participants 
see critical accounting estimates below for details regarding current pension assumptions 
to the extent that current assumptions are not realized  actual funding requirements may be significantly different from those described below 
the following table summarizes the estimated future funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans under current assumptions funding requirements by period in millions qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans as previously disclosed  on december   the uk pensions regulator issued a warning notice to us  stating their intent to request authority to issue a financial support direction against us for the support of the benefit obligations under one of our uk pension plans 
our uk subsidiary that is responsible for this plan has entered into definitive agreements with the trustees of that plan over the terms of a recovery plan which provided for a series of additional cash contributions to be made to reduce its underfunding over time and the uk pensions regulator withdrew the warning notice 
the agreements provided  among other things  for our uk subsidiary to make cash contributions of million approximately million in just over a three year period  with the initial contribution of million million made in the second quarter of the agreements also provide for the granting of both a security interest and a guarantee to support certain of the liabilities under this pension plan 
obligations associated with these payments have been included in the above funding table 
there is also an evaluation being undertaken as to whether additional benefit obligations exist in connection with the equalization of certain benefits under the uk pension plan that occurred in the early s 
based on the results of the evaluation to date  million of expense has been recorded in the fourth quarter of  which may be subject to adjustment as further information is gathered as part of the evaluation 
upon completion of the evaluation and the finalization of the liability with respect to additional benefit obligations  additional cash contributions to the uk pension plan may be required starting in we have substantial us net operating losses nols as described in note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements 
while our utilization of these nols is subject to annual federal nol limitations under internal revenue code irc section  we expect they will substantially reduce the amount of us cash tax payments we are required to make in the foreseeable future

strategic initiatives we continually review each of our businesses  individually and as part of our portfolio to determine whether to continue in  consolidate  reorganize  exit or expand our businesses  operations and product lines 
in each case  we examine whether  on a short term or long term basis  the business  operation or product line constitutes a strategic fit with our products  contributed to our financial health and will achieve our business objectives 
if it does not  we will implement initiatives which may include  among other things  limiting or exiting the business  operation or product line  consolidating operations or facilities or selling or otherwise disposing of the business or asset 
our review process also involves expanding businesses  investing in innovative and regional growth  product lines and bringing new products to market or changing the way do business 
the following items are the result of our newly implemented and proposed business initiatives during on january   we announced the formation of isem srl isem  a strategic research and development alliance with isagro spa  which will provide us access to two commercialized products and accelerate the development and commercialization of new active ingredients and molecules related to our chemtura agrosolutions segment 
isem is a joint venture between us and isagro spa and is being accounted for as an equity method investment 
our investment in the joint venture was million million  which was made in january in addition  we and isagro spa have agreed to jointly fund discovery and development efforts for isem  which is expected to amount to approximately million per year from each partner for five years  which began in we will fund our contributions in part by a reduction in our planned direct research and development spending starting in on february   we announced the formation of daystar materials  llc daystar  a joint venture with up chemical co 
ltd 
that will manufacture and sell high purity metal organic precursors for the rapidly growing led market in our industrial engineered products segment 
daystar materials  llc is a joint venture and is being accounted for as an equity method investment 
we made cash contributions of million in  in accordance with the joint venture agreement 
on may   we announced the signing of a letter of intent with archean group to establish a strategic alliance in bromine and brominated derivatives in india 
this alliance is expected to strengthen the brominated performance products business of our industrial engineered products segment by providing it with a strong position to respond to customer demand from a cost competitive and consistent indian supply 
on june   we announced our intent to build a new multi purpose manufacturing facility in nantong  china to support our growth strategy for the asia pacific region 
this new manufacturing capacity will initially serve the petroleum additives and urethanes businesses within our industrial performance segment  and will allow us to serve the growing regional demand for these product lines 
on july   we announced our plan to establish a european manufacturing capability for our synton line of high viscosity polyalphaolefin hvpao synthetic basestocks 
this increased capacity will support our ability to meet the increasing global demand for these products by locating production capacity in a region of significant demand growth  and will enhance our service levels to continue to meet our customer commitments 
engineering work has commenced to enable production of the synton and synton hvpao products at our facility in ankerweg  amsterdam  the netherlands in on november   we sold our interest in tetrabrom technologies ltd 
for net consideration of million 
the consideration will be paid in equal annual installments over a three year period 
the first payment is due in april a pre tax gain of million was recorded on the sale 
reorganization items we recorded million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we incurred substantial expenses resulting from our chapter cases 
such amounts are presented as reorganization items  in our consolidated statements of operations and represent the direct and incremental costs related to our chapter cases such as professional fees  net  impacts related to the resolution of claims in the chapter cases and rejections or terminations of executory contracts and real property leases 
we will continue to incur reorganization related expenses in primarily for professional fees  but at a much reduced amount until all outstanding claims are resolved 
for additional information on reorganization items  net  see note emergence from chapter in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
guarantees in addition to the letters of credit of million and million outstanding at december  and  respectively  we have guarantees that have been provided to various financial institutions at december  and  of million and million  respectively 
the letters of credit and guarantees were primarily related to insurance obligations  environmental obligations  banking credit facilities  vendor deposits and european value added tax vat obligations 
we also had million and million of third party guarantees at december  and  respectively  for which we have reserved million and million at december  and  respectively  which representing the probability weighted fair value of these guarantees 
in addition  the company has a financing agreement with a bank in brazil for certain customers under which the company receives funds from the bank at invoice date  and in turn  the customer agrees to pay the bank on the due date 
the company provides a full recourse guarantee to the bank in the event of customer non payment 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
accounting estimates and assumptions described in this section are those we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
for all of these estimates  we note that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following discussion summarizes our critical accounting estimates 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are discussed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
carrying value of goodwill and long lived assets we have elected to perform our annual goodwill impairment procedures for all of our reporting units in accordance with asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill asc as of july  or sooner  if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units utilizing income and market approaches through the application of discounted cash flow and market comparable methods level inputs as described in note financial instruments and fair value measurements 
the assessment is required to be performed in two steps step one to test for a potential impairment of goodwill and  if potential impairments are identified  step two to measure the impairment loss through a full fair value allocation of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit utilizing the acquisition method of accounting 
we continually monitor and evaluate business and competitive conditions that affect our operations and reflect the impact of these factors in our financial projections 
if permanent or sustained changes in business or competitive conditions occur  they can lead to revised projections that could potentially give rise to impairment charges 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
see note restructuring and asset impairment activities in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we are involved in environmental matters of various types in a number of jurisdictions 
a number of such matters involve claims for material amounts of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities  including cleanup costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites and natural resource damages 
as part of the chapter cases  under the plan  the debtors retained responsibility for environmental cleanup liabilities relating to currently owned or operated sites ie sites that were part of the debtors estates and  with certain exceptions  discharged or settled liabilities relating to formerly owned or operated sites ie sites that were no longer part of the debtors estates and third party sites ie sites that never were part of the debtors estates 
each quarter  we evaluate and review estimates for future remediation  operation and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site where the cost of remediation is probable and reasonably estimable  we determine the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by us and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
at sites where we expect to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures  we accrue on an undiscounted basis for a period of generally years  those costs which are probable and reasonably estimable 
as of december   our reserve for ongoing environmental remediation activities totaled million 
we estimate that ongoing environmental liabilities could range up to million at december  our ongoing reserves include estimates for determinable clean up costs 
at a number of these sites  the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable 
in addition  it is possible that our estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken  current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted 
we intend to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
the resolution of environmental matters asserted against us could require us to pay remedial costs or damages  which are not currently determinable  that could exceed our present estimates  and as a result could have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension and other post retirement benefits expense as part of our financial restructuring under chapter  we proposed reductions in the caps on the level of domestic postretirement medical benefits a group of retirees  the uniroyal salaried retirees  which the modifications have not yet been approved by the bankruptcy court and are therefore not reflected in the financial position  or in any of the estimates presented in this discussion 
in november  we reached an agreement in principle with the steering committee of the uniroyal salaried retirees  resolving all disputes concerning our motion requesting authorization to modify certain post retirement welfare benefits 
the agreement in principle remains subject to documentation  execution by the parties and bankruptcy court approval upon notice to all uniroyal salaried retirees 
for more information about the proposed settlement  see note pension and other post retirement plans in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our calculation of pension and other post retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  mortality rates  expected salary and wage increases  and other relevant factors 
components of pension and other post retirement benefits expense include interest and service costs on the pension and other post retirement benefit plans  expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations 
actual results that differ from the assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and other post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
pension plans pension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities 
at december   we utilized a discount rate of for our domestic qualified pension plan compared to at december  for the international and non qualified plans  a weighted average discount rate of was used at december   compared to used at december  as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in less than a million decrease in pre tax earnings for domestic discount rates adopted at december  utilized an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to guidance codified under asc topic  defined benefit plans asc 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
we discounted the annual cash flows of our domestic pension plans using this yield curve and developed a single point discount rate matching the respective plan s payout structure 
a similar approach was used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans 
the actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single point discount rate to match the respective plan s benefit disbursements 
our weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was for applicable domestic and international pension plans combined at december  as a sensitivity measure  an increase of basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre tax earnings for by an immaterial amount 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy  historical experience  and expectations for long term rates of return 
we determine the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to our target asset allocation 
we utilized a weighted average expected long term rate of return of on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of for the international plan assets for the year ended december  historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices  such as the s p  for the major asset classes 
we looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices  assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset allocation for the domestic plans over several business cycles  to obtain an indication of the long term historical market performance 
the arithmetic average return over the past years was  and over the past years it was 
both of these values exceeded the domestic expected return on assets 
the high volatility of stock markets as well as the drop in bond yields in impacted the investment performance of our pension plan assets 
the actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the months ended december  was approximately net of investment expenses  which was above the expected return on asset assumption for the year 
the international plans realized a weighted average return of approximately in local currency terms and approximately in us dollar terms 
this resulted in currency losses of approximately million on plan assets  which were partially offset by currency gains of approximately million on benefit obligations for the international pension arrangements 
our target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing of plan assets in equity instruments  of plan assets in fixed income investments and in real estate 
at december   of the portfolio was invested in equities  in fixed income investments and in real estate and other investments 
we have unrecognized actuarial losses relating to our pension plans which have been included in our consolidated balance sheet  but not in our consolidated statements of operations 
the extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism the market related value as defined by asc topic  defined benefit plans pensions asc  or through amortization in pre tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a amortization corridor  as defined by asc  which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career or life 
the amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of december  will result in a million decrease to pre tax earnings for million for the qualified domestic plans and million for the international and non qualified plans 
since future gains and losses beyond are a result of various factors described herein  it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization 
at the end of  unrecognized net losses amounted to million for the qualified domestic plans and million for the international and non qualified plans 
of these amounts  million of unrecognized gains for the domestic plans and million of unrecognized losses for the international plans are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism as required by asc the pre tax pension expense for all pension plans was million in pension income expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases 
actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods 
the following table estimates the future pension expense  based upon current assumptions pension expense income by year in millions qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans the following tables show the impact of a basis point change in the actual return on assets on the pension income expense 
change in pension expense income by year increase decrease basis point increase in investment returns qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans increase decrease basis point decrease in investment returns qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans other post retirement benefits we provide post retirement health and life insurance benefits for current retired and active employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents for certain domestic and international employee groups 
the discount rates we adopted for the valuation of the post retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans 
at december   we utilized a weighted average discount rate of for post retirement health care plans  compared to at december  as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in less than a million impact in pre tax earnings for assumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends  considering such factors as health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and the overall health of plan participants 
we use health care trend cost rates starting with a weighted average initial level of for the domestic arrangements and grading down to an ultimate level of 
for the international arrangements  the weighted average initial rate is  grading down to 
the pre tax post retirement healthcare expense was million in the following table summarizes projected post retirement benefit expense based upon the various assumptions discussed above 
in millions pre tax expense by year domestic and international post retirement benefit plans income taxes income taxes payable reflect our current tax provision and management s best estimate of the current tax liability relating to the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
if the actual outcome of uncertain tax positions differs from our best estimates  an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required  which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
we also record deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when we determine that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
thus  changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to our valuation allowances 
we consider undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested in their operations 
at december   such undistributed earnings amounted to million 
as a result of our emergence from chapter in  and the significant reduction in debt  we have determined that we will no longer need to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to fund us operations 
also  we have plans to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely 
as such  the amount of foreign subsidiaries undistributed earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in their foreign operations has increased 
the effect of such change in the year ended december  is a reduction of million in us deferred income tax liability on such undistributed earnings 
in  this reduction in us taxes on unremitted foreign earnings has been offset by an equal increase in the valuation allowance related to us deferred tax assets  and as such had no net effect on tax expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
repatriation of undistributed earnings  currently deemed indefinitely reinvested  would require us to accrue and pay taxes in the future 
estimating the tax liability that would arise if these earnings were repatriated is not practicable at this time 
we file income tax returns in the u 
s including federal and state and foreign jurisdictions 
the income tax returns for our entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment 
we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the economic benefit associated with a tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position ultimately will be sustained 
we adjust these liabilities  if necessary  upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 
we have a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily related to a foreign tax matter dating back to the s

outlook our vision is to create a focused portfolio of global specialty chemical businesses that provide sustainable competitive advantage and continued growth opportunities through superior innovation  reliability  and applied science  making chemtura indispensable to its stakeholders 
we will deliver continuous value accreting growth by leveraging our in depth knowledge and expertise in the electronics and energy  transportation and agriculture industries  achieving geographic balance through investment in the faster growing regions and utilizing a systematic process of product and application innovation and extension 
we ended with our industrial segments experiencing softer demand condition and experiencing reduced demand from the electronics industry  particularly in the production of printed wiring boards 
demand from our industrial customers so far in has been comparable to what we saw in the second half of and we have not yet seen recovery in the electronics markets 
we expect industrial demand to begin to recover before summer and then build in the second half of the year 
in this environment  the challenge for our industrial segments will be to match performance in the first half of and then surpass in the second half of the year 
our industrial segments expect to deliver improvement for as a whole 
a more positive economic environment will provide more rapid performance improvement 
we expect stronger performance from our consumer products and chemtura agrosolutions segments in our consumer products segment has regained the mass market customer it lost for the season and introduced new products and brands 
the anticipated increase in sales volume is expected to drive stronger performance in chemtura agrosolutions has extended its product offerings  gained new product registrations and strengthened its distribution channels 
the resulting new product introductions in is expected to drive further recovery by this segment over that achieved in with the benefit of these performance trends  we expect to be another year of improvement  keeping us on track to achieve our objective of step change growth in both revenue and profitability
