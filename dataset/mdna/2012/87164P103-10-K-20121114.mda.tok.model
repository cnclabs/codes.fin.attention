overview synergy resources corporation we  our  us or the company is a growth oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development  and production of crude oil and natural gas in and around the denver julesburg basin d j basin of colorado 
all of our producing wells are in the wattenberg field  which has a history as one of the most prolific production areas in the country 
during  we expanded our undeveloped acreage holdings in eastern colorado and western nebraska  and may commence development activities in these areas 
since commencing active operations in september  we have undergone significant growth 
as disclosed in the following table  as of august   we have drilled  acquired  or participated in gross oil and gas wells and have successfully completed wells that were in production 
there were wells in progress at august  operated participated year drilled completed drilled completed acquired total as of august   we were the operator of wells that were producing oil and gas and the operator of wells that were in the completion process and we were participating as a non operating working interest owner in producing wells and wells that were in progress  held approximately  gross acres and  net acres under lease  and had estimated proved reserves of million barrels bbls of oil and billion cubic feet bcf of gas 
estimated boe proved reserves increased during the fiscal year  primarily as a result of the success achieved under the drilling program 
our strategy for continued growth includes additional drilling activities  acquisition of existing wells  and recompletion of wells to more rapidly access and or extend reserves through improved hydraulic stimulation techniques 
we attempt to maximize our return on assets by drilling and operating wells in which we have a majority net revenue interest 
we attempt to limit our risk by drilling in proven areas 
to date  we have not drilled any dry holes 
all wells drilled prior to were relatively low risk vertical or directional wells 
however  the increased pace of horizontal drilling activity in the d j basin by numerous operators has provided us with the opportunity to witness best practices in the industry first hand 
consequently  we agreed to participate in our first horizontal well  which began drilling operations in january and commenced production in march the introduction of horizontal drilling to the d j basin has accelerated the retrieval of natural gas reserves in the niobrara shale and codell formations 
we subsequently agreed to participate in additional horizontal wells 
by the end of august  we were a participant in three horizontal wells that were in production  two wells that were in the completion phase and one well that was in the drilling phase 
we expect to participate in additional horizontal wells and we are preparing to drill and operate horizontal wells for our own account during our fiscal year 
historically  our cash flow from operations was not sufficient to fund our growth plans and we relied on proceeds from the sale of debt and equity securities 
our cash flow from operations is increasing  and we plan to finance an increasing percentage of our growth with internally generated funds 
ultimately  implementation of our growth plans will be dependent upon the success of our operations and the amount of financing we are able to obtain 
results of operations material changes of certain items in our statements of operations included in our financial statements for the periods presented are discussed below 
for the year ended august   compared to the year ended august for the year ended august   we reported net income of  or per share  per diluted share  compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the period ended august  our rapid improvement in profitability was driven by our successful drilling program 
the significant variances between the two years are i increased revenues and expenses associated with more producing wells  ii the cessation of certain interest and other non cash expenses  and iii the effect of income taxes 
as further explained below  our net loss for resulted from non cash charges related to the convertible promissory notes and the derivative conversion liability 
the following discussion also expands upon items of inflow and outflow that affect operating income 
oil and gas production and revenues for the year ended august   we recorded total revenues of  compared to  for the year ended august   an increase of  or 
we experienced an overall annual increase in production from the prior year having realized a full year of production from wells at the beginning of the year  and the addition of wells  including new wells drilled as well as those acquired 
although there was significant commodity price fluctuation during the year  overall pricing on a boe basis was not significantly different from to for the fiscal year ended august   our gas oil ratio gor on a boe basis was compared to for the fiscal year ended august  year ended august  production oil bbls gas mcf total production in boe revenues oil gas total average sales price oil bbls gas mcf boe bbl refers to one stock tank barrel  or us gallons liquid volume in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons 
mcf refers to one thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
boe refers to barrel of oil equivalent  which combines bbls of oil and mcf of gas by converting each six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil 
as of august   we had producing wells 
net oil and gas production averaged  boe per day in  as compared with boe per day for  a year over year increase of in boepd production 
the significant increase in production from the prior year reflects additional wells that went into productive status since august  and a full year of production from the wells that were added over the course of fiscal year production for the fourth fiscal quarter of averaged  boe per day 
revenues are sensitive to changes in commodity prices 
from to  our realized annual average sales price per barrel of oil rose  however  we experienced a decline of in our realized annual average sales price per mcf of natural gas 
there was a and swing in the price of crude and natural gas from the respective low to high prices during the twelve month period ended august  barrel and mcf prices at year end were up and down  respectively  from twelve month average 
we did not utilize any commodity price hedges during either year  but expect to do so in the future 
while our balanced production mix of oil and gas and the high liquid content of our gas help to mitigate the negative effect of volatility in commodity prices  downward price pressure could have a negative effect on revenues reported in future periods 
lease operating expenses loe and production taxes direct operating costs of producing oil and natural gas and taxes on production and properties are reported as lease operating expenses as follows year ended august  production costs work over other lifting cost severance and ad valorem taxes total loe per boe production costs work over other lifting cost severance and ad valorem taxes total loe per boe lease operating and work over costs tend to fluctuate with the number of producing wells  and  to a lesser extent  on variations in oil field service costs and changes in the production mix of crude oil and natural gas 
from to  we experienced an increase in production cost per boe in connection with additional costs to bolster output from some of our older wells 
taxes  the largest component of lease operating expenses  generally move with the value of oil and gas sold 
as a percent of revenues  taxes averaged in both and depletion  depreciation and amortization dda we recognized dda expense of  and  for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively  of which  and  was the depletion of oil and gas properties for compared to depletion expense more than doubled  primarily as a result of growth in production and producing properties from to capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties are depleted quarterly using the units of production method based on estimated reserves  wherein the ratio of production volumes for the quarter to beginning of quarter estimated total reserves determine the depletion rate 
for fiscal year  our depletable reserve base was  barrels of oil and  mcf of natural gas 
fiscal year production represented and of those reserve bases  respectively 
depletion expense per boe declined from to for the fiscal year ended august   depletion of oil and gas properties was per boe compared to for the fiscal year ended august  during  we have been able to increase reserves and production faster than the increase in capitalized costs  which caused the decline in the expense per boe 
general and administrative g a the following table summarizes the components of general and administration expenses year ended august  cash based compensation share based compensation professional fees insurance other general and administrative capitalized general and administrative total g a although g a costs increased during  they increased at a lower rate than the overall growth of our business  as we strive to maintain an efficient overhead structure 
for the fiscal year ended august   g a was per boe compared to for the fiscal year ended august  cash based compensation and benefits include payments to employees and directors 
share based compensation is associated with compensation in the form of either stock options or common stock grants for employees  directors  and service providers 
the amount of expense recorded for stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model  while the amount of expense recorded for common stock grants is calculated based upon the closing market value of the shares on the date of grant 
professional fees have increased as we have grown our business 
the two primary factors driving this increase are the additional accounting and auditing fees incurred in connection with operating as a public company  and the additional professional services required to meet the compliance requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  as we have progressed from a smaller reporting company to an accelerated filer under sec definitions 
the listing on the nyse mkt contributed to costs in excess of those reported in the comparable prior year period when our stock was listed on the otc bulletin board 
pursuant to the requirements under the full cost accounting method for oil and gas properties  we identify all general and administrative costs that relate directly to the acquisition of undeveloped mineral leases and the development of properties 
those costs are reclassified from general and administrative expenses and capitalized into the full cost pool 
the increase in capitalized costs from to reflects our increasing activities to acquire leases and develop the properties 
operating income loss for the year ended august   we generated operating income of  compared to  for the year ended august  this tri fold increase in operating income resulted primarily from the increasing contribution of wells brought into production during the last two years  which includes wells drilled under the and drilling programs  the acquisition of producing properties from pem and other parties  and increased production from older wells that were recompleted using newer hydraulic fracturing techniques 
increased revenues more than offset increased costs incurred by us to accomplish these objectives 
other income expense other income for the fiscal year ended august  was  consisting solely of interest income 
interest cost of  was incurred during  all of which was capitalized as part of the cost of oil and gas properties 
for the fiscal year ended august   we reported several significant items of expense in addition to interest income of  these other expenses reported in primarily related to our convertible promissory notes  including net interest expense of  accretion of debt discount of  amortization of debt issuance costs of  and a change in the fair value of the derivative conversion liability of  during  interest expense was also recorded on the related party note and the bank line of credit in the amounts of  and  respectively 
of these expenses  we capitalized interest and amortization of  the convertible promissory notes contained a conversion feature which was considered an embedded derivative and recorded as a liability at its initial estimated fair value 
this derivative conversion liability was then marked to market over time  with the resulting change in fair value recorded as a non cash item in the statement of operations 
all expenses related to the convertible promissory notes ceased mid year  as all noteholders converted their holdings into equity 
income taxes we reported income tax expense of  offset by a tax benefit of  for the fiscal year ended august   resulting in a net income tax benefit of  and a corresponding net deferred tax asset in the same amount 
for all reporting periods prior to  no income tax expense or benefit was reported  as all tax assets or liabilities were effectively offset by a valuation allowance 
the income tax benefit is a one time event representing the expected value of the future deduction of the net operating loss carry forward generated during our start up years 
each year  management evaluates all the positive and negative evidence regarding our tax position and reaches a conclusion on the most likely outcome 
during the current fiscal year  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a benefit from the net operating loss carry forward  and we released our entire valuation allowance of  prior to  management concluded that it was more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  a full valuation allowance was provided against the net deferred tax asset 
during management concluded that positive indicators outweighed negative indicators and that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance 
although we reported net losses every year since inception through august   we attributed all of the net losses for the and fiscal years to a single discrete item 
the discrete item was the fair value accounting treatment of the components of the convertible promissory notes issued in  which created non cash expenses for accretion of debt discount  amortization of issuance costs  and change in fair value of derivative liability 
as all of the convertible notes were converted  those expenses will not recur  and it is appropriate to exclude them from a consideration of future profitability 
secondly  we had begun to report net income and had significantly increased oil and gas reserve values 
lastly  we completed a debt financing arrangement and an equity financing arrangement that allow us to continue with our operating plan 
accordingly  we believed that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax asset created by the net operating loss carryover 
future reporting periods are expected to report income tax expense at an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 
for the year ended august   compared to the year ended august for the year ended august   we reported a net loss of  or per share  compared to a net loss of  or per share for the period ended august  as explained below  the net loss for each year is significantly affected by non cash charges related to the convertible promissory notes and the derivative conversion liability 
the following discussion also expands upon items of inflow and outflow that affect operating income 
in most cases  the nature of the change from to involves the significant growth in number of producing properties and activities to acquire additional undeveloped acreage and proved properties 
oil and gas production and revenues for the year ended august   we recorded total oil and gas revenues of  compared to  for the year ended august   as summarized in the following table year ended august  production oil bbls gas mcf total production in boe revenues oil gas total average sales price oil bbls gas mcf bbl refers to one stock tank barrel  or us gallons liquid volume in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons 
mcf refers to one thousand cubic feet of natural gas 
boe refers to barrel of oil equivalent  which combines bbls of oil and mcf of gas by converting each six mcf of gas to one bbl of oil 
net oil and gas production for the year ended august   was  boe  or boe per day  as compared with  boe  or boe per day  for the year ended august  the significant increase in production from the prior year resulted from realizing a full year of production from wells at the beginning of the year  and the addition of wells  including new wells drilled and those acquired in the pem acquisition 
production for the fourth fiscal quarter of averaged boe per day 
lease operating expenses as summarized in the following table  our lease expenses include the direct operating costs of producing oil and natural gas  taxes on production and properties  and well work over costs year ended august  production costs work over other lifting cost severance and ad valorem taxes total loe per boe production costs work over other lifting cost severance and ad valorem taxes total loe per boe lease operating and work over costs tend to increase or decrease primarily in relation to the number of wells in production  and  to a lesser extent  on fluctuation in oil field service costs and changes in the production mix of crude oil and natural gas 
taxes tend to increase or decrease primarily based on the value of oil and gas sold  and  as a percent of revenues  averaged in and in depletion  depreciation and amortization dda dda expense is summarized in the following table year ended august  depletion oil and gas assets depreciation and amortization other assets accretion of asset retirement obligations total dda depletion expense per boe the determination of depletion  depreciation and amortization expense is highly dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves and actual production volumes 
as of august   we had  boe of estimated net proved reserves compared to  boe of estimated net proved reserves as of august  depletion expense per boe increased approximately as a result of cost increases across all of our operating sectors  including costs incurred for lease acquisition  drillings  and well completion 
impairment of oil and gas properties we use the full cost accounting method  which requires recognition of impairment when the total capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling amount  as defined in the full cost accounting literature 
during the years ended august  and  no impairment was recorded because our capitalized costs subject to the ceiling test were less than the estimated future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unevaluated properties 
the ceiling test is performed each quarter and there is the possibility for impairments to be recognized in future periods 
once impairment is recognized  it cannot be reversed 
general and administrative the following table summarizes the components of general and administration expenses year ended august  cash based compensation share based compensation professional fees insurance other general and administrative capitalized general and administrative total g a cash based compensation includes payments to employees 
the increase of  from to reflects the expansion of our business  including the addition of employees during the year 
stock based compensation includes compensation paid to employees  directors  and service providers in the form of stock options or shares of common stock 
the amount of expense recorded for stock options is calculated by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the amount of expense recorded for shares of common stock is calculated based upon the closing market value of the shares 
the increase in professional fees includes certain accounting fees and investment banking fees related to the acquisition of assets from pem 
in addition  our progression from smaller reporting company to accelerated filer required additional professional services related to our compliance with the rules and regulations of sarbanes oxley 
pursuant to the requirements under the full cost accounting method for oil and gas properties  we identify all general and administrative costs that relate directly to the acquisition of undeveloped mineral leases and the development of properties 
those costs are reclassified from general and administrative expenses and capitalized into the full cost pool 
the increase in capitalized costs from to reflects our increasing activities to acquire leases and develop the properties 
operating income loss for the year ended august   we generated operating income of  as compared with an operating loss of  for the year ended august  this increase of  resulted primarily from the increasing contribution of wells brought into production during the two fiscal years  which includes wells drilled under the and drilling programs  the acquisition of producing properties from pem and other parties  and increased production from older wells that were recompleted using newer hydraulic fracturing techniques 
increased revenues more than offset increased costs incurred by us to accomplish these objectives 
other income expense during the year ended august   we recognized  in other expense compared to  during the comparable period in during  interest expense was also recorded on the related party note and the bank line of credit in the amounts of  and  respectively 
of these expenses  we capitalized interest and amortization of  compared to  capitalized in the amounts included in other income expense are primarily related to components of the convertible promissory notes 
the convertible promissory notes contained a conversion feature  which was considered an embedded derivative and recorded as a liability at its initial estimated fair value 
this derivative conversion liability was then marked to market over time  with the resulting change in fair value recorded as a non cash item in the statement of operations 
prior to august   all of the notes had been converted  thereby eliminating the derivative conversion liability 
we recognized a non cash expense of  and  during the years ending august  and  respectively  related to the change in fair value of the derivative conversion liability 
interest expense  net  contained several components related to the convertible promissory notes 
in addition to the coupon rate  we recorded amortization of debt issue costs of  and accretion of debt discount of  during the year ended august  during the year ended august   amortization of debt issue costs was  and accretion of debt discount was  in connection with the conversion of the remaining convertible promissory notes outstanding during  the company accelerated its recognition of all remaining amounts for unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount and the acceleration is included in the amounts presented above 
income taxes income taxes had no impact on our results of operations for the fiscal years ended august  and  as we had reported a net loss every year since inception and for tax purposes had a net operating loss carry forward nol of approximately million 
the nol is available to offset future taxable income 
as of august  and  management concluded that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize the benefits of our tax assets in the foreseeable future  therefore a full valuation allowance had been provided against deferred tax assets as of august  and liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity since inception has been net cash provided by sales and other issuances of equity and debt securities 
our secondary sources of capital have been cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of properties  and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
our primary use of capital has been for the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available to us 
while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to us from cash flows from operations and under our revolving credit facility unforeseen events may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we have on file with the sec an effective universal shelf registration statement that we may use for future securities offerings 
terms of future financings may be unfavorable  and we cannot assure investors that funding will be available on acceptable terms 
in november  we modified our borrowing arrangement with community banks of colorado  successor in interest to bank of choice  to increase the maximum allowable borrowings and to reduce the interest rate 
in april  the agreement was amended to further increase the borrowing base 
the revolving line of credit provides us a borrowing capacity to million 
outstanding borrowings accrue interest at the greater of annually or the bank s prime rate  which was also at august  the maturity date for the arrangement is november  the arrangement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict the payment of dividends and require compliance with certain financial ratios  for which we were fully in compliance as of august  the borrowing arrangement is collateralized by certain of our assets  including producing properties 
maximum borrowings are subject to reduction based upon a borrowing base calculation 
as of august   the borrowing base calculation was not restrictive 
we utilized a portion of the financing available through this arrangement to retire amounts outstanding under our related party note payable 
at august   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and a  balance available under our revolving credit facility 
on october   we entered into an amendment to this revolving line of credit agreement 
the amended terms include an increase from million to million in the maximum amount of borrowings available  subject to certain collateral requirements 
other terms of the agreement  including interest on borrowed amounts and the commitment expiration date of november   were not materially changed 
proceeds from any future borrowings are expected to be used primarily to fund lease acquisitions and drilling and completion costs 
on december   we completed the sale of million shares of common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
we netted  in proceeds  after deductions for the underwriting discounts  commissions and expenses of the offering 
we do not currently engage in any commodity hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
we believe that the proceeds from our equity offering  plus cash flow from operations  plus additional borrowings available under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs during the remainder of this fiscal year 
the amount  timing and allocation of capital expenditures is generally within our control  as participations are a limited portion of our operations 
fluctuations in prices for oil and natural gas could cause us to defer or accelerate our spending 
our sources and uses of funds for the fiscal years ended august   and  are shown below year ended august  cash provided by used in operations acquisition of oil and gas propertiesand equipment proceeds from sales of oil and gas properties proceeds from sale of convertible notes  net of debt issuance costs repayment of related party debt repayment proceeds from bank loan proceeds from sale of common stock  net of offering costs net increase in cash net cash provided by operating activities was  and  for the years ended august  and  respectively 
the significant improvement reflects the operating contribution from wells that were producing for the entire year  plus the contribution from wells that began production during in addition to our analysis using amounts included in the cash flow statement  we evaluate operations using a non gaap measure called adjusted cash flow from operations  which adjusts for cash flow items that merely reflect the timing of certain cash receipts and expenditures 
adjusted cash flow from operations was  for the year ended august   compared  for the year ended august  the improvement of  under that measure is closely correlated to  and primarily explained by  increased revenues of  less increased operating costs of  the timing of cash receipts and payments explains  of the variance in the measure 
the cash flow statement reports actual cash expenditures for capital expenditures  which differs from total capital expenditures on a full accrual basis 
specifically  cash paid for acquisition of property and equipment as reflected in the statement of cash flows excludes non cash capital expenditures and includes an adjustment plus or minus to reflect the timing of when the capital expenditure obligations are incurred and when the actual cash payment is made 
on a full accrual basis  capital expenditures totaled   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively  compared to cash payments of   and  respectively 
a reconciliation of the differences is summarized in the following table year ended august  cash payments accrued costs  beginning of period accrued costs  end of period properties acquired in exchange for common stock properties acquired in exchange for note payable sales of properties asset retirement obligation capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended august   we engaged in drilling or completion activities on wells 
most of our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended august   represent drilling and completion cost on wells on which production commenced during the year 
in addition  we incurred costs of million on the acquisition of mineral leases  million of which were acquired in exchange for our common stock 
our primary need for cash for the fiscal year ending august   will be to fund our drilling and acquisition programs 
under the updated plans for our capital budget  we estimate capital expenditures of approximately million for additional drilling  participating in drilling  and acquiring properties 
we increased the budget from million in connection with the acquisition of assets from orr energy llc orr for cash payment of million 
as an operator  we plan to spend approximately million to drill vertical wells and approximately million to drill horizontal wells 
an additional million has been estimated as our portion of the cost of vertical and horizontal wells in which we will participate as a non operator 
we also plan recompletion costs approximating million on wells that indicate good potential for additional hydraulic stimulation 
we allocated million for the acquisition of undeveloped acreage 
our capital expenditure plans described herein represent cash payments  and exclude assets acquired in exchange for common stock 
the proposed acquisition of assets from orr anticipates partial payment in shares of common stock with a value of million 
our capital expenditure estimate is subject to adjustment for drilling success  acquisition opportunities  operating cash flow  and available capital resources 
on october   we entered into an agreement to acquire developed and undeveloped oil and gas properties in the d j basin 
closing of the transaction is expected to occur before december  the purchase price for these oil and gas properties is expected to be million  consisting of cash and restricted shares of synergy s common stock 
contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of august less than one year one to three years three to five years total rig contract revolving credit facility operating leases employment agreements total as of august   we had agreed with ensign united states drilling  inc to use a drilling rig through december  total payments due to ensign will depend upon a number of variables  including the number of wells drilled  the target formations  and other technical details 
we estimate that the total commitment for the four month period will approximate million for the drilling of approximately wells 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonable likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
non gaap financial measures we use adjusted cash flow from operations and adjusted ebitda  non gaap financial measures  for internal managerial purposes  when evaluating period to period comparisons 
these measures are not measures of financial performance under us gaap and should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  cash flows from operations  investing  or financing activities  nor as a liquidity measure or indicator of cash flows reported in accordance with us gaap 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to measures with similar titles reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
we strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure 
see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures below for a detailed description of these measures as well as a reconciliation of each to the nearest us gaap measure 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted cash flow from operations 
we define adjusted cash flow from operations as the cash flow earned or incurred from operating activities without regard to the collection or payment of associated receivables and payables 
we believe it is important to consider adjusted cash flow from operations as well as cash flow from operations  as we believe it often provides more transparency into what drives the changes in our operating trends  such as production  prices  operating costs  and related operational factors  without regard to whether the earned or incurred item was collected or paid during the period 
we also use this measure because the collection of our receivables or payment of our obligations has not been a significant issue for our business  but merely a timing issue from one period to the next 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense  net of interest income  income taxes  stock based compensation  and depreciation  depletion and amortization for the period plus minus the change in fair value of our derivative conversion liability 
we believe adjusted ebitda is relevant because it is a measure of cash available to fund our capital expenditures and service our debt and is a metric used by some industry analysts to provide a comparison of our results with our peers 
the following table presents a reconciliation of each of our non gaap financial measures to its nearest gaap measure 
year ended august  adjusted cash flow from operations net cash provided by operating activities changes in assets and liabilities adjusted cash flow from operations adjusted ebitda net income loss interest expense and related items  net change in fair value of derivative conversion liability provision for income tax depletion depreciation and amortization stock based compensation adjusted ebitda trend and outlook during the past several months  the gas gathering system in the wattenberg field has been unable to gather all the gas that could be produced 
production from new wells  particularly new horizontal wells  has strained the capacity of the system that gathers natural gas and associated liquids 
the additional supply of gas creates elevated line pressure in the pipeline 
when we are unable to deliver all of our gas into the pipeline  the production of oil and liquids are simultaneously restricted 
several corrective measures are underway 
dcp midstream partners  our third party provider of gathering  processing and transportation facilities  is rapidly expanding their capacity 
dcp is creating a super system in weld county of a broad network of gathering and processing facilities that afford significant optionality and flexibility  which enables dcp to optimize its processing capacity 
a significant improvement in the system will occur in  when a new processing plant in lasalle  colorado comes on line 
in addition to substantially increasing capacity  dcp will improve reliability by extending the high pressure gathering system grid connected to its processing plants 
other gas gathering providers have announced similar initiatives to improve the infrastructure 
the recently announced front range pipeline will also help producers in the d j basin maximize the value of their ngl production by providing connectivity to the premium mont belvieu  tx market 
dcp  enterprise products partners and anadarko petroleum are building an interstate ngl pipeline that will originate in weld county  colorado 
initial capacity on front range is expected to be  bpd  which can be expanded to approximately  bpd 
connectivity to mont belvieu includes transportation via the recently announced texas express pipeline  in which dcp has a vested interest as a owner 
the texas express pipeline is expected to be completed by the second quarter of  and front range pipeline is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter we expect these third party capital projects to accommodate our and other producer s throughput  including anticipated aggressive growth in the basin 
for our part  we have begun installing improved equipment  including compressors  to strategic pad locations 
we are also accelerating our previously planned maintenance and modification expenditures on certain wells to improve volume output 
other factors that will most significantly affect our results of operations include i activities on properties that we operate  ii the marketability of our production  iii our ability to satisfy our substantial capital requirements  iv completion of acquisitions of additional properties and reserves  v competition from larger companies  and vi prices for oil and gas 
our revenues will also be significantly impacted by our ability to maintain or increase oil or gas production through exploration and development activities 
it is expected that our principal source of cash flow will be from the production and sale of oil and gas reserves  which are depleting assets 
cash flow from the sale of oil and gas production depends upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for the production 
an increase in prices will permit us to finance our operations to a greater extent with internally generated funds  may allow us to obtain equity financing more easily or on better terms  and lessens the difficulty of obtaining debt financing 
however  price increases heighten the competition for oil and gas prospects  increase the costs of exploration and development  and  because of potential price declines  increase the risks associated with the purchase of producing properties during times that prices are at higher levels 
a decline in oil and gas prices i will reduce our cash flow which in turn will reduce the funds available for exploring for and replacing oil and gas reserves  ii will potentially reduce our current loc borrowing base capacity and increase the difficulty of obtaining equity and debt financing and worsen the terms on which such financing may be obtained  iii will reduce the number of oil and gas prospects which have reasonable economic terms  iv may cause us to permit leases to expire based upon the value of potential oil and gas reserves in relation to the costs of exploration  and v may result in marginally productive oil and gas wells being abandoned as non commercial 
however  price declines reduce the competition for oil and gas properties and correspondingly reduce the prices paid for leases and prospects 
other than the foregoing  we do not know of any trends  events or uncertainties that will have had or are reasonably expected to have a material impact on our sales  revenues or expenses 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments below 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for a detailed discussion of the nature of our accounting practices and additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas sales we derive revenue primarily from the sale of produced crude oil and natural gas 
revenues from production on properties in which we share an economic interest with other owners are recognized on the basis of our interest 
revenues are reported on a gross basis for the amounts received before taking into account production taxes and transportation costs  which are reported as separate expenses 
revenue is recorded and receivables are accrued using the sales method  which occurs in the month production is delivered to the purchaser  at which time ownership of the oil is transferred to the purchaser 
payment is generally received between thirty and ninety days after the date of production 
provided that reasonable estimates can be made  revenue and receivables are accrued to recognize delivery of product to the purchaser 
differences between estimates and actual volumes and prices  if any  are adjusted upon final settlement 
oil and gas reserves oil and gas reserves represent theoretical  estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data estimate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and gas reserves and their values  including many factors beyond our control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are different from the future quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered and the corresponding lifting costs associated with the recovery of these reserves 
the determination of depletion and amortization expenses  as well as the ceiling test calculation related to the recorded value of our oil and natural gas properties  is highly dependent on estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas reserves including the costs of unsuccessful efforts are capitalized into a single full cost pool 
these costs include land acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expense  carrying charges on non producing properties  costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities 
under the full cost method  no gain or loss is recognized upon the sale or abandonment of oil and gas properties unless non recognition of such gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and gas reserves 
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties are depleted using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved reserves 
for depletion purposes  the volume of petroleum reserves and production is converted into a common unit of measure at the energy equivalent conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil 
investments in unevaluated properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
asset retirement obligations aro we are subject to legal and contractual obligations to reclaim  remediate  or otherwise restore properties at the time the asset is permanently removed from service 
calculation of an aro requires estimates about several future events  including the life of the asset  the costs to remove the asset from service  and inflation factors 
the aro is initially estimated based upon discounted cash flows over the life of the asset and is accreted to full value over time using our credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
estimates are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect changes 
the present value of a liability for the aro is initially recorded when it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
this is typically when a well is completed or an asset is placed in service 
when the aro is initially recorded  we capitalize the cost asset retirement cost or arc by increasing the carrying value of the related asset 
arcs related to wells are capitalized to the full cost pool and subject to depletion 
over time  the liability increases for the change in its present value accretion of aro  while the capitalized cost decreases over the useful life of the asset  recognized as depletion 
stock based compensation we recognize all equity based compensation as stock based compensation expense  included in general and administrative expenses  based on the fair value of the compensation measured at the grant date 
the expense is recognized over the vesting period of the grant 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recorded for timing differences between items of income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for income tax purposes using the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes and tax benefits are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax loss and credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we provide for deferred taxes for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards when realization is more likely than not 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the net deferred tax asset will not be realized  the balance of net deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider many factors in our evaluation of deferred tax assets  including the following sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a portion or all of a tax benefit for deductible timing differences and carry forwards future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years  if permitted  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
recent accounting pronouncements we evaluate the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations to determine the impact of new pronouncements on us gaap and their impact on us 
in december  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities 
this asu requires us to disclose both net and gross information about assets and liabilities that have been offset  if any  and the related arrangements 
the disclosures under this new guidance are required to be provided retrospectively for all comparative periods presented 
we are required to implement this guidance effective for the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial statements 
various other accounting standards updates recently issued  most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable to specific industries  and are not expected to a have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s commodity risk our primary market risk exposure results from the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
we do not currently engage in any commodity hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
realized commodity pricing for our production is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable in recent years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the foreseeable future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable commodity index price 
interest rate risk at august   we had debt outstanding under our bank credit facility totaling  interest on our bank credit facility accrues at the greater of or the prime rate  which was also at august  while we are currently incurring interest at the floor of  we are exposed to interest rate risk on the bank credit facility if the prime rate exceeds the floor 
the agreement provides an interest rate index of libor plus at our option 
if interest rates increase  our interest expense would increase and our available cash flow would decrease 
hypothetically  a increase in the prime rate for the year ended august  would have resulted in an estimated  increase in interest expense for the year ended august
