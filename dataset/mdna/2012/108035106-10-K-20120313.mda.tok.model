on august   standard poor s downgraded the united states long term debt rating from its aaa rating to aa 
on august   standard poor s downgraded the credit ratings of certain long term debt instruments issued by fannie mae and freddie mac and other us government agencies linked to long term us debt 
instruments of this nature are key assets on the balance sheets page 
table of contents of financial institutions  including the bank 
these downgrades could adversely affect the market value of such instruments  and could adversely impact the company s ability to obtain funding that is collateralized by affected instruments  as well as affecting the pricing of that funding when it is available 
we cannot predict if  when or how these changes to the credit ratings will affect economic conditions 
opportunities and challenges since the second half of and continuing through  the financial markets experienced significant volatility resulting from the continued fallout of sub prime lending and the global liquidity crises 
a multitude of government initiatives along with eight rate cuts by the federal reserve totaling basis points have been designed to improve liquidity for the distressed financial markets 
the ultimate objective of these efforts has been to help the beleaguered consumer  and reduce the potential surge of residential mortgage loan foreclosures and stabilize the banking system 
as a result the yield on loans and investment securities has declined 
the squeeze between declining asset yields and more slowly declining liability pricing has impacted margins 
effective as of february   the federal reserve increased the discount rate basis points to 
the federal reserve stated that this rate change was intended to normalize their lending facility and to step away from emergency lending to banks 
from april through january the federal reserve decided to maintain the federal funds target rate between and basis points due to a continued national depressed housing market and tight credit markets 
growth and service strategies have the potential to offset the tighter net interest margin with volume as the customer base grows through expanding the bank s footprint  while maintaining and developing existing relationships 
since  the bank has opened eight new branches 
in  the bank opened three new branches located in the village of southampton  cutchogue  and wading river 
in april  the bank opened a new branch in shirley  new york  and in december  the bank opened a new full service branch facility in the village of east hampton 
during  the bank opened three new branches  center moriches in may  patchogue in september and deer park in october 
the recent branch openings move the bank geographically westward and demonstrate its commitment to traditional growth through branch expansion 
in may  the bank acquired hamptons state bank which increased the bank s presence in an existing market with a branch located in the village of southampton 
in july  the bank converted the former hsb customers to the bank s core operating system 
management spent considerable time ensuring the transition progressed smoothly for hsb s former customers and shareholders 
management has demonstrated its ability to successfully integrate the former hsb customers and achieve expected cost savings while continuing to execute its business strategy 
in september  the bank obtained occ approval for its st branch in ronkonkoma  new york 
this location s proximity to macarthur airport complements the patchogue branch and extends the bank s reach into the bohemia market 
management will continue to seek opportunities to expand its reach into other contiguous markets by network expansion  or through the addition of professionals with established customer relationships 
was another year of milestone achievements and significant change for the company 
the acquisition  organic growth and considerably higher capital demonstrate management s ability to identify  leverage and efficiently execute on opportunities 
management foresees future opportunities to continue this trajectory and positive momentum 
the bank s customers and certain markets in which the bank operates have been less affected than others by recent economic turmoil 
however  the bank s customers and the bank itself are not insulated from the general economic environment and its related impacts 
recognizing this is critical to the company s continued ability to execute its strategy 
management must continue to foster relationships with businesses and customers that share the same principles and philosophies for prudent and reasonable fiscal and operational management 
the current banking environment remains challenging in many respects 
the absolute level of interest rates and the potential for them to remain at or near historic lows  for an extended period  creates issues for margin management and heightened risks to the eventuality of higher rates 
the omnipresent regulatory environment with its pending new regulations  rules and compliance burdens certainly contributes to uncertainty 
finally  the credit environment appears to be improving 
however  there is the potential at any moment for a change depending on the impact of world and national events  or more localized issues with municipal budgets and the related fallout 
any one of these factors could affect economic activity and the bank s customers businesses  creating a domino effect on credit quality 
the prospects of the financial services sector and the company continue to be impacted by the final outcome of the implementation of the dodd frank act 
this act includes the repeal of regulation q  which prohibited the payment of interest on checking accounts  and the durbin amendment  which establishes fixed interchange fees and could impact future revenues and expenses 
the company is awaiting the expected new rules  regulations and related compliance and process changes and will expand its compliance resources appropriately 
the bank continues to collaborate with its primary regulator to ensure compliance with current requirements and interpretations 
it is the belief of management that its strong risk management culture is a primary reason for its long term success and management views the current challenges as opportunities to expand its business and deliver the promise of successful community banking to its customers and shareholders 
corporate objectives for include leveraging our expanding branch network to build customer relationships and grow loans and deposits  focusing on opportunities and processes that continue to enhance the customer experience at the bank  improving operational efficiencies and prudent management of non interest expense  and maximizing non interest income through bridge page

critical accounting policies note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
our policy with respect to the methodologies used to determine the allowance for loan losses is our most critical accounting policy 
this policy is important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and it involves a higher degree of complexity and requires management to make difficult and subjective judgments  which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
the use of different judgments  assumptions and estimates could result in material differences in our results of operations or financial condition 
the following is a description of our critical accounting policy and an explanation of the methods and assumptions underlying its application 
allowance for loan losses management considers the accounting policy on the allowance for loan losses to be the most critical and requires complex management judgment as discussed below 
the judgments made regarding the allowance for loan losses can have a material effect on the results of operations of the company 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
if the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the company s earnings could decrease 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions  and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process including the procedures for impairment testing under fasb accounting standard codification asc no 
 receivables 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to our policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
these assumptions and judgments are also used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
loan pool valuation allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risks associated with our lending activities  but which  unlike individual allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem assets 
pool evaluations are broken down into loans with homogenous characteristics by loan type and include commercial real estate mortgages  owner and non owner occupied  multi family mortgages  residential real estate mortgages  first lien and home equity  commercial loans  secured and unsecured  installment consumer loans  and real estate construction and land loans 
the determination of the adequacy of the valuation allowance is a process that takes into consideration a variety of factors 
the bank has developed a range of valuation allowances necessary to adequately provide for probable incurred losses inherent in each pool of loans 
we consider our own charge off history along with the growth in the portfolio as well as the bank s credit administration and asset management philosophies and procedures  and concentrations in the portfolio when determining the allowances for each pool 
in addition  we evaluate and consider the credit s risk rating which includes management s evaluation of cash flow  collateral  guarantor support  financial disclosures  industry trends and strength of borrowers management  the impact that economic and market conditions may have on the portfolio as page 
table of contents well as known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
finally  we evaluate and consider the allowance ratios and coverage percentages of both peer group and regulatory agency data 
these evaluations are inherently subjective because  even though they are based on objective data  it is management s interpretation of that data that determines the amount of the appropriate allowance 
if the evaluations prove to be incorrect  the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio  resulting in additions to the allowance for loan losses 
the credit risk committee is comprised of members of both management and the board of directors 
the adequacy of the allowance is analyzed quarterly  with any adjustment to a level deemed appropriate by the credit risk committee  based on its risk assessment of the entire portfolio 
based on the credit risk committee s review of the classified loans and the overall allowance levels as they relate to the entire loan portfolio at december   management believes the allowance for loan losses has been established at levels sufficient to cover the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic  market or other conditions 
changes in estimates could result in a material change in the allowance 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of the examination process  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
for additional information regarding our allowance for loan losses  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquired loans loans that were acquired from the acquisition of hamptons state bank on may  are recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for loan losses 
after acquisition  losses are recognized by an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
determining fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of expected principal and interest cash flows to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at a market interest rate 
some of the loans at time of acquisition showed evidence of credit deterioration since origination 
for purchased credit impaired loans  the excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
the difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable discount 
the nonaccretable discount represents estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
subsequent increases to the expected cash flows result in the reversal of a corresponding amount of the nonaccretable discount which is then reclassified as accretable discount and recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the interest method 
subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows require us to evaluate the need for an addition to the allowance for loan losses 
purchased credit impaired loans that met the criteria for nonaccrual of interest prior to the acquisition may be considered performing upon acquisition  regardless of whether the customer is contractually delinquent  if management can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of the expected cash flows on such loans and if management expects to fully collect the new carrying value of the loans 
as such  management may no longer consider the loans to be nonaccrual or nonperforming and may accrue interest on these loans  including the impact of any accretable discount

net interest income net interest income  the primary contributor to earnings  represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expenses on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s average consolidated balance sheets and its consolidated statements of income for the years indicated and reflect the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the years indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the years shown 
average balances are derived from daily average balances and include nonaccrual loans 
the yields and costs include fees  which are considered adjustments to yields 
interest on nonaccrual loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated statements of income

table of contents rate volume analysis net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes 
the following table illustrates the extent to which changes in interest rates and in the volume of average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected the bank s interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rates changes in rates multiplied by prior volume  and iii the net changes 
for purposes of this table  changes that are not due solely to volume or rate changes have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate

table of contents provision for loan losses the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential real estate properties located in the bank s principal lending area of suffolk county which is located on the eastern portion of long island 
the interest rates charged by the bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  the rates offered by its competitors  the bank s relationship with the customer  and the related credit risks of the transaction 
these factors are affected by general and economic conditions including  but not limited to  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters 
loans of approximately million or of total loans at december  were categorized as classified loans compared to million or at december  and million or at december  classified loans include loans with credit quality indicators with the internally assigned grades of special mention  substandard and doubtful 
these loans are categorized as classified loans as management has information that indicates the borrower may not be able to comply with the present repayment terms 
these loans are subject to increased management attention and their classification is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis 
the increase in the and levels of classified loans reflects the current economic environment as well as management s decision during to enhance the asset and credit quality review process of the loan portfolio 
this process includes the early identification of potential problem loans  a more stringent assessment of potential credit weaknesses and expanding the scope and depth of individual credit reviews 
additionally  higher classified loans as of december  primarily related to a million increase in the special mention category as well as acquired classified loans from the hsb merger 
at december   approximately million of these loans were commercial real estate cre loans which were well secured with real estate as collateral 
of the million of cre loans  million were current and million were past due

at december   approximately million of classified loans were residential real estate loans with million current and million past due 
commercial  financial  and agricultural loans represented million of classified loans and million was current and million was past due 
approximately million of classified loans represented real estate construction and land loans and million was current and million was past due 
all real estate construction and land loans are well secured with collateral 
the remaining million in classified loans are consumer loans that are unsecured  have personal guarantees and demonstrate sufficient cash flow to pay the loans 
of the million of consumer loans   were past due with the remaining loans current 
due to the structure and nature of the credits  we do not expect to sustain a material loss on these relationships 
cre loans  including multi family loans  represented million or of the total loan portfolio at december  compared to million or at december  and million or at december  the bank s underwriting standards for cre loans requires an evaluation of the cash flow of the property  the overall cash flow of the borrower and related guarantors as well as the value of the real estate securing the loan

as of december  and december   the company had impaired loans as defined by fasb asc no 
 receivables of million and million  respectively 
for a loan to be considered impaired  management determines after review whether it is probable that the bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
management applies its normal loan review procedures in making these judgments 
impaired loans include individually classified nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured tdr loans 
for impaired loans  the bank evaluates the impairment of the loan in accordance with fasb asc impairment is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
for loans that are collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the fair value of the loan 
the fair value of the collateral is determined based upon recent appraised values

table of contents loans during  the company continued to experience growth trends in commercial and residential real estate lending 
the concentration of loans in our primary market areas may increase risk 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by commercial and residential real estate properties located in the bank s principal lending area in suffolk county which is located on eastern long island 
the local economic conditions on eastern long island have a significant impact on the volume of loan originations and the quality of our loans  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of collateral securing these loans 
a considerable decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond the company s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of the company s operations 
additionally  while the company has a significant amount of commercial real estate loans  the majority of which are owner occupied  decreases in tenant occupancy may also have a negative effect on the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on the company s earnings 
the interest rates charged by the bank on loans are affected primarily by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  the rates offered by its competitors  the bank s relationship with the customer  and the related credit risks of the transaction 
these factors are affected by general and economic conditions including  but not limited to  monetary policies of the federal government  including the federal reserve board  legislative policies and governmental budgetary matters 
the bank targets its business lending and marketing initiatives towards promotion of loans that primarily meet the needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses  the results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
with respect to the underwriting of loans  there are certain risks  including the risk of non payment that is associated with each type of loan that the bank markets 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio at december  is secured by real estate 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio is comprised of commercial real estate loans 
multifamily loans represent of the bank s loan portfolio 
residential real estate mortgage loans represent of the bank s loan portfolio and include home equity lines of credit of approximately of the bank s loan portfolio and residential mortgages of approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
real estate construction and land loans comprise approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
risks associated with a concentration in real estate loans include potential losses from fluctuating values of land and improved properties 
home equity loans represent loans originated in the bank s geographic markets with original loan to value ratios generally of or less 
the bank s residential mortgage portfolio includes approximately million in interest only mortgages 
the underwriting standards for interest only mortgages are consistent with the remainder of the loan portfolio and do not include any features that result in negative amortization 
the largest loan concentrations by industry are loans granted to lessors of commercial property both owner occupied and non owner occupied 
the bank uses conservative underwriting criteria to better insulate itself from a downturn in real estate values and economic conditions on eastern long island that could have a significant impact on the value of collateral securing the loans as well as the ability of customers to repay loans 
the remainder of the loan portfolio is comprised of commercial and consumer loans  which represent approximately of the bank s loan portfolio 
the primary risks associated with commercial loans are the cash flow of the business  the experience and quality of the borrowers management  the business climate  and the impact of economic factors 
the primary risks associated with consumer loans relate to the borrower  such as the risk of a borrower s unemployment as a result of deteriorating economic conditions or the amount and nature of a borrower s other existing indebtedness  and the value of the collateral securing the loan if the bank must take possession of the collateral 
consumer loans also have risks associated with concentrations of specific types of consumer loans within the portfolio 
the bank s policy for charging off loans is a multi step process 
a loan is considered a potential charge off when it is in default of either principal or interest for a period of  or days  depending upon the loan type  as of the end of the prior month 
in addition to date criteria  other triggering events may include  but are not limited to  notice of bankruptcy by the borrower or guarantor  death of the borrower  and deficiency balance from the sale of collateral 
these loans identified are presented for evaluation at the regular meeting of the credit risk committee 
a loan is charged off when a loss is reasonably assured 
the recovery of charged off balances is actively pursued until the potential for recovery has been exhausted  or until the expense of collection does not justify the recovery efforts

liquidity management addresses the ability of the company to meet financial obligations that arise in the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet customer borrowing commitments  deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity  to repay other borrowings as they mature  to fund current and planned expenditures and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the company s principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million as of december   and dividends from the bank 
cash available for distribution of dividends to shareholders of the company is primarily derived from dividends paid by the bank to the company 
during  the bank did not pay a cash dividend to the company 
prior regulatory approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of the bank s net income of that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years 
at december   the bank had million of retained net income available for dividends to the company 
in the event that the company subsequently expands its current operations  in addition to dividends from the bank  it will need to rely on its own earnings  additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the levels of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include loan and investment securities principal repayments and maturities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the federal home loan bank and federal reserve bank  growth in core deposits and sources of wholesale funding such as brokered certificates of deposit 
while scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities and short term investments are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows  loans  and asset and liability management objectives 
historically  the bank has relied on its deposit base  drawn through its full service branches that serve its market area and local municipal deposits  as its principal source of funding 
the bank seeks to retain existing deposits and loans and maintain customer relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to its customers  while managing the overall cost of funds needed to finance its strategies

management continually monitors the liquidity position and believes that sufficient liquidity exists to meet all of our operating requirements 
based on the objectives determined by the asset and liability committee  the bank s liquidity levels may be affected by the use of short term and wholesale borrowings  and the amount of public funds in the deposit mix 
the asset and liability committee is comprised of members of senior management and the board 
excess short term liquidity is invested in overnight federal funds sold or in an interest earning account at the federal reserve

the company did not repurchase any shares in  or impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or in the same magnitude  as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve bank 
impact of prospective accounting standards for discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note p of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management considers interest rate risk to be the most significant market risk for the company 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net income of the company as a result of changes in interest rates 
the company s primary earnings source is net interest income  which is affected by changes in the level of interest rates  the relationship between rates  the impact of interest rate fluctuations on asset prepayments  the level and composition of deposits and liabilities  and the credit quality of earning assets 
the company s objectives in its asset and liability management are to maintain a strong  stable net interest margin  to utilize its capital effectively without taking undue risks  to maintain adequate liquidity  and to reduce vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates 
the company s asset and liability committee evaluates periodically  but at least four times a year  the impact of changes in market interest rates on assets and liabilities  net interest margin  capital and liquidity 
risk assessments are governed by policies and limits established by senior management  which are reviewed and approved by the full board of directors at least annually 
the economic environment continually presents uncertainties as to future interest rate trends 
the asset and liability committee regularly utilizes a model that projects net interest income based on increasing or decreasing interest rates  in order to be better able to respond to changes in interest rates 
at december   million or of the company s securities had fixed interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the value of the company s interest earning assets and in particular its securities portfolio 
generally  the value of securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets  which could adversely affect the company s stockholders equity and its results of operations if sold 
the company is also page 
table of contents subject to reinvestment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates also could affect the type fixed rate or adjustable rate and amount of loans originated by the company and the average life of loans and securities  which can impact the yields earned on the company s loans and securities 
in periods of decreasing interest rates  the average life of loans and securities held by the company may be shortened to the extent increased prepayment activity occurs during such periods which  in turn  may result in the investment of funds from such prepayments in lower yielding assets 
under these circumstances the company is subject to reinvestment risk to the extent that it is unable to reinvest the cash received from such prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates on existing loans and securities 
additionally  increases in interest rates may result in decreasing loan prepayments with respect to fixed rate loans and therefore an increase in the average life of such loans  may result in a decrease in loan demand  and make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
the company utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
management routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the simulation model captures the seasonality of the company s deposit flows and the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and the interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to the asset and liability policy limits that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given a and basis point upward shift in interest rates and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed 
the following reflects the company s net interest income sensitivity analysis at december  change in interest potential change in net interest income rates in basis points change change dollars in thousands static the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a company forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate levels and yield curve shapes  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment and replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon perceived current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences may change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals  prepayment penalties and product preference changes and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to  or anticipating changes in interest rates and market conditions
