segments precious metal segment primarily fabricates precious metals and their alloys into brazing alloys 
brazing alloys are used to join similar and dissimilar metals as well as specialty metals and some ceramics with strong  hermetic joints 
precious metal segment offers these metal joining products in a wide variety of alloys including gold  silver  palladium  copper  nickel  aluminum and tin 
these brazing alloys are fabricated into a variety of engineered forms and are used in many industries including electrical  appliance  transportation  construction and general industrial  where dissimilar material and metal joining applications are required 
operating income from precious metal products is principally derived from the value added of processing and fabricating and not from the purchase and resale of precious metal
