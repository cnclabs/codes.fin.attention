overview we have been manufacturing mining equipment for over years 
we operate in two business segments underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment 
we are a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment for the extraction of coal and other minerals and ores 
our underground mining machinery segment is a major manufacturer of underground mining equipment for the extraction of coal and other bedded minerals 
our surface mining equipment segment is a major producer of surface mining equipment for the extraction of ores and minerals and provides extensive operational support for many types of equipment used in surface mining 
both segments offer comprehensive service locations near major mining regions worldwide 
in addition to selling original equipment  we provide parts  components  repairs  rebuilds  diagnostic analysis  training  and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines 
we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies  including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as alliance partners 
we emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business 
letourneau technologies  inc on june  we purchased letourneau technologies  inc for approximately billion 
we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock 
letourneau designs  builds and supports equipment for the mining industry and has been a leader in the earthmoving equipment industry since the s 
letourneau operated in three business segments  mining  steel products and drilling products 
the mining products business is the world s leading manufacturer of large wheel loaders for surface mining  providing the industry s largest model sizes and payload capacities 
on october  we completed the sale of letourneau technologies drilling systems  inc to cameron international corporation for million in cash  subject to a post closing working capital adjustment of which million was paid in the letourneau facilities in houston  texas and vicksburg  mississippi were sold to cameron international corporation in conjunction with this transaction 
we entered into a transition manufacturing and supply agreement to allow for the orderly transfer of drilling products production from longview and a steel supply agreement to allow the buyer time to develop other sources 
in conjunction with our entrance into the transition manufacturing and supply agreement  we recognized an upfront loss and related liability of million in our fiscal year for unreimbursable manufacturing costs 
the results of the drilling products business are included in discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated statement of income and the assets and liabilities of the drilling products business are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the results of the mining and steel businesses collectively the mining equipment business are included in our surface mining equipment segment 
from the date of acquisition until our fiscal year end  the mining equipment business of letourneau had net sales of million and operating income of million 
operating income was reduced by million for non recurring purchase accounting charges  of which million was attributable to acquired inventory 
in fiscal year  the mining equipment business of letourneau had net sales of million and operating income of million 
operating income was reduced by million for non recurring purchase accounting charges  of which million was attributable to acquired inventory 

table of contents international mining machinery on july   we entered into an spa with tjcc holdings limited  a corporation controlled by the jordan company  lp  to acquire approximately  of imm 
imm is a leading designer and manufacturer of underground coal mining equipment in china 
on july   august  and september  we purchased shares on the open market representing an aggregate of of the total outstanding shares of imm 
on december   the anti monopoly bureau of the ministry of commerce of the people s republic of china approved the purchase of imm shares covered by the spa and the acquisition closed on december  at such time  we acquired a controlling interest in imm which  when aggregated with earlier open market purchases  was of imm s outstanding common stock 
upon closing  we recognized a million gain on the re measurement of our pre existing equity interest in imm 
on january   in accordance with rule of the hong kong takeovers code  we commenced an unconditional cash tender offer to purchase the remaining outstanding imm shares and options to purchase imm shares that we did not own 
on february   we completed the tender offer 
as a result of the tender offer  our beneficial ownership of imm common stock increased to  for which we had paid aggregate consideration of approximately billion 
on july   we effected the compulsory acquisition of the remaining shares under applicable provisions of the cayman island companies law  under which imm is incorporated 
we paid consideration of approximately million to complete the compulsory acquisition  using the remaining cash which had been placed in escrow to purchase imm shares 
the combined effect of these transactions resulted in our beneficial ownership of of the common stock of imm 
from december   the date we acquired control of imm  until our fiscal year end  imm had net sales of million and operating income of million 
operating income was reduced by million for non recurring purchase accounting charges  of which million was attributable to acquired inventory 
operating results bookings for were approximately billion  a decrease of from the prior year 
underground original equipment bookings  which included million from imm  were down million  or  when compared to the prior year 
when excluding the impact of the imm acquisition  these bookings decreased in all regions except for africa due to the weakening coal market in the us and china  as well as significant orders from customers in australia and russia in the prior year that did not repeat in underground mining machinery aftermarket bookings were substantially flat compared to the prior year 
increases in aftermarket bookings in china  africa  and australia were partially offset by declining orders in the us and eurasia 
surface mining equipment original equipment orders  which included an incremental million increase from the acquisition of letourneau  were down million  or  when compared to the prior year 
these bookings were down in all regions except africa and australia due to weaker markets and the record bookings in the prior year 
surface mining equipment aftermarket bookings increased million  or 
these bookings increased in south america  australia  and eurasia due to increased demand for parts and services 
all other regions experienced declining aftermarket orders 
compared to last year  fiscal year bookings included a million unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation 
net sales for totaled approximately billion compared to billion in  an increase of 
in  imm had sales of million and letourneau s sales increased by million 
aftermarket sales increased million  or  when compared to the prior year due to increased parts sales and machine assemblies for both the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments 
original equipment sales increased million  or  when compared to the prior year due to last year s strong order rate flowing to this year s sales 
foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted sales by million 
operating income in was billion compared to prior year operating income of million  an increase of 
operating income in and was reduced by million and million in non recurring purchase accounting charges  respectively 
the increase in operating income was primarily the result of increased sales volume  offset by pension curtailment charges  restructuring costs and an increase in unfavorable manufacturing variances

provision for income taxes income tax expense for was million  as compared to million in the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and  for and  respectively 
the main drivers of the variance in tax rates when compared to the statutory rate of were the geographic mix of earnings with the corresponding net favorable differences in foreign statutory tax rates and the utilization of tax credits and tax holidays  offset by increased state income taxes and the establishment of valuation reserves 
a net discrete tax benefit of million was recorded in as compared to a net discrete tax benefit of million in a review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout and as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million and million  respectively  was recorded on a global basis 
reorganization items reorganization items include income  expenses  and losses that were realized or incurred by our predecessor as a result of its decision to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
we emerged from protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code on july  net reorganization items for   and consisted of the following in thousands professional fees directly related to the reorganization net reorganization expense critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the policies that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue on aftermarket products and services when the following criteria are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery and title transfer has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as for the manufacture of mining shovels  draglines  roof support systems and conveyor systems  using the percentage of completion method 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
approximately of our sales in were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service  with the remaining of sales recorded using percentage of completion accounting 
we have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these contracts are established based on the conditions the equipment will be operating in  the time horizon that the contracts will cover  and the expected operating cycle that will be required for the equipment 
based on this information  a model is created representing the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms 
accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these contracts  customers are generally billed monthly based on hours of operation or units of production achieved by the equipment  with the respective deferred revenues recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these contracts are reviewed quarterly by comparison of actual results to original estimates or most recent analysis  with revenue recognition adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
we have certain customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the accounting standards codification no 
 multiple element arrangements 
the agreements are assessed for multiple elements based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  including assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment  and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions  in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out method for all inventories 
we evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include drawings  patents  trademarks  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate 
as part of the impairment analysis  we use the discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were we to license the use of the indefinite lived asset 
no impairment was identified as part of 
table of contents our fourth quarter impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
no impairment was identified related to our finite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units  which we have identified as our operating segments  and tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to their book value 
we first determine  based on a qualitative assessment  whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that this is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then we determine the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the impairment test continues by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed were being determined initially 
if goodwill is impaired  we recognize an impairment loss based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
qualitative assessments regarding goodwill involve a high degree of judgment and can entail subjective considerations 
the discounted cash flow model involves many assumptions  including operating results forecasts and discount rates 
inherent in the operating results forecasts are certain assumptions regarding revenue growth rates  projected cost saving initiatives and projected long term growth rates in the determination of terminal values 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was identified 
accrued warranties we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
pension and postretirement benefits and costs pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  discussed below discount rates we generally estimate the discount rate for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using a process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we believe this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes weighted by the allocation of our plan assets 
our analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  however  the assumptions are primarily based on long term  prospective rates of return 

table of contents mortality rates mortality rates are based on the irs prescribed annuitant and non annuitant mortality for under the pension protection act of rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increase reflects our long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
future changes affecting the above assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively  as of and for the fiscal year ended october  increase decrease expected expected discount long term discount long term in thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return us pension plans net pension benefit expense projected decrease increase in benefit obligation non us pension plans net pension benefit expense projected decrease increase in benefit obligation other postretirement benefit plans net pension benefit expense projected decrease increase in benefit obligation income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 
as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year on an interim basis 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded 
table of contents separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
to the extent recognized  these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same year 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of in thousands october  october  accounts receivable inventories accounts payable advance payments trade working capital other current assets short term notes payable employee compensation and benefits accrued warranties other current liabilities working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents working capital imm added million to trade working capital at october  we currently use trade working capital and cash flow from operations as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we require trade working capital investment because our service model requires us to maintain certain inventory levels in order to maximize our customers machine availability 
this information also provides management with a focus on our receivable terms and collectability efforts and our ability to obtain advance payments on original equipment orders 
as part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
cash provided by continuing operations for was million as compared to million provided by operations for the decrease in cash provided by continuing operations was the result of increases in accounts receivables due to the timing of sales  increased inventory to support the strong sales activity  reduced accounts payable and by a reduction in advance payments resulting from a decline in new original equipment order activity 
cash provided by continuing operations was favorably impacted by increases in accrued liabilities due to a change in the timing of tax payments 
cash used by investing activities was million in compared to billion used by investing activities for investing activities in primarily related to the million investment in imm  which was funded in the prior year with a million cash deposit that was placed into an escrow account in anticipation of completing the imm transaction 
investing activities in primarily related to the billion acquisition of letourneau  the million investment in imm shares  and the million escrow deposit for the anticipated acquisition of imm  partially offset by the million sale of the letourneau drilling business 
cash used by financing activities for was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the difference was driven by the prior year entrance into a new million term loan for the acquisition of letourneau and the prior year issuance of million of senior notes in anticipation of completing the imm acquisition 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of the borrowing and subsequent repayment of a million note for the acquisition of imm  as well as the payment of million in dividends 

table of contents we expect capital spending to be approximately million 
capital projects will be focused on expanding service center capabilities globally and the increase of our manufacturing capabilities in the emerging markets

credit facilities and senior notes on october   we entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on november  the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  we also may request an increase of up to million of additional aggregate revolving commitments  subject to terms and conditions contained in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement simultaneously replaced the million revolving credit agreement  dated as of october  the prior credit agreement that was to have matured in november under the terms of the credit agreement we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating 
letters of credit issued under applicable provisions of the credit agreement represent an unfunded utilization of the credit agreement for purposes of calculating the periodic commitment fee due 
eurodollar rate loans will bear interest for a period from the applicable borrowing date until a date one week  two weeks or one  two  three or six months thereafter  as selected by us  at the corresponding eurodollar rate plus a margin of to depending upon our credit rating  and base rate loans will bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate equal to i the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate  and c a daily rate equal to the one month eurodollar rate plus  plus ii a margin that varies according to our credit rating 
swing line loans will bear interest at either the base rate described above or the daily floating eurodollar rate  which is a one month eurodollar rate plus the applicable margin  as selected by us 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage ratios 
the credit agreement also restricts payment of dividends or other return of capital when the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds a stated level amount 
at october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants of the credit agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital 
in connection with our entry into the credit agreement  we terminated the prior credit agreement and used a portion of the proceeds available under the credit agreement to repay our million term loan credit agreement  dated as of october  the further term loan  which was to have matured in june the further term loan was drawn in full on february   in conjunction with the settlement of the imm tender offer
