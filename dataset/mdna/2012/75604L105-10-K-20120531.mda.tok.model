item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly performance 
our reald eyewear may  in the future  be regulated by the food and drug administration  or fda  or by other state or foreign governmental or regulatory agencies  which could increase our costs and materially and adversely impact our profitability 
currently  polarized d eyewear  including our reald eyewear  is not regulated by the fda  or by state or foreign governmental and regulatory agencies 
however  certain eyewear  such as non prescription reading glasses and sunglasses  are considered to be medical devices by the fda and are subject to regulations imposed by the fda and various state and foreign governmental and regulatory agencies 
with the rising popularity of polarized d eyewear  there has been an increasing level of public scrutiny examining its potential health risks 
polarized d eyewear  including our reald eyewear  may at some point be subject to federal  state or foreign regulations that could potentially restrict how our reald eyewear is produced  used or marketed  and the cost of complying with those regulations may adversely affect our profitability 
if d viewing with active or passive eyewear is found to cause health risks or consumers believe that it does  demand for the d viewing experience may decrease or we may become subject to liability  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  business and prospects 
research conducted by institutions unrelated to us has suggested that d viewing with active or passive eyewear may cause vision fatigue  eye strain  discomfort  headaches  motion sickness  dizziness  nausea  epileptic seizures  strokes  disorientation  perceptual after effects  decreased postural stability or other health risks in some consumers 
if these potential health risks are substantiated or consumers believe in their validity  demand for the d viewing experience in the theater  the home and elsewhere may decline 
as a result  major motion picture studios and other content producers and distributors may refrain from developing d content  motion picture exhibitors may reduce the number of d enabled screens including reald enabled screens they currently deploy or plan to deploy  or they may reduce the number of d motion pictures exhibited in their theaters  which would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
a decline in consumer demand may also lead consumer electronics manufacturers and content distributors to reduce or abandon the production of d products  which could adversely affect our prospects and financial condition 
in addition  if health risks associated with our reald eyewear materialize  we may become subject to governmental regulation or product liability claims  including claims for personal injury 
successful assertion against us of one or a series of large claims could materially harm our business 
also  if our reald eyewear is found to be defective  we may be required to recall it  which may result in substantial expense and adverse publicity that could adversely impact our sales  operating results and reputation 
potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance coverage or may be excluded 
table of contents under the terms of the policy  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  we may also be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and business 
even meritless product liability claims could be expensive to resolve and may divert our management s attention 
our agreements with motion picture studios domestically and motion picture exhibitors internationally require us to manage the supply chain of our reald eyewear  and any interruption to the supply chain for our reald eyewear components could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  business and prospects 
our reald eyewear is an integral part of our reald cinema systems 
we have entered into non exclusive agreements with several manufacturers to produce reald eyewear 
we manage manufacturing  distribution and recycling of reald eyewear for motion picture studios and exhibitors worldwide 
domestically  we generally provide our reald eyewear free of charge to motion picture exhibitors and then receive a fee from the motion picture studios for the usage of that reald eyewear by the motion picture exhibitors customers 
most international motion picture exhibitors and some domestic motion picture exhibitors purchase reald eyewear directly from us and sell them to consumers as part of their admission or as a concession item 
any interruption in the supply of reald eyewear from manufacturers  increase in shipping cost  logistics or recycling interruption  other disruption to our global supply chain or competitive pricing pressures could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  business and prospects 
for example  in connection with recent major d motion picture releases and increased consumer demand  we have in the past exhausted our inventory of reald eyewear and incurred increased shipping costs to accelerate delivery 
our reald d eyewear business model in north america relies on fees from motion picture studios for the usage of reald eyewear by motion picture exhibitors customers  the uncertainty and any potential dispute between motion picture studios and exhibitors could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  business and prospects 
our reald eyewear is an integral part of our reald cinema systems 
domestically  we provide our reald eyewear free of charge to motion picture exhibitors and then receive a fee from the motion picture studios for the usage of that reald eyewear by the motion picture exhibitors customers 
most international motion picture exhibitors purchase reald eyewear directly from us and sell them to customers as part of their admission or as a concession 
we understand that at least one major motion picture studio is seeking a change to the d eyewear business model in north america to resemble the international model 
while we support multiple business models for our reald eyewear around the world  the uncertainty and any potential dispute between motion picture studios and exhibitors over the domestic eyewear business model could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  business and prospects 
in addition  we expect that current profitability in our reald eyewear business may not be sustainable  as motion picture studios with whom we do business seek to recover our cost savings and efficiencies in the form of reduced prices for eyewear 
economic conditions beyond our control could reduce consumer demand for motion pictures and consumer electronics using our d technologies and  as a result  could materially and adversely affect our business  revenue and growth prospects 
the global economic environment since late has been volatile and continues to pose risks 
the economy could remain significantly challenged for an indeterminate period of time 
present economic conditions could lead to a decrease in discretionary consumer spending  resulting in lower motion picture box office revenue 
in the event of declining box office revenue  motion picture studios may be less willing to release d motion pictures and motion picture exhibitors may be less willing to 
table of contents license our reald cinema systems 
further  a decrease in discretionary consumer spending may adversely affect future demand for d consumer electronics products that may use our d technologies and consumer electronics manufacturers may decide to limit  delay or cease their use of our d technologies  any of which could cause our business  revenue and growth prospects to suffer 
the loss of members of our management or research and development teams could substantially disrupt our business operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued individual and collective contributions of our management and research and development teams 
a limited number of individuals have primary responsibility for managing our business  including our relationships with motion picture studios and exhibitors and consumer electronics manufacturers and the research and development of our d technologies 
the loss of any of these individuals  including michael v 
lewis  our chairman and chief executive officer  or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms  could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business 
in addition  because we operate in a highly competitive industry  our hiring of qualified executives  scientists  engineers or other personnel may cause us or those persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets  improper solicitation of employees  breach of contract or other claims 
our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards could be subject to additional limitation if our ownership has changed or will change by more than  which could potentially result in increased future tax liability 
while currently subject to certain valuation allowances for purposes of preparing our consolidated financial statements see the discussion under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates deferred tax asset valuation and tax exposures in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  we intend to use our us net operating loss carryforwards to reduce any future us corporate income tax liability associated with our operations 
section of the us internal revenue code of  as amended  generally imposes an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset taxable income when a corporation has undergone significant changes in stock ownership 
we have not determined whether such ownership change has previously occurred 
it is possible that our initial public offering  or ipo  either on a standalone basis or when combined with past or future transactions including  but not limited to  significant increases during the applicable testing period in the percentage of our stock owned directly or constructively by i any stockholder who owns or more of our stock or ii some or all of the group of stockholders who individually own less than of our stock  will cause us to undergo one or more ownership changes 
in that event  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards could be adversely affected 
to the extent our use of net operating loss carryforwards is significantly limited under the rules of section as a result of our ipo or otherwise  our income could be subject to us corporate income tax earlier than it would if we were able to use net operating loss carryforwards  which could result in lower profits 
prior to the fiscal year ended march   we had a history of net losses and may suffer losses in the future 
while we were profitable in the fiscal year ended march   we incurred net losses in our fiscal years ended   and if we cannot maintain profitability  our financial condition will deteriorate  and we may be unable to achieve our business objectives 

table of contents risks related to owning our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
shares of our common stock were sold in our ipo in july at a price of per share  and  as of may   our common stock has subsequently traded as high as and as low as

volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares or at all 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons  which include our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors  the public s reaction to our press releases  our other public announcements and our filings with the sec  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stock of our competitors  new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business  changes in accounting standards  policies  guidance  interpretations or principles  changes in general conditions in the domestic and global economies or financial markets  including those resulting from war  incidents of terrorism or responses to such events  litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors  strategic action by our competitors  and sales of common stock by our directors  executive officers and significant stockholders 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and media companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
in addition  in the past  following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies 
if litigation is instituted against us  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources even if such litigation is without merit 
sales of outstanding shares of our common stock or shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of stock options into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well

of this  approximately was beneficially owned by michael v 
lewis  our chairman and chief executive officer  and approximately was beneficially owned by joshua greer  our co founder and member of our board of directors 
these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to control  or have significant influence over  the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  these stockholders  acting together  have the ability to control  or have significant influence over  the management and affairs of our company 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership might harm the market price of our common stock by delaying  deferring or preventing a change in corporate control  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving us  or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
as a public company  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis  and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
as a public company  the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
in particular  we need to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
our testing  or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm  may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses 
our compliance with section requires that we expend significant management time on compliance related issues 
moreover  if we are not able to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses  the market price of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the sec or other regulatory authorities  which could require additional financial and management resources

our board of directors has the authority  without action or vote of our stockholders  to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock  including shares issuable upon the exercise of options  shares that may be issued to satisfy our obligations under our equity incentive plans  shares that may be issued in connection with our acquisition of other companies  assets or technology  or shares of our authorized but unissued preferred stock 
issuances of common stock or preferred voting stock could reduce your influence over matters on which our stockholders vote and  in the case of issuances of preferred stock  likely could result in your interest in us being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock 
in addition  any future issuance of capital stock by us will dilute your economic interest in our company

if securities or industry analysts cease to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline

adjusted ebitda is a non us gaap financial measure 
adjusted ebitda is a supplemental measure of our performance 
however  adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us gaap 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss  plus net interest expense  income and other taxes  depreciation and amortization  share based compensation expense and exhibitor option expense  as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations for that period 
non us gaap adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with us gaap are itemized below 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 

table of contents set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss for the following periods indicated year ended in thousands march  march  march  net income loss add deduct interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization other income loss share based compensation expense exhibitor option expense impairment of assets and intangibles sales and use tax property tax management fee adjusted ebitda includes amortization of debt issue costs and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses and gain on sale of digital projectors 
represents share based compensation expense of nonstatutory and incentive stock options and restricted stock units to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
represents stock options granted to some of our motion picture exhibitor licensees 
the amounts are recorded as contra revenue in the consolidated financial statements 
represents impairment of long lived assets  such as fixed assets  theatrical equipment and identifiable intangibles 
represents taxes incurred by us for cinema license and product revenue 
represents property taxes on reald cinema systems and digital projectors 
represents payment of management fees to our series c mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stockholder included in general and administrative expense  which were terminated upon the completion of our ipo 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda in developing our internal budgets  forecasts and strategic plan  in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies in evaluating potential acquisitions  in making compensation decisions and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool which include  among others  the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  
table of contents adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  adjusted ebitda also differs from the amounts calculated under the similarly titled definition in our credit agreement  which is further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non cash charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities  such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with us gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only as a supplement

key business metrics our management regularly reviews a number of business metrics  including the following key metrics to evaluate our business  monitor the performance of our business model  identify trends affecting our business  determine the allocation of resources  make decisions regarding corporate strategies and evaluate forward looking projections 
the measures that we believe are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual performance are as follows number of screens 
domestic screens are motion picture theater screens in the united states or canada enabled with our reald cinema systems 
international screens are motion picture theater screens outside the united states and canada enabled with our reald cinema systems 
number of locations 
domestic locations are motion picture exhibition complexes in the united states or canada with one or more screens enabled with our reald cinema systems

adjusted ebitda 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss  plus net interest expense  income and other 
table of contents taxes  depreciation and amortization  share based compensation expense and exhibitor option expense  as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
we consider our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations for that period

if we are successful in expanding our business with consumer electronics manufacturers and content producers and distributors to incorporate our reald format and display technologies into their products and platforms  our key business metrics in future periods may include the number of units of d enabled plasma and lcd televisions  interactive gaming consoles and laptop computers shipped in that period 
to date  we have not generated significant revenue in our consumer electronics business 
opportunities  trends and factors affecting comparability we have rapidly evolved and expanded our business since we acquired colorlink in march this expansion has included hiring most of our senior management team  acquiring and growing our research and development facilities in boulder  colorado  and building infrastructure to support our business 
these investments in and changes to our business have allowed us to significantly increase our revenue and key business metrics 
we expect to continue to invest for the foreseeable future in expanding our business as we increase our direct sales and marketing presence in the united states  europe  asia and other geographic regions  enhance and expand our technology and product offerings and pursue strategic acquisitions 
cinema the shift in the motion picture industry from analog to digital over the past decade has created an opportunity for new and transformative d technologies 
the growth in d screens worldwide combined with growth in the number of d motion pictures has led to an increase in the worldwide box office generated by d screens in recent years 
in  d enabled screens generated an 
table of contents estimated billion in worldwide d box office according to provisional figures from screen digest  representing of the billion in total worldwide box office in seven of the top grossing films worldwide in were exhibited in reald d 
as of march   there were approximately  reald enabled screens worldwide as compared to approximately  reald enabled screens worldwide as of march   an increase of  reald enabled screens or 
based on the slate announcements by motion picture studios  we anticipate that approximately d motion pictures will be released worldwide in our fiscal year  including sequels to successful major motion picture franchises  such as men in black  madagascar  spider man  and ice age  as well as highly anticipated original content such as the avengers  prometheus  brave and the hobbit 
consumer electronics we make available our reald display  active and passive eyewear  reald format technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers and content distributors to enable d in high definition televisions  laptops and other displays in the home and elsewhere 
we believe that the recent success of major d motion pictures  including transformers dark of the moon  harry potter and the deathly hallows part ii  pirates of the caribbean  thor  kung fu panda and the avengers is leading to the creation and distribution of d content for consumer electronics 
the development of these technologies represents a significant opportunity for new revenue 
motion picture exhibitor stock options we have incurred variability in our license revenue and operating results in the past and during the period covered by this annual report on form k in connection with stock options issued to some of our motion picture exhibitor licensees that vest upon the achievement of screen installation targets 
all of these screen installation targets have been achieved  all associated reduction of revenue has been recognized and the motion picture exhibitor stock options have vested in full as of march  for further discussion regarding exhibitor stock options  see key components of our results of operations revenue motion picture exhibitor stock options and critical accounting policies and estimates 
key components of our results of operations revenue we derive substantially all of our revenue from the license of our reald cinema systems and the use and sale of our reald eyewear 
we license our reald cinema systems in multi year typically five years or longer agreements that are generally exclusive with our motion picture exhibitor licensees in both the domestic and international markets 
our license agreements for our reald cinema systems are typically structured on a per admission  periodic fixed fee  or per motion picture basis 
currently  our license revenue is derived principally on a per admission basis 
we generate product revenue from the distribution of reald eyewear to motion picture studios and exhibitors worldwide 
domestically  we provide our reald eyewear free of charge to motion picture exhibitors and then receive a fee from the motion picture studios for the usage of that reald eyewear by the motion picture exhibitors consumers 
most international motion picture exhibitors purchase reald eyewear directly from us and sell them to consumers as part of their admission or as a concession item 
product revenue is principally derived from the use and sale of reald eyewear 
international revenue is primarily earned in europe  central and latin america  asia and australia 

table of contents our cinema business is strongly tied to the release of d motion pictures 
these motion pictures tend to be released based on specific consumer entertainment dynamics  which results in seasonal patterns  with the largest number of motion pictures typically being released in the summer and early winter 
although we have not yet generated material revenue licensing d consumer electronics technologies  we expect to derive revenue from the licensing of our reald display  active and passive eyewear  reald format and technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers and content producers and distributors 
as a result  we expect a portion of our revenue growth in the future to be affected by consumer electronics  including the impact of supply chain timelines of the major consumer electronics manufacturers 
we record revenue net of motion picture exhibitor stock options  as discussed more fully immediately below  and estimated revenue allowances 
upfront payments for the purchase of reald eyewear and license fees associated with certain motion picture exhibitor license agreements are recorded as deferred revenue until the applicable revenue recognition criteria are met 
motion picture exhibitor stock options 
in connection with some of our motion picture exhibitor license agreements  we issued to three motion picture exhibitors year options to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
the stock options vested upon the achievement of screen installation targets  which have all been achieved 
the stock options do not have net cash settlement features 
motion picture exhibitor stock options are valued at the underlying stock price during each reporting period 
as of march   all  motion picture exhibitor stock options had vested and all associated reduction of revenue has been recognized 
amounts recorded as revenue reduction totaled million and million for the years ended march  and march   respectively 
there were no amounts recorded as revenue reduction related to exhibitor options for the year ended march  cost of revenue and operating expenses cost of revenue principally consists of depreciation expense of our reald cinema systems deployed at a motion picture exhibitor s premises  digital projector depreciation expenses  reald eyewear costs including shipping  handling and recycling costs  field service and support costs and occupancy costs 
we classify our operating expenses into three categories research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative 
personnel costs include salaries  bonuses  benefits and share based compensation 
we allocate share based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of the fair value of stock options granted based on how we categorize the department in which the stock option holder works 
research and development 
research and development costs principally consist of personnel costs related to our research and development staff  depreciation and amortization of research and development assets  prototype and materials costs  the cost of third party service providers supporting our research and development efforts and occupancy costs

the decrease in our net product revenue in the fiscal year ended march   as compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily a result of a decrease in eyewear sold to our international markets

noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest represents a interest in our subsidiary  digital link ii  llc  or digital link ii

the increase in the net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was primarily due to the gain from the sale of digital projectors for the year ended march  seasonality and quarterly performance our operations are generally subject to seasonal trends based on the number of d motion pictures released and the box office of those d motion pictures 
as is the case with other participants in the motion picture exhibition industry  we expect that our fiscal quarters during the summer and early winter holiday periods generally will tend to show stronger box office performance and higher revenues due to the summer and holiday movie going seasons  when many of the largest grossing films in any given year are typically released 
by comparison  the quarter ending in march traditionally does not benefit from the same box office performance due to the number and nature of the motion 
table of contents pictures released in those seasonal periods 
we expect to experience seasonal fluctuations in results of operations as a result of these trends 
our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors that may cause our operating results to vary or fluctuate include those discussed in part i  item a below under the caption risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception and through march   we have financed our operations through the proceeds we received in connection with our ipo  the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock  borrowings under our previous credit facility agreement with city national bank  a national banking association  or city national  and through the issuance of notes payable to stockholders and vendors  and net cash provided by operating activities 
our cash flow from operating activities has historically been significantly impacted by the contractual payment terms and patterns related to the license of our reald cinema systems and use and sale of our reald eyewear  as well as significant investments in research  development  selling and marketing activities and corporate infrastructure 
prior to fiscal  many of our licensing and product sale contracts included terms that required upfront payments 
since a majority of our revenue recognized under our motion picture exhibitor licenses results in admission and usage fees being paid to us subsequent to such consumer attendance  we expect our deferred revenue balances to continue to decline over the next several years 
cash provided by operating activities is expected to be a primary recurring source of funds in future periods and will be driven by our expected increased revenue generated from the growing number of d motion pictures exhibited on our reald cinema systems and an increase in the number of reald enabled screens  partially offset by increased working capital requirements associated with installing new reald cinema systems  logistics and recycling costs for our reald eyewear 
depending on our operating performance in any given period and the installation rate of additional reald cinema systems  we expect to supplement our liquidity needs primarily with borrowings under our secured credit facility 
we recently entered into a secured credit facility agreement with city national to provide us with a revolving credit facility including a letter of credit sub facility in a maximum amount not to exceed  the revolving facility  and a delayed draw term loan facility in a maximum amount not to exceed  the term loan facility the revolving facility and the term loan facility replace existing revolving and term loan facilities provided under our pre existing credit and security agreement with city national  which had been most recently amended on december  our obligations under our secured credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our subsidiaries  colorlink inc  a delaware corporation colorlink  and stereographics corporation  a california corporation stereographics 
we intend to borrow additional amounts under our secured credit facility to fund various growth initiatives  including accelerated research and product development  acquisitions  capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
we expect that we will maintain a significant amount of indebtedness on an ongoing basis 
our revolving facility matures on april   and the term loan facility matures the last day of the twelfth th full fiscal quarter after the earlier of october  or the date that aggregate term loan commitments have been drawn in full  which maturity dates may  in each case  be accelerated in certain circumstances 

table of contents on december   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement to provide that the aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time under our revolving credit loans shall remain million after december  and to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit loans under the credit agreement to december  as of march   our primary sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents of million and our credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility of up to million through december   million of which was available for borrowing 
during the year ended march   we received million in cash and had million of accounts receivable from motion picture exhibitors from the sale of digital projectors  resulting in a gain of million in other income loss 
on july   we completed the initial public offering of our common stock  or our ipo  in which we sold and issued million shares of common stock at an issue price of per share

increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses were due to increased business activities at fiscal year end  resulting in significant amounts due to vendors and compensation payable to employees that were not paid until after the fiscal year end 
accounts receivable increased as a result of an increase in revenue 
cash flow from investing activities and capital resources for fiscal years  and  cash outflow for investing activities is primarily related to the establishment of our initial infrastructure and for the purchase of component parts for our reald cinema systems  digital projectors  and other property  equipment and leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  in the future  we will continue to invest in our business to grow sales and develop new products and support the related increasing employee headcount

we enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries 
non us gaap discussion in addition to our us gaap results  we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance 
however  adjusted ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us gaap 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss  plus net interest expense  income and other taxes  depreciation and amortization  share based compensation expense and exhibitor option expense  as further adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain other items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance 
management considers our core operating performance to be that which can be affected by our managers in any particular period through their management of the resources that affect our underlying revenue and profit generating operations that period 
non us gaap adjustments to our results prepared in accordance with us gaap are itemized below 
you are encouraged to evaluate these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis 
in evaluating adjusted ebitda  you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation 
our presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items 

table of contents set forth below is a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss for the following periods indicated year ended in thousands march  march  march  net income loss add deduct interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization other income loss share based compensation expense exhibitor option expense impairment of assets and intangibles sales and use tax property tax management fee adjusted ebitda includes amortization of debt issue costs and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains and losses and gain on sale of digital projectors 
represents share based compensation expense of nonstatutory and incentive stock options and restricted stock units to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
represents stock options granted to some of our motion picture exhibitor licensees 
the amounts are recorded as contra revenue in the consolidated financial statements 
represents impairment of long lived assets  such as fixed assets  theatrical equipment and identifiable intangibles 
represents taxes incurred by us for cinema license and product revenue 
represents property taxes on reald cinema systems and digital projectors 
represents payment of management fees to our series c mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stockholder included in general and administrative expense  which were terminated upon the completion of our ipo 
we present adjusted ebitda because we believe it assists investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance 
in addition  we use adjusted ebitda in developing our internal budgets  forecasts and strategic plan  in analyzing the effectiveness of our business strategies  to evaluate potential acquisitions  in making compensation decisions  and in communications with our board of directors concerning our financial performance 
adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  
table of contents adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debts  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it as an expense when evaluating our ongoing operating performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the impact of certain cash charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  adjusted ebitda also differs from the amounts calculated under the similarly titled definition in our credit agreement  which is further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non cash charges and is used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities  such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments  and other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with us gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our us gaap results and using adjusted ebitda only as a supplement 
our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion in this item is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates and judgments are evaluated  including those related to revenue recognition  revenue deductions  product returns  fair value of our common stock  share based compensation  inventories  definite lived asset impairments  goodwill impairment and income taxes 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and revenue reductions we derive substantially all of our revenue from the license of our reald cinema systems and the international product sale of  or fees received domestically related to  our reald eyewear 
we evaluate revenue recognition for transactions using the criteria set forth by the sec in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab and accounting standards codification topic  revenue recognition asc 
the revenue recognition guidance states that revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or 
table of contents services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
license revenue 
license revenue is accounted for as an operating lease 
license revenue is primarily derived under per admission  periodic fixed fee  or per motion picture basis with motion picture exhibitors 
amounts received up front  less estimated allowances  are deferred and recognized over the lease term using the straight line method 
additional lease payments that are contingent upon future events outside our control  including those related to admission and usage  are recognized as revenues when the contingency is resolved and we have no more obligations to our customers specific to the contingent payment received 
certain of our license revenue from leasing our reald cinema systems is earned upon admission by the motion picture exhibitor s consumers 
our licensees  however  do not report and pay for such license revenue until after the admission has occurred  which may be received subsequent to our fiscal period end 
we estimate and record licensing revenue related to motion picture exhibitor consumer admissions in the fiscal quarter in which the admission occurs  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
we determine that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement upon the execution of a license agreement or upon the receipt of a licensee s admissions report 
revenue is deemed fixed or determinable upon receipt of a licensee s admissions report 
we determine collectability based on an evaluation of the licensee s recent payment history 
product revenue 
we recognize product revenue  net of allowances  when title and risk of loss have passed and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the payment is fixed or determinable  and collectability of payment is reasonably assured 
in the united states and canada  certain of our product revenue from the sale of our reald eyewear is earned upon admission and usage by the motion picture exhibitor s consumers 
our customers  however  do not report admission or usage information until after the admission and usage has occurred  and such information may be received subsequent to our fiscal period end 
we estimate and record such product revenue in the quarter in which the admission and usage occurs  but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts can be made 
revenue reductions 
we record revenue net of motion picture exhibitor stock options and estimated revenue allowances 
in connection with certain exhibitor licensing agreements  we issued the motion picture exhibitors a year option to purchase shares of our common stock at approximately per share 
the stock options vest upon the achievement of screen installation targets 
motion picture exhibitor stock options are valued at the underlying stock price at each reporting period until the targets are met 
amounts recognized are based on the number of reald enabled screens as a percentage of total screen installation targets 
the stock options do not have net cash settlement features 
amounts recorded as a revenue reduction totaled million for the year ended march  and million for the year ended march  there were no amounts recorded as a revenue reduction for the year ended march  as of march   all  motion picture exhibitor stock options had vested and all associated reduction of revenue had been recognized 
share based compensation we account for stock options  performance stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees and directors by recording compensation expense based on estimated fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
share based awards are attributed to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period 
we determine the value of each option award that contains a market condition using a lattice based option valuation model  while all other option awards are valued using the black scholes valuation model as permitted under accounting standards 
table of contents codification topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates based on management judgment and subjective future expectations 
our estimates of the fair values of stock options granted and the resulting amounts of share based compensation recognized may be impacted by certain variables including stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors  additional stock option grants  modifications  estimates of forfeitures and the related income tax impact 
if any of the assumptions used in our valuation models significantly change  share based compensation for future awards may differ materially from the awards granted previously 
inventories domestically  we provide our reald eyewear free of charge to motion picture exhibitors and then receive a fee from the motion picture studios for the usage of that reald eyewear by the motion picture exhibitors consumers 
for reald eyewear located at a motion picture exhibitor  we believe that it is not operationally practical to perform physical counts or request the motion picture exhibitor to perform physical counts and confirm quantities held to ensure that losses due to damage  destruction  and shrinkage are specifically recognized in the period incurred due to the number of domestic reald enabled screens and related usage of reald eyewear 
we believe that the cost to monitor shrinkage or usage significantly outweighs the financial reporting benefits of using a specific identification methodology of expensing 
we believe that utilizing a composite method of expensing reald eyewear inventory costs provides a rational and reasonable approach to ensuring that shrinkage is provided for in the period incurred and that inventory costs are expensed in the periods that reasonably reflect the periods in which the related revenue is recognized 
in doing so  we believe the following methodology reasonably and generally reflects periodic income or loss under these facts and circumstances for an estimated period of time following shipment to domestic motion picture exhibitors  no expense is recognized between the time of shipment and until the delivery is made as the inventory unit is in transit and unused 
the inventory unit cost is expensed on a straight line basis over an estimated usage period beginning when we believe usage of the inventory unit has started 
in estimating the expensing start date and related expense period  we consider various factors including  but not limited to  those relating to a d motion picture s opening release date  a d motion picture s expected release period  the number of currently playing d motion pictures  the motion picture exhibitor s ordering and stocking patterns and practices and the quantities shipped per inventory unit 
we believe that the expensing methodology described above rationally and reasonably approximates the period the related usage occurs resulting in our reald eyewear product revenue 
the expensing start date following the date of shipment is meant to approximate the date at which usage begins 
additionally  as the expense recognition period has been and is expected to continue to be short  we believe it adequately recognizes inventory impairments due to loss and damage on a timely basis 
we further believe that exposures due to loss or damage  if any  are considered normal shrinkage and a necessary and expected cost to generate the revenue per d motion picture earned through reald eyewear usage 
we continue to monitor the reasonableness of this methodology to ensure that it approximates the period over which the related reald eyewear product revenue is earned and realizable 
reald eyewear inventory costs that have not yet been expensed are reported as deferred costs eyewear 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as property and equipment  cinema systems  digital projectors and intangibles  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors or circumstances that could indicate the occurrence of such events include current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing operating or cash flow losses  or incurring costs in excess of amounts originally expected to acquire or construct an asset 
if the asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recognized as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill impairment goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and therefore is not amortized 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment using a two step process that is performed at least annually during our fourth fiscal quarter  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the first step is a comparison of the fair value of an internal reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step is unnecessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the goodwill to a determination of the implied value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill is greater than the implied value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
we currently have one reporting unit in which goodwill resides and the reporting unit is not at risk of failing step one 
deferred tax asset valuation and tax exposures in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect our accounting for income taxes 
this process includes estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  including the timing of recognition of share based compensation expense  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we have established a valuation allowance 
we assess realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence in order to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
available evidence considered by us includes  but is not limited to  our historic operating results  projected future operating results  reversing temporary differences  changing business circumstances  and the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets through loss and tax credit carry back and carry forward strategies 
as of march   we have determined based on the weight of the available evidence  both positive and negative  to provide for a valuation allowance against substantially all of the net deferred tax assets 
the current deferred tax assets not reserved for by the valuation allowance are those in foreign jurisdictions whereby future realization is more likely than not to be obtained 
if there is a change in circumstances that causes a change in judgment about the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we will adjust all or a portion of the applicable valuation allowance in the period when such change occurs 
we are subject to ongoing tax exposures  examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  we may incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such matters 
in addition  when applicable  we adjust tax expense to reflect our ongoing assessments of such matters which require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective rate as well as impact operating results 

table of contents significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and uncertainty in income tax positions 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 
contingencies and assessments we are subject to various loss contingencies and assessments arising in the course of our business  some of which relate to litigation  claims  property taxes and sales and use or goods and services tax assessments 
we consider the likelihood of the loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss  contingencies and assessments 
an estimated loss contingency or assessment is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
based on the information presently available  including discussion with counsel and other consultants  management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

table of contents the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have operations outside the united states 
we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks primarily include interest rate  foreign exchange and inflation risks as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business 
to reduce certain of these risks  we monitor the financial condition of our large customers and limit credit exposure as we deem appropriate 
in addition  our investment strategy currently has been to invest in financial instruments that are highly liquid  readily convertible into cash and which mature within three months from the date of purchase 
we also enter into foreign exchange derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program 
for accounting purposes  we do not designate any of our derivative instruments as hedges and we do not use derivatives for speculating trading purposes and are not a party to leveraged derivatives 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
our investments are considered cash equivalents and primarily consist of money market funds 
at march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  however  we do not believe an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio  and therefore we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 
we do not believe our cash equivalents have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
while we believe our cash equivalents do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
the revolving credit facility provides for  at our option  revolving london interbank offered rate libor loans  which bear interest at the greater of three and one half percent or the libor plus two and one half percent or revolving prime loans which bear interest at the greater of three and one half percent or the fluctuating prime rate per annum 
changes in interest rates do not affect operating results or cash flows on our fixed rate borrowings but would impact our variable rate borrowings 
at march   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of march   borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement bear interest at 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar 
our historical revenue has generally been denominated in united states dollars  and a significant portion of our current revenue continues to be denominated 
table of contents in united states dollars  however  we expect an increasing portion of our future revenue to be denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  primarily the euro  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  various latin american currencies  japanese yen  chinese yuan and hong kong dollar 
our operating expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located  primarily the united states and united kingdom 
increases and decreases in our international revenue from movements in foreign exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses 
to further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts 
we had outstanding forward contracts based in british pound sterling  canadian dollar and the euro with notional amounts totaling million as of march  and million as of march  the net gain loss related to the change in fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was not significant for the years ended march   march  and march  with regard to these contracts  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates on march  would result in a million reduction in fair value of these forward contracts and a corresponding foreign currency loss of approximately million 
this analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions and assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
as our international operations grow  our risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates will become greater  and we will continue to reassess our approach to managing this risk 
in addition  currency fluctuations or a weakening united states dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion 
as our international operations grow  we expect to conduct more of our business in currencies other than the us dollar  thereby increasing risks associated with fluctuation in currency rates 
currency fluctuations or a weakening united states dollar can increase the costs of our international expansion 
as our exposure to currency risks grows  we will continue to reassess our risk management 
inflation risk we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
counterparty risk our financial statements  including derivatives  are subject to counterparty credit risk  which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through credit monitoring procedures
