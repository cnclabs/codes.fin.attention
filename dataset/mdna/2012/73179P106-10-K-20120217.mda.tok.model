liquidity and capital resources our objective is to finance our business through operating cash flow and the appropriate mix of debt 
by diversifying the maturity structure  we avoid concentrations of debt  reducing liquidity risk 
we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and or exchanges for equity securities  in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
we may also seek to repurchase our outstanding equity securities 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
the following table summarizes our liquidity as of december  as of december in millions cash and cash equivalents revolving credit availability liquidity on december   we entered into a senior secured term loan facility  maturing december   having an aggregate principal amount of million 
we used the net proceeds from the term loan to partially fund the acquisition of colormatrix 
the interest rate per annum under the term loan is  at polyone s option  either libor subject to a floor or a prime rate  plus an applicable margin percentage 
the applicable margin is variable based upon our leverage ratio being greater than x 
the current libor and prime rates margin are and  respectively  per annum 
the effective interest rate  including deferred financing costs  on the term loan was during the term loan agreement contains customary covenants including various financial covenants 
the financial covenants include an interest coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio  and maximum capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  on december   we retired our accounts receivable facility that was set to mature in june and replaced it with a five year senior secured revolving credit facility  which includes up to million in revolving loans  subject to a borrowing base with advances against us and canadian accounts receivable and inventory 
we have the option to increase the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to million  subject to our meeting certain requirements and obtaining commitments for such increase 
polyone corporation the interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility will be  at polyone s option  equal to either i a base rate or ii libor  for one  two or three month interest periods  in each case plus an applicable margin percentage 
the margin is variable based upon our quarterly excess availability 
the current margin percentage is i per annum in the case of base rate advances  ii per annum in the case of libor rate advances 
the agreement governing the revolving credit facility contains customary covenants including maximum capital expenditures and a financial covenant to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of x  which only comes into effect when excess availability falls below of the maximum credit 
the revolving credit facility also requires the payment of an unused commitment fee of per annum prior to april   and subsequent to april  if the average daily balance is less than of the maximum facility and per annum if the average daily balance is equal to or greater than of the maximum facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants  there were no outstanding borrowings and we had availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
for additional information about our financing arrangements  see note  financing arrangements  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   approximately of the company s cash and cash equivalents reside outside the united states 
repatriation of these funds could be negatively impacted by potential foreign and domestic taxes 
based on current projections  we believe that we will be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures and that cash provided by operating activities  along with available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  should allow us to maintain adequate levels of available capital resources to fund our operations and meet debt service and minimum pension funding requirements for both the short term and long term 
we expect to maintain existing levels of available capital resources and meet our cash requirements in expected sources of cash in include cash from operations  available funding under our revolving credit facility if needed  cash earn outs from previously owned equity affiliates and proceeds from the sale of previously closed facilities and redundant assets 
expected uses of cash in include interest payments  cash taxes  contributions to our defined benefit pension plan  dividend payments  potential share repurchases  environmental remediation at inactive and formerly owned sites and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be approximately million to million in  primarily to support sales growth  our continued investment in recent acquisitions  and other strategic investments 
cash flows the following summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities 
in millions cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate on cash net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million in the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities year over year of million is principally related to higher taxes paid during  higher compensation payments in primarily related to performance  higher insurance and legal settlements received in the prior year and higher interest income receipts related to notes receivable in the prior year  offset partially by improved working capital 
excluding colormatrix  working capital as a percentage of sales  which we define as accounts receivable  plus inventory  less accounts payable  divided by sales remained consistent at for the years ended december  and days sales outstanding as of december  and december  was we excluded colormatrix from our working capital and days sales outstanding calculations as the purchased working capital  including accounts receivable  were brought into our financial statements without the associated sales  at the time of acquisition 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was million as compared to million in in  working capital increased reflecting our investment in support of our sales growth 
we invested in working capital to ensure adequate supply of certain raw materials and to improve our on time delivery to customers 
as a percentage of sales  year over year working capital continued to improve  decreasing from for to for days sales outstanding at december  was relatively consistent with days sales outstanding at december   increasing slightly from to due primarily to a change in the mix of our customers payment terms 
polyone corporation investing activities net cash used by investing activities during of million reflects our acquisitions of colormatrix for million  net of cash acquired  and uniplen for million  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures of million  and an earn out payment of million related to our acquisition of new england urethane neu 
these cash out flows were offset by cash proceeds of million from the sale in our equity investment in sunbelt and other assets

capital expenditures are currently estimated to be approximately million to million in  primarily to support sales growth  our continued investment in recent acquisitions  and other strategic investments

additionally  we repaid our million credit facility and million aggregate principal amount of our medium term notes 
in connection with the tender offer  we paid tender premiums and other costs of million  and we paid million of costs associated with the extinguishment of the million credit facility 
net cash used by financing activities in reflects the repayment of short term debt and our medium term notes

aggregate maturities of long term debt for the next five years are million  million  million  million  million  and thereafter million 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  including foreign exchange contracts and trade accounts receivable  subject us to potential credit risk 
concentration of credit risk for trade accounts receivable is limited due to the large number of customers constituting our customer base and their distribution among many industries and geographic locations 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to forward foreign exchange contracts in the event of non performance by the counter parties to these financial instruments 
we believe that the risk of incurring material losses related to this credit risk is remote 
we do not require collateral to support the financial position of our credit risks 
guarantee of indebtedness of others on february   we sold our equity interest in sunbelt to olin for million in cash and the assumption by olin of the obligations under our guarantee of senior secured notes issued by sunbelt of million at the time of sale  million as of december  until the guarantee is formally assigned to olin  we remain obligated under the guarantee  although olin has agreed to indemnify us for amounts that we may be obligated to pay under the guarantee 
letters of credit our new revolving credit facility makes up to million available for the issuance of letters of credit  million of which was used at december  these letters of credit are issued by the bank in favor of third parties and are mainly related to insurance claims

represents estimated contractual interest payments for fixed rate debt only 
we are not able to estimate reasonably the cash payments for interest associated with variable rate debt due to the significant estimation required relating to both market interest rates as well as projected principal payments 
pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
the expected payments associated with these plans represent an actuarial estimate of future assumed payments based upon retirement and payment patterns 
due to uncertainties regarding the assumptions involved in estimating future required contributions to our pension and non pension postretirement benefit plans  including i interest rate levels  ii the amount and timing of asset returns  and iii what  if any  changes may occur in pension funding legislation  the estimates in the table may differ materially from actual future payments 
purchase obligations are primarily comprised of service agreements related to telecommunication  information technology  utilities and other manufacturing plant services and certain capital commitments 
the table also excludes the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits  since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
at december   the gross liability for unrecognized income tax benefits  including interest and penalties  totaled million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates effective january   we changed our method of recognizing actuarial gains and losses for pension and other postretirement benefits for all of our defined benefit plans 
historically  we recognized actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets on an annual basis and amortized them into our operating results over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participants for the majority of our us and foreign plans and over the remaining service period of plan participants for certain non us benefit plans  to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a corridor 
beginning in  we have elected to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses  after consideration of inventory capitalization  in our operating results in the year in which the gains or losses occur because it is generally preferable to accelerate the recognition of deferred gains and losses into income rather than to delay such recognition 
this change will improve the transparency in our operating results by more quickly recognizing the effects of economic and interest rate trends on plan obligations  investments and assumptions 
these gains and losses are generally only measured annually as of december and accordingly  will be recorded during the fourth quarter of each year 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  accounting changes and error corrections  all prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively 
the majority of our net periodic benefit cost is captured within corporate and eliminations and accordingly the annual recognition of actuarial gains and losses will be therin 
the effect of the change on retained earnings as of january  was a reduction of million  with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive income 
see note  change in accounting principle  for a presentation of our operating results before and after the application of this accounting change 
significant accounting policies are described more fully in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable considering the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
polyone corporation description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions pension and other post retirement plans we account for our defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement plans in accordance with fasb asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the value of future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we consider the duration of the plan liabilities and give more weight to equity investments than to fixed income securities 
the weighted average discount rates used to value our pension and other post retirement liabilities as of december  were and  respectively 
as of december   an increase decrease in the discount rate of basis points  holding all other assumptions constant  would have increased or decreased pre tax income and the related pension and post retirement liability by approximately million 
an increase decrease in the discount rate of basis points as of december  would result in a change of approximately million in net periodic benefit cost 
the weighted average expected return on assets was for  and the expected return on assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be measured over a long period based on past experience 
a variation in the expected return on assets by basis points as of december  would result in a change of approximately million in net periodic benefit cost 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired companies 
we follow the guidance in asc  intangibles goodwill and other  and test goodwill for impairment at least annually  absent a triggering event that would warrant an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of the first day of october of each year 
we have identified our reporting units at the operating segment level or in some cases one level below the operating segment level 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
we estimated fair value using the best information available to us  including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding projected economic and market conditions  growth rates  operating margins and cash expenditures 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to additional goodwill impairment charges 
based on our annual impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded the corresponding carrying value by at least 
in connection with the acquisition of colormatrix  we identified million of acquired in process research and development ipr d 
identified ipr d acquired in a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the project is complete 
upon completion projects are reclassified to technology and amortized over their useful lives 
we estimate fair value using the best information available to us  including market information and discounted cash flow projections also referred to as the income approach 
the income approach requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding projected economic and market conditions  growth rates  and operating margins 
no indicators of impairment were identified since the acquisition of colormatrix  december  at december   our balance sheet reflected million of indefinite lived tradename assets  which includes  million associated with the trade name acquired as part of the acquisition of gls and million associated with trade names acquired as part of the colormatrix acquisition 
we estimate the fair value of tradenames using a relief from royalty payments approach 
this approach involves two steps estimating reasonable royalty rate for the tradename and applying this royalty rate to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
fair value is then compared with the carrying value of the tradename 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be exposed to impairment charges related to our indefinite lived tradenames 
polyone corporation description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in addition  deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when realization of the benefit of deferred tax assets is not deemed to be more likely than not 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate recovery of certain of our deferred tax assets is dependent on the amount and timing of taxable income that we will ultimately generate in the future and other factors such as the interpretation of tax laws 
this means that significant estimates and judgments are required to determine the extent that valuation allowances should be provided against deferred tax assets 
we have provided valuation allowances as of december  aggregating million against such assets based on our current assessment of future operating results and these other factors 
although management believes that the estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  which could result in gains or losses that could be material 
we recognize net tax benefits under the recognition and measurement criteria of asc topic  income taxes  which prescribes requirements and other guidance for financial statement recognition and measurement of positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns 
we record interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
environmental liabilities based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from changes in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
if further developments or resolution of these matters are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may need to recognize a significant charge in a future period 
polyone corporation description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions share based compensation we have share based compensation plans that include non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance shares  performance units and stock appreciation rights sars 
see note  share based compensation  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  future employee turnover rates and risk free rate of return 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
for sars granted during and  the option pricing model used was the black scholes method 
we determine the fair value of our sars granted in based on a monte carlo simulation method 
we determine the fair value of our market based and performance based nonvested share awards at the date of grant using generally accepted valuation techniques 
polyone corporation future adoption of accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs asu 
asu generally provides a uniform framework for fair value measurements and related disclosures between us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
additional disclosure requirements in the update include for level fair value measurements  quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs  for an entity s use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the asset s highest and best use  the reason for the difference  for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required  the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined  and the disclosure of all transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
asu will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we will adopt the provisions of asu in the first quarter of  and do not believe the adoption of this update will materially impact our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu amends existing guidance by allowing only two options for presenting the components of net income and other comprehensive income in a single continuous financial statement  statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive financial statements  consisting of an income statement followed by a separate statement of other comprehensive income 
asu no 
requires retrospective application  and it is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt the provisions of asu in the first quarter of  and are currently evaluating which presentation option for the components of net income and other comprehensive income we will use 
polyone corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates on debt obligations and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use these derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure interest on our million term loan is currently based upon libor subject to a floor plus a margin 
interest on our revolving credit facility is currently based upon libor  plus a margin 
all other debt is at fixed rates 
there would be no impact on our interest expense or cash flows from either a increase or decrease in market rates of interest on our outstanding variable rate debt as of december   because libor is more than below the floor on our term loan and we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exposure we enter into intercompany lending transactions that are denominated in various foreign currencies and are subject to financial exposure from foreign exchange rate movement from the date a loan is recorded to the date it is settled or revalued 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts  which had a fair value of million at december  gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
we face translation risks related to the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the shareholders equity section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
net sales and expenses in our foreign operations foreign currencies are translated into varying amounts of us dollars depending upon whether the us dollar weakens or strengthens against other currencies 
therefore  changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our net sales and expenses from foreign operations as expressed in us dollars
