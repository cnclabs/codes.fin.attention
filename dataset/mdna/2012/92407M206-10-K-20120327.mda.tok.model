table of contents item business company overview we are dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of novel high value diagnostic tests that help physicians diagnose  treat and improve outcomes for patients 
our tests are intended to help guide decisions regarding patient treatment  which may include decisions to refer patients to specialists  to perform additional testing  or to assist in the selection of therapy 
a distinctive feature of our approach is to combine multiple biomarkers into a single  reportable index score that has higher diagnostic accuracy than its constituents 
we concentrate our development of novel diagnostic tests in the fields of oncology  cardiology and women s health  with the initial focus on ovarian cancer 
we also intend to address clinical questions related to early disease detection  treatment response  monitoring of disease progression  prognosis and others through collaborations with leading academic and research institutions 
our lead product  ova  was cleared by the united states food and drug administration fda on september  ova addresses a clear unmet clinical need  namely the pre surgical identification of women who are at high risk of having a malignant ovarian tumor 
numerous studies have documented the benefit of referral of these women to gynecologic oncologists for their initial surgery 
prior to the clearance of ova  no blood test had been cleared by the fda for physicians to use in the pre surgical management of ovarian adnexal masses 
ova is a qualitative serum test that utilizes five well established biomarkers and proprietary fda cleared software to determine the likelihood of malignancy in women over age  with a pelvic mass for whom surgery is planned 
ova was developed through large clinical studies in collaboration with numerous academic medical centers encompassing over  clinical samples 
ova was fully validated in a prospective multi center clinical trial encompassing sites reflective of the diverse nature of the clinical centers at which ovarian adnexal masses are evaluated 
the results of the clinical trial demonstrated that in a clinical cohort of patients  ova  in conjunction with clinical evaluation  was able to identify of the malignant ovarian tumors overall  and to rule out malignancy with a negative predictive value npv of 
at the international gynecologic cancer society meeting  data were presented demonstrating the high sensitivity of ova for epithelial ovarian cancers  ova detected epithelial ovarian cancer cases for a sensitivity of  including stage i and stage ii epithelial ovarian cancers  for an overall sensitivity of for early stage epithelial ovarian cancers  as compared to for ca using the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists acog cutoffs 
the improvement in sensitivity was even greater among premenopausal women  for ova  sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer was and for ca  sensitivity was 
overall  ova detected of malignancies missed by ca  including all advanced stage malignancies 
ova is not indicated for use as a screening or stand alone diagnostic assay 
in addition to ova  we have development programs in other clinical aspects of ovarian cancer as well as in peripheral arterial disease 
in the field of peripheral arterial disease  we have identified candidate biomarkers that may help to identify individuals at high risk for a decreased ankle brachial index score  which is indicative of the likely presence of peripheral arterial disease 
we have recently completed an intended use study to develop and validate a multi marker algorithm for the assessment of individuals at risk for peripheral arterial disease 
this algorithm will be specifically directed at a primary care population in which the peripheral arterial disease blood test vasclir is expected to be used 
once this study has been published in the peer reviewed literature  we intend to discuss with the fda the appropriate submission pathway  which may be premarket approval pma  k clearance  or k de novo clearance 
in another program  we have also initiated pilot experiments intended to identify markers with high clinical specificity that may complement ova these experiments are early stage and may take different directions depending on the results 
we have yet to establish a regulatory pathway for this potential product ova 
current and former academic and research institutions that we have or have had collaborations with include the johns hopkins university school of medicine jhu  the university of texas md anderson cancer center md anderson  university college london ucl  the university of texas medical branch

we have a strategic alliance agreement the strategic alliance agreement with quest diagnostics to develop and commercialize up to three diagnostic tests from our product pipeline the strategic alliance 
quest diagnostics has the exclusive right to commercialize ova until september  with an option to extend such exclusive period in its sole discretion for one additional year 
to date  quest diagnostics has selected two diagnostic tests to commercialize  vasclir and ova on april   we further amended the strategic alliance agreement with quest diagnostics and quest diagnostics india 
pursuant to amendment no 
 quest diagnostics india will have the exclusive right to commercialize ova in india for a certain period of time  as specified in the strategic alliance agreement  as amended 
the amendment also establishes amounts due to vermillion related to the performance of ova in india 
we were originally incorporated in california on december   under the name abiotic systems 
in march  we changed our corporate name to ciphergen biosystems  inc and in may  we reincorporated in delaware 
we had our initial public offering in september on november   we sold assets and liabilities of our protein research tools and collaborative services business the instrument business sale  to bio rad laboratories  inc bio rad  in order to concentrate our resources on developing clinical protein biomarker diagnostic products and services 
on august   we changed our corporate name to vermillion  inc on march   we filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of title of the united states code the bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court 
subsequently  on january   the confirmation order issued by the bankruptcy court approving our second amended plan of reorganization under chapter dated january  became final and all conditions precedent to january  were satisfied or waived 
accordingly  we emerged from bankruptcy protection under chapter on january  our bankruptcy case was formally closed on january  ova was launched on march  by quest diagnostics under the terms of the strategic alliance agreement 
on march   the medicare contractor highmark medicare services announced that it would cover ova in its reimbursement program 
on september   we announced that ova was ce marked  a requirement for marketing the test in the european union 
ova has satisfied all certification requirements to complete its declaration of conformity 
on august   we entered into an exclusive distribution agreement the pronto agreement with pronto diagnostics ltd 
pronto diagnostics 
pursuant to the pronto agreement  pronto diagnostics will have the exclusive right to distribute ova in israel and areas under palestinian control for a certain period of time as specified in the pronto agreement  provided that pronto diagnostics will sell certain minimum quantities of ova to maintain the exclusive distribution rights 
the pronto agreement also establishes the amounts that pronto diagnostics will pay to us with respect of ova this supports our goal of expanding ova into international markets 
on november   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with correlogic systems  inc correlogic  pursuant to which and subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  we agreed to pay to correlogic  and purchase from correlogic substantially all of its assets  including certain documents  diagnostic samples and intellectual property owned by correlogic in connection with correlogic s ovarian cancer diagnostics business  including a diagnostic test under the name ovacheck for the detection of ovarian cancer the acquisition 
correlogic was in chapter proceedings in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of maryland the court at the time the asset purchase agreement was entered into and the acquisition was subject to court approval 
on december   the court entered an order approving the acquisition and on december   we completed the acquisition 
we plan to use the correlogic assets purchased from the acquisition to advance the goals of our ovarian cancer franchise  including the development of ova 
table of contents the diagnostic market the economics of healthcare demand improved allocation of resources which can be derived through disease prevention  early detection of disease leading to early intervention  and diagnostic tools that can triage patients to more appropriate therapy and intervention 
according to the may in vitro diagnostics market analysis report  the worldwide market for in vitro diagnostics ivds in was approximately billion 
visiongain  an independent business information provider  predicts that the market will generate nearly billion in we have chosen to concentrate primarily in the areas of oncology  cardiology and women s health 
demographic trends suggest that  as the population ages  the burden from these diseases will increase and the demand for quality diagnostic  prognostic and predictive tests will increase 
in addition  these areas generally lack quality diagnostic tests and  therefore  we believe patient outcomes can be significantly improved by the development of novel diagnostic tests 
our focus on translational proteomics enables us to address the market for novel diagnostic tests that simultaneously measure multiple protein biomarkers 
a protein biomarker is a protein or protein variant that is present at greater or lesser concentrations in a disease state versus a normal condition 
conventional protein tests measure a single protein biomarker whereas most diseases are complex 
we believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level ie  most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies and at the human response level ie  each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner 
consequently  measuring a single protein biomarker when multiple protein biomarkers may be altered in a complex disease is unlikely to provide meaningful information about the disease state 
we believe that our approach of monitoring and combining multiple protein biomarkers using a variety of analytical techniques will allow us to create diagnostic tests with sufficient sensitivity and specificity about the disease state to aid the physician considering treatment options for patients with complex diseases 
ovarian cancer background 
commonly known as the silent killer  ovarian cancer leads to approximately  deaths each year in the united states 
approximately  new ovarian cancer cases are diagnosed each year  with the majority of the patients in the late stages of the disease in which the cancer has spread beyond the ovary 
unfortunately  ovarian cancer patients in the late stages of the disease have a poor prognosis  which leads to the high mortality rates 
according to the american cancer society  when ovarian cancer is diagnosed at its earliest stage  the patient has a year survival rate of 
ovarian cancer patients have up to a cure rate following surgery and or chemotherapy if detected in stage however  only of ovarian cancer patients are diagnosed before the tumor has spread outside the ovary 
for ovarian cancer patients diagnosed in the late stages of the disease  the year survival rate falls to as low as 
while the diagnosis of ovarian cancer in its earliest stages greatly increases the likelihood of survival from the disease  another factor that predicts survival from ovarian cancer is the specialized training of the surgeon who operates on the ovarian cancer patient 
numerous studies have demonstrated that treatment of malignant ovarian tumors by specialists such as gynecologic oncologists or at specialist medical centers improves outcomes for women with these tumors 
published guidelines from the society of gynecologic oncologists the sgo and the acog recommend referral of women with malignant ovarian tumors to specialists 
unfortunately  today  only about one third of women with these types of tumors are operated on by specialists  in part because of inadequate tests and procedures that can identify such malignancies with high sensitivity 
accordingly  an unmet clinical need is a diagnostic test that can provide adequate predictive value to stratify patients with a pelvic mass into those with a high risk of invasive ovarian cancer versus those with a low risk of ovarian cancer  which is essential for improving overall survival in patients with ovarian cancer 
although adnexal masses are relatively common  malignant tumors are less so 
screening studies have indicated that the prevalence of adnexal masses in postmenopausal women can be as high as percent 
adnexal 
table of contents masses are thought to be even more common in premenopausal women  but there are more non persistent  physiologic ovarian masses in this demographic 
in the prostate  lung  colorectal and ovarian cancer study american journal of obstetrics and gynecology    post menopausal women were screened for ovarian malignancy and received an abnormal ultrasound 
using the us census of million women over the age of  this suggests there are million adnexal masses in this segment alone 
although many of these do not present to the physician or are not concerning enough to warrant surgery  those that do require evaluation for the likelihood of malignancy could potentially benefit from the use of ova the acog and the sgo have issued guidelines to help physicians evaluate adnexal masses for malignancy 
these guidelines take into account menopausal status  ca levels  and physical and imaging findings 
however  these guidelines have notable shortcomings because of their reliance on tools with certain weaknesses 
most notably  the ca blood test  which is cleared by the fda only for monitoring for recurrence of ovarian cancer  is negative in up to of early stage ovarian cancer cases 
moreover  ca can be elevated in numerous conditions and diseases other than ovarian cancer  including benign ovarian masses and endometriosis 
these shortcomings limit the ca blood test s utility in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian tumors or for use in detection of early stage ovarian cancer 
transvaginal ultrasound is another diagnostic modality used with patients with ovarian masses 
attempts at defining specific morphological criteria that can aid in a benign versus malignant diagnosis have led to the morphology index and the risk of malignancy index  with reports of predictive value 
however  ultrasound interpretation can be variable and dependent on the experience of the operator 
accordingly  the acog and sgo guidelines perform only modestly in identifying early stage ovarian cancer and malignancy in pre menopausal women 
efforts to improve detection of cancer by lowering the cutoff for ca the modified acog sgo guidelines provide only a modest benefit  since ca is absent in about of epithelial ovarian cancer cases and is poorly detected in early stage ovarian cancer 
clinical development 
to address this documented unmet clinical need  we initiated an ovarian cancer biomarker discovery program 
in august  we  along with collaborators at jhu  ucl and md anderson  reported in a cancer research paper the discovery of three biomarkers that  when combined with ca  provided higher diagnostic accuracy for early stage ovarian cancer than other biomarkers  including ca alone 
the three biomarkers that we reported in the august cancer research paper formed the basis of an expanded panel of biomarkers that together have demonstrated risk stratification value in a series of studies involving over  clinical samples from more than five clinical sites 
data presented at the june annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology demonstrated the portability of this biomarker panel among different clinical groups  indicating its potential validity across various testing populations 
data presented at the march annual meeting of the sgo described results from a cohort study 
we were able to demonstrate in consecutively sampled women  a significant increase in the positive predictive value using its biomarker panel over the baseline level 
this translates into the potential to enrich the concentration of ovarian cancer cases referred to the gynecologic oncologist by more than twofold 
ova ovarian tumor triage test 
in january   we commenced our multi center prospective clinical trial to demonstrate the clinical performance and utility of ova  which was developed based on the studies described above 
the clinical study population came from institutions with primary care physicians  gynecologists non go  and or gynecologic oncologists go 
the clinical study subject enrollment centers were representative of institutions where ovarian tumor subjects potentially undergo a gynecologic examination 
the specimens were collected at demographically mixed sites that included large and small medical centers universities community hospitals  clinics that specialize in women s health  small gynecology obstetrics groups  gynecology oncology practices  and hmo groups 
the performance of ova was determined based on evaluable subjects who underwent surgery to remove a documented ovarian tumor and for whom a pathology result was available 
physicians were asked  based on the information they had  which included physical  radiologic  and laboratory results  whether they believed the patient had cancer clinical assessment 
physicians were not provided with ova score in making this determination 
after surgery  the specimen was examined by a surgical pathologist per routine clinical practice 
the ability of physicians to predict malignancy without ova was compared to the ability of physicians or ova dual assessment to predict 
table of contents malignancy 
with dual assessment  which included ova  of cancers missed by clinician impression alone were detected 
dual assessment  which included ova  had greater sensitivity and negative predictive value than clinical assessment alone and the metrics of clinical performance were and  respectively 
we obtained fda clearance of ova on september  ova is the first fda cleared test to be used in the pre surgical evaluation of ovarian adnexal masses 
results from the clinical trial were presented at the annual meeting of the sgo 
a presentation by rachel ware miller  md  associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the university of kentucky s markey cancer center  demonstrated that the acog sgo guidelines detected only of ovarian malignancies and that the modified acog sgo guidelines improved detection to only 
moreover  detection of early stage ovarian cancer was only 
a second presentation by fred ueland  md  associate professor of gynecologic oncology  demonstrated that among non gynecologic oncologists  ova  in conjunction with clinical impression  improved detection of malignancy to from using clinical impression alone among patients evaluated by non gynecologic oncologists 
among these patients  detection of stage i ovarian cancer was 
additional results from the clinical trial were presented at the international gynecologic cancer society igcs meeting 
this presentation reported that ova had overall sensitivity for ovarian cancer of  as compared to for ca using cutoffs established in the acog criteria for adnexal mass evaluation and for ca using cutoffs in the modified acog criteria 
additionally  data were presented demonstrating the high sensitivity of ova for epithelial ovarian cancers  ova detected epithelial ovarian cancer cases for a sensitivity of  including stage i and stage ii epithelial ovarian cancers  for an overall sensitivity of for early stage epithelial ovarian cancers  as compared to for ca using the acog cutoffs 
the improvement in sensitivity was even greater among premenopausal women  for ova  sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer was and for ca  sensitivity was 
overall  ova detected of malignancies missed by ca  including all advanced stage malignancies 
ova is not indicated for use as a screening or stand alone diagnostic assay 
health economic analysis indicates that anticipated benefits of ova include i more appropriate referrals of women with high risk of malignancy to a gynecologic oncologist and fewer referrals of women at low risk of malignancy  ii fewer second surgeries as a result of an initial surgery by a generalist on a woman with a malignant tumor  iii reduced need for a backup surgeon ie specialist during a surgery by a generalist  iv more appropriate and efficient administration of intraperitoneal chemotherapy  v longer survival  associated with better quality of life 
peripheral arterial disease peripheral arterial disease pad represents atherosclerosis of the lower extremities and is generally reflective of systemic atherosclerotic disease and is therefore a risk factor for adverse cardiac events such as myocardial infarction and stroke 
this disease affects between million americans  and the number of people diagnosed with pad is expected to increase concurrently with the rising number of people diagnosed with diabetes 
the american heart association and the american college of cardiology have identified three demographics at risk for pad smokers years of age or older  diabetics years of age or older  and the elderly years of age or older 
collectively  this represents tens of millions of americans 
pad is most commonly diagnosed using the ankle brachial index abi  which is performed using a handheld doppler 
blood pressures are measured in the arm and at the ankles and the ratio ankle arm is calculated 
non affected individuals should have a ratio of or greater  while individuals with a ratio of less than are defined as having pad 
although the abi has good sensitivity and specificity for pad  its implementation into routine clinical practice has been hampered by poor physician adoption  generally because of the need to utilize special equipment by a specially trained technician and the need to have the patient lie supine in an examination room for to minutes prior to the administration of this test 
additionally  studies 
table of contents have shown that the abi is often performed incorrectly 
therefore  a blood test that can be more routinely implemented would be beneficial in identifying people at increased risk for pad 
in collaboration with john p 
cooke  md  md  a professor and associate director of the stanford cardiovascular institute at stanford university school of medicine  we have performed both an initial discovery study and a first validation study that has resulted in the identification of blood markers that could assist in the diagnosis of pad 
these findings form the basis of a novel blood diagnostic test for pad 
the results of these studies  including the publication of two blood markers for pad  were published in the august on line issue of the peer reviewed journal circulation  which is published by the american heart association the aha 
independent validation of these initial findings was subsequently published in the peer reviewed journal vascular medicine in this study  which encompassed individuals  confirmed the elevation of the two biomarkers in subjects with pad 
moreover  the study showed that a panel of markers improved the identification of subjects with pad and was complementary to available data  including the aha risk score 
in this study  subjects with a moderate aha risk score but elevated pad biomarker score had almost a times increased likelihood of having pad than if they had a normal pad biomarker score 
commercialization we expect to commercialize and sell diagnostic tests which may consist of reagents and or proprietary software in one or both of two phases 
one phase  referred to as the laboratory developed test ldt phase  will involve the sale of certain reagents which may be in the form of proprietary software to certain customers coupled with the grant to such customer of a sublicense to utilize the reagent in a laboratory developed test using the methodology covered by the relevant license s obtained from our collaborators 
an ldt would comprise multiple reagents such as assay test kits  software  or other reagents  some of which would be supplied by us  and would be utilized by clinical laboratories to develop and perform home brew laboratory tests in laboratories federally regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of clia 
in the other phase  referred to as the ivd phase  we plan to sell fda cleared devices which may comprise multiple reagents such as assay test kits  software  or other reagents 
under the terms of the amended strategic alliance agreement  quest diagnostics has the right to commercialize up to three diagnostic tests from our product pipeline 
to date  quest diagnostics has selected two tests  vasclir and ova pursuant to the amended strategic alliance agreement  quest diagnostics will have the non exclusive right to commercialize each of the tests other than ova on a worldwide basis  with exclusive commercialization rights in each exclusive territory  as this term is defined in the amended strategic alliance agreement  beginning on the date each test is first commercialized and ending on the third anniversary of the date that such test is cleared or approved by the fda 
quest has exclusive commercialization rights to commercialize ova in each exclusive territory through september and the right to extend the exclusivity period for one additional year 
these exclusive territories consist of the united states  india  mexico  and the united kingdom 
quest diagnostics has the non exclusive right to commercialize ova on a worldwide basis outside of these exclusive territories 
customers in the united states  the ivd market can be segmented into three major groups clinical reference laboratories  the largest of which are quest diagnostics and laboratory corporation of america  hospital laboratories  and physician offices 
initially  substantially all of our revenue in the united states will be generated through clinical reference laboratories  and quest diagnostics will be the major customer 
we will attempt to penetrate hospital laboratories and physician offices  when appropriate 
outside the united states  laboratories may become customers  either directly with us or via distribution relationships established between us and authorized distributors 

table of contents research and development our research and development efforts center on the discovery and validation of biomarkers and combinations of biomarkers that can be developed into diagnostic assays 
we do this predominantly through collaborations we have established with academic institutions such as jhu  rigshospitalet  and stanford as well as through contract research organizations cro s such as precisionmed and the colorado prevention center 
scientific background genes are the hereditary coding system of living organisms 
genes encode proteins that are responsible for cellular functions 
the study of genes and their functions has led to the discovery of new targets for drug development 
industry sources estimate that  within the human genome  there are approximately  genes 
although the primary structure of a protein is determined by a gene  the active structure of a protein is frequently altered by interactions with additional genes or proteins 
these subsequent modifications result in hundreds of thousands of different proteins 
in addition  proteins may interact with one another to form complex structures that are ultimately responsible for cellular functions 
genomics allows researchers to establish the relationship between gene activity and disease 
however  many diseases are manifested not at the genetic level  but at the protein level 
the complete structure of modified proteins cannot be determined by reference to the encoding gene alone 
thus  while genomics provides some information about diseases  it does not provide a full understanding of disease processes 
we are focused on converting recent advances in proteomics into clinically useful diagnostic tests 
relationship between proteins and diseases the entire genetic content of any organism  known as its genome  is encoded in strands of deoxyribonucleic acid dna 
cells perform their normal biological functions through the genetic instructions encoded in their dna  which results in the production of proteins 
the process of producing proteins from dna is known as gene expression or protein expression 
differences in living organisms result from variability in their genomes  which can affect the types of genes expressed and the levels of gene expression 
each cell of an organism expresses only approximately to of the genome 
the type of cell determines which genes are expressed and the amount of a particular protein produced 
for example  liver cells produce different proteins from those produced by cells found in the heart  lungs  skin  etc 
proteins play a crucial role in virtually all biological processes  including transportation and storage of energy  immune protection  generation and transmission of nerve impulses and control of growth 
diseases may be caused by a mutation of a gene that alters a protein directly or indirectly  or alters the level of protein expression 
these alterations interrupt the normal balance of proteins and create disease symptoms 
a protein biomarker is a protein or protein variant that is present in a greater or lesser amount in a disease state versus a normal condition 
by studying changes in protein biomarkers  researchers may identify diseases prior to the appearance of physical symptoms 
historically  researchers discovered protein biomarkers as a byproduct of basic biological disease research  which resulted in the validation by researchers of approximately protein biomarkers that are being used in commercially available clinical diagnostic products 
limitations of existing diagnostic approaches the ivd industry manufactures and distributes products that are used to detect thousands of individual components present in human derived specimens 
however  the vast majority of these assays are used specifically to identify single protein biomarkers 
the development of new diagnostic products has been limited by the complexity of disease states  which may be caused or characterized by several or many proteins or post translationally modified protein variants 
diagnostic assays that are limited to the detection of a single protein often have limitations in clinical specificity true negatives and sensitivity true positives due to the complex nature of many diseases and the inherent biological diversity among populations of people 
diagnostic products that are limited to the detection of a single protein may lack the ability to detect more complex diseases  and thus produce results that are unacceptable for practical use 
the heterogeneity of disease and of the human response to disease often underlies the shortcoming of single biomarkers to diagnose and predict many diseases accurately 

table of contents our solution our studies  particularly in ovarian cancer  have given us a better understanding of both the disease pathophysiology and the host response 
by using multiple biomarkers  we are able to better characterize the disease and host response heterogeneity 
in addition  by examining specific biomarkers with greater resolution  for example  post translational modifications  we believe we can improve the specificity of our diagnostic biomarkers because these modifications reflect both the pathophysiology and host response 
this is accomplished using novel protein analysis tools coupled with multivariate statistical analysis software to identify combinations of specific biomarkers leading to commercialization of disease specific assays 
we are applying translational proteomics research  development tools  and methods to analyze biological information in an attempt to discover associations between proteins  protein variants  protein protein interaction and diseases 
we intend to develop new diagnostic tests based on known and newly identified protein markers to help physicians predict an individual s predisposition for a disease in order to better characterize  monitor progression of and select appropriate therapies for such disease 
our goal is to develop novel diagnostic tests that address unmet medical needs  particularly in stratifying patients according to the risk of developing a disease  having a disease or failing a specific therapy for a disease 
addressing the heterogeneity of disease our strategy is to create a diagnostics paradigm that is based on risk stratification  multiple biomarker testing and information integration 
this strategy is based on the belief that any specific disease is heterogeneous and  therefore  relying on a single disease biomarker to provide a simple yes no answer is likely to fail 
we believe that efforts to diagnose cancer and other complex diseases have failed in large part because the disease is heterogeneous at the causative level  meaning that most diseases can be traced to multiple potential etiologies  and at the human response level  meaning that each individual afflicted with a given disease can respond to that ailment in a specific manner 
consequently  diagnosis  disease monitoring and treatment decisions can be challenging 
this heterogeneity of disease and difference in human response to disease and or treatment underlies the shortcomings of single biomarkers to predict and identify many diseases 
a better understanding of heterogeneity of disease and human response is necessary for improved diagnosis and treatment of many diseases 
validation of biomarkers through proper study design analysis of peer reviewed publications reveals almost daily reports of novel biomarkers or biomarker combinations associated with specific diseases 
few of these are used clinically 
as with drug discovery  preliminary research results fail to canvass sufficient variation in study populations or laboratory practices and  therefore  the vast majority of candidate biomarkers fail to be substantiated in subsequent studies 
recognizing that validation is the point at which most biomarkers fail  our strategy is to reduce the attrition rate between discovery and clinical implementation by building validation into the discovery process 
biomarkers fail to validate for a number of reasons  which can be broadly classified into pre analytical and analytical factors 
pre analytical factors include study design that does not mimic actual clinical practice  inclusion of the wrong types of control individuals and demographic bias usually seen in studies in which samples are collected from a single institution 
analytical factors include poor control over laboratory protocols  inadequate randomization of study samples and instrumentation biases for example  higher signal early in the experimental run compared to later in the experimental run 
finally  the manner in which the data are analyzed can have a profound impact on the reliability of the statistical conclusions 
when designing clinical studies  we begin with the clinical question  since this drives the downstream clinical utility of the biomarkers 
with the starting point of building validation into the discovery process  we design our studies to include the appropriate cases and control groups 
we further incorporate an initial validation component even within the discovery component 
we place an emphasis on multi institutional studies  
table of contents inclusion of clinically relevant controls  using qualified and trained operators to run assays and collect data 
for example  in an august cancer research paper  which describes the first three biomarkers in the ovarian cancer panel  there were more than specimen samples taken from five hospitals that were analyzed 
in the development of ova  we analyzed more than  samples from five additional medical centers prior to initiating the prospective ovarian clinical study for submission to the fda 
additionally to date  we have examined over samples in our pad program 
in analyzing the complex proteomics data  we take a skeptical view of statistical methodologies  choosing to use a variety of approaches and looking for concordance between approaches  taking the view that biomarkers deemed significant by multiple statistical algorithms are more likely to reflect biological conditions than mathematical artifacts 
through biomarker discovery efforts conducted predominantly from through  we have amassed a portfolio of candidate biomarkers identified in retrospective sample sets 
our research and development efforts are now mostly focused on validating these biomarkers in prospective studies 
during the period from through  we conducted a multi center prospective clinical trial to determine the clinical performance of ova  which was submitted to the fda on june   and cleared by the fda on september  we have additional markers for ovarian cancer that we plan to evaluate and validate 
additionally  we recently completed a prospective intended use study for pad 
these activities are outlined below 
r d sponsored initiatives to support market development to support ova we have two ongoing r d sponsored initiatives to support ova market development and adoption as an improved standard of care in the pre surgical triage and evaluation of adnexal masses 
the first is a major new clinical study of ova  focused on its performance in the predominantly pre menopausal non gynecologic oncologist patient population 
this will follow up on and extend the landmark studies of ueland and miller with a completely new patient cohort  in an independent  multi center patient population 
we expect this study to be submitted later in for publication 
the second is a series of vermillion assisted  independent clinical research studies of ova through this new program  vermillion offers limited support for well qualified principal investigators in the form of materials  testing services  and scientific consulting 
as a result  we are currently in discussion with a number of potential investigators  to support new research publications on ova s clinical utility  cost effectiveness  and potential line extensions 
new ovarian cancer indications 
while our focus on supporting the commercialization of ova is our primary priority  we also may extend our ovarian cancer franchise beyond ova  enabled by three key initiatives 
first  we have a research and license agreement with jhu to evaluate markers that provide improved specificity in the detection of ovarian cancer 
candidate markers are currently being assessed in small  pilot sample sets 
markers demonstrating high specificity may then be assessed in larger  clinical samples sets 
pilot results of these studies were reported in early at the society of gynecologic oncologists 
second  our research and license agreement with rigshospitalet copenhagen generated data showing that a certain combination of markers can separate ovarian cancer patients into those with good prognosis from those with poor prognosis 
these results were published in and we filed a patent application 
third  the acquisition of correlogic assets in brings with it highly curated clinical samples  intellectual property and promising biomarker leads 
these have the potential to further amplify our ova efforts in the future 
prospective intended use clinical study for peripheral arterial disease pad 
in  we completed an intended use study to validate a multi marker algorithm for the assessment of individuals at risk for pad 
this algorithm will be specifically directed at a primary care population in which vasclir is expected to be used 
the intended use study was a prospective  double blinded multi center study of approximately  subjects who met specific inclusion criteria for being at increased risk of having pad  including smokers and diabetics age or above and elderly age or above 
on october   we announced positive top line 
table of contents results from the intended use study of vasclir 
the goals of the study were to validate the markers described in earlier publications circulation  and vascular medicine  and to develop and validate a biomarker panel applicable to the intended use population 
key results of the study include the following the individual biomarkers beta microglobulin bm  cystatin c  and hscrp high sensitivity c reactive protein  each had statistically significant different levels between pad subjects and non pad subjects p 
as in the previous study described in the earlier publications  these biomarkers showed statistically significant correlation to the ankle brachial index or abi  p 
a logistic regression model was able to identify more than of pad patients among those deemed low risk by the conventional framingham risk score for estimating cardiovascular disease probability 
the work has been submitted for presentation at a recognized national vascular medicine conference  and is awaiting a decision 
a manuscript will also be submitted to a leading vascular medicine journal in the first half of this presentation and manuscript will support our future discussions with the fda regarding the appropriate submission pathway  which may be pma  k clearance  or k de novo clearance 
quest diagnostics has accepted the pad test as a development program under the terms of the amended strategic alliance agreement 
our research and development expenses were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
commercial operations we have a commercial infrastructure  including sales and marketing and reimbursement expertise 
our sales representatives work with colleagues at quest diagnostics to identify opportunities for communicating the benefits of ova to general gynecologists and gynecologic oncologists alike 
our success will also depend on our ability to penetrate markets outside of the united states 
ova is ce marked  a requirement for marketing the test in the european union 
ova has satisfied all certification requirements to complete its declaration of conformity 
at the end of  approximately  ova tests had been performed in the calendar year  an increase of over additionally  over gynecologic oncologists are supportive or advocating the use of ova for the triage of women with adnexal masses 
this broad number of specialists supporting the test indicates an understanding of the unmet clinical need and the ability of ova to serve a significant market to assist physicians to triage women who need a specialist for surgery from those who can be treated by the primary physician 
as of december   doctors had ordered ova  an increase of over december this indicates a market penetration of of the available gynecologists in the us 
we continue to develop the market through experienced territory development managers and have expanded their scope of responsibility 
as market awareness continues to build  these managers are focused on efforts that will have a positive impact on regional payers and create positive coverage decisions 
they are working with local key opinion leaders and meeting with medical directors to discuss the unmet clinical need  our technology assessment package and increasing experience and cases studies showing the positive outcomes utilizing ova there are still obstacles to overcome and significant milestones to attain to ensure ongoing success 
first  although the test volume and the number of doctors continue to increase  the average gynecologist will only see about to appropriate patients per month and additional effort will be required to establish a consistent 
table of contents ordering pattern 
second  insurance coverage and patient bills are a concern to the physician and can disrupt the ordering pattern of a generalist who is supportive of ova these obstacles are being addressed in a cross functional approach to include publishing additional clinical studies  working towards ova inclusion in professional guidelines in a reasonable time frame  adding positive coverage decisions on a regional and national basis  and improving coding and claims through obtaining a category i cpt code 
in january  we announced a restructuring plan to streamline our organization and reduce our cash expenditures compared to this plan included eliminating the positions of chief financial officer and vice president of corporate strategy as well as a reduction in our territory development and sales management personnel 
we intend to reduce cash based operating expenses in  extending our cash runway while focusing our efforts on the continued commercialization of ova and advancing our product pipeline 
reimbursement in the united states  revenue for diagnostic tests comes from several sources  including third party payers such as insurance companies and government healthcare programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
on march   we announced that highmark medicare services  the medicare contractor that has jurisdiction over claims submitted by quest diagnostics for ova  will cover ova this local coverage determination from highmark medicare services essentially provides national coverage for patients enrolled in medicare as well as medicare advantage health plans 
we have worked together with quest diagnostics to obtain coverage and reimbursement from private payers across the country 
as of january   twenty five independent bluecross blueshield plans  representing more than million lives  provide coverage for ova in total  including medicare and other private payers  approximately million patients have access and coverage for ova the company and quest diagnostics are pursuing coverage from additional payers 
on march   the american medical association ama current procedural terminology cpt panel voted to approve an application for a category i cpt code for ova the ama recently disclosed the new code on its website  which will become effective january  the new cpt code is a positive step forward in advancing the commercialization of ova  as we believe it will help streamline claims processing and accelerate further coverage and adoption by private payers 
new and innovative diagnostic tests often face reimbursement challenges that can affect adoption  the three key focus areas are coding  claims  and coverage or payor adoption 
in conjunction with quest diagnostics  we are consistently addressing these three areas 
coding ova is a new class of diagnostics and therefore no specific code existed upon our launch 
this is often the case with new diagnostic tests and companies will bill using a miscellaneous code  which is the path we and quest diagnostics have implemented 
now  after establishing ova in the market  creating demand  demonstrating the utility of the test  obtaining coverage and reimbursement  we took the additional step of filing for a cpt code specific for ova in achieving a unique category i code is a critical step in a company s commercialization process 
now that our cpt code has been approved  the process will continue forward to establish the appropriate reimbursement rate for the unique code 
claims process in the early launch of a product that does not have its own cpt code  claims can be rejected due to lack of medical necessity  lack of payer understanding  or even billing process errors 
to address these items  our territory development managers are engaging with physicians offices to assist in the appeals process and are using these claims to educate payers and create awareness about the medical necessity of our test 

table of contents payer coverage we continue to focus on going efforts toward obtaining national coverage decisions 
however  these typically have a much longer lead time due to industry established processes and time frames 
in most cases  these entail clinical and technical reviews that are performed on an annual basis 
we have assembled a technology assessment package that will provide a nucleus of materials tailored to each national plan 
we have launched a program to aid local key opinion leaders to work with health plans to support coverage for ova these strategic actions are necessary steps to convert those plans representing numerous regional payers and late adopters 
competition the diagnostics industry in which we operate is competitive and evolving 
there is intense competition among healthcare  biotechnology and diagnostics companies attempting to discover candidates for potential new diagnostic products 
these companies may develop new diagnostic products in advance of us or our collaborators  develop diagnostic products that are more effective or cost effective than those developed by us or our collaborators  obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their diagnostic products more rapidly than us or our collaborators  or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that would limit the ability to develop and commercialize  or a customers ability to use our or our collaborators diagnostic products 
we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and commercialization of novel biomarkers that may form the basis of novel diagnostic tests 
these companies may develop products that are competitive with and or perform the same or similar to the products offered by us or our collaborators  such as biomarker specific reagents or diagnostic test kits 
also  clinical laboratories may offer testing services that are competitive with the products sold by us or our collaborators 
for example  a clinical laboratory can either use reagents purchased from manufacturers other than us or use its own internally developed reagents to make diagnostic tests 
if clinical laboratories make tests in this manner for a particular disease  they could offer testing services for that disease as an alternative to products sold by us used to test for the same disease 
the testing services offered by clinical laboratories may be easier to develop and market than test kits developed by us or our collaborators because the testing services are not subject to the same clinical validation requirements that are applicable to fda cleared or approved diagnostic test kits 
in september  fujirebio diagnostics received fda clearance for risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm 
this test is made up of two tumor markers he and caii and includes a publicly available algorithm which takes into consideration menopausal status 
the intended use is the same as ova in january  the test was made available by laboratory corporation of america 
the two tests have not been compared in a side by side cohort evaluation to date  so no direct performance comparisons can be made 
however  studies have shown ova offers significant performance in the following key areas sensitivity across a broad range of ovarian cancer subtypes  sensitivity for early stage epithelial ovarian cancer  npv adds reassurance that an ovarian mass with a negative ova score is benign  and a 
table of contents comprehensive biomarker panel that detects tumor secreted proteins while also measuring the host response to ovarian cancer the market has indicated that these factors are critical to the proper triage of women with ovarian masses

manufacturing we are the manufacturer of ova components of ova include reagents for each of the component assays as well as the ovacalc software 
because we do not directly manufacture the component assays  we are 
table of contents required to maintain supply agreements with manufacturers of each of the assays 
as part of our quality systems  reagent lots for these assays are tested to ensure they meet specifications required for inclusion in ova only reagent lots determined by us as having met these specifications are permitted for use in ova environmental matters medical waste we have been subject to licensing and regulation under federal  state and local laws relating to the handling and disposal of medical specimens and hazardous waste as well as to the safety and health of laboratory employees 
we formerly operated laboratories located in each of our former facilities in fremont  california  the last lease for which expired on august  our laboratories were operated in material compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to disposal of all laboratory specimens 
we utilized outside vendors for disposal of specimens 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
in addition  claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use  or the use by third parties  of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations is expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 
occupational safety in addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace  the federal occupational safety and health administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood borne pathogens such as hiv and the hepatitis virus 
these regulations  among other things  require work practice controls  protective clothing and equipment  training  medical follow up  vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to chemicals and transmission of the blood borne and airborne pathogens 
although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such federal  state and local laws  failure to comply could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business  fines  criminal penalties and other enforcement actions 
specimen transportation regulations of the department of transportation  the international air transportation agency  the public health service and the postal service apply to the surface and air transportation of clinical laboratory specimens 
government regulation general 
our activities related to diagnostic products are  or have the potential to be  subject to regulatory oversight by the fda under provisions of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and regulations thereunder  including regulations governing the development  marketing  labeling  promotion  manufacturing and export of our products 
the food  drug and cosmetic act requires that medical devices introduced to the united states market  unless exempted by regulation  be the subject of either a pre market notification clearance  known as a k clearance or k de novo clearance  or a pma 
ova was cleared by the fda on september  under the k de novo guidelines 
ova was the first fda cleared blood test for the pre operative assessment of ovarian masses 
we have not yet established a regulatory pathway for our future potential products such as vasclir and ova clinical studies to support either a k submission or a pma application would need to be conducted in accordance with fda requirements 
if the fda indicates that a pma is required for any of our potential future clinical products  the application will require extensive clinical studies  manufacturing information and likely review by a panel of experts outside the fda 
additionally  the fda will generally conduct a pre approval inspection for pma devices 

table of contents even in the case of devices like analyte specific reagents asrs  which may be exempt from k clearance or pma approval requirements  the fda may impose restrictions on marketing 
our potential future asr products may be sold only to clinical laboratories certified under the clia to perform high complexity testing 
in addition to requiring approval or clearance for new products  the fda may require approval or clearance prior to marketing products that are modifications of existing products or the intended uses of these products 
additionally  the fda will generally conduct a pre approval inspection for pma devices 
our suppliers manufacturing facilities are  and  if and when we begin commercializing and manufacturing our products ourselves  our manufacturing facilities will be  subject to periodic and unannounced inspections by the fda and state agencies for compliance with quality system regulations qsrs 
additionally  the fda will generally conduct a pre approval inspection for pma devices 
although we believe that we and our suppliers will be able to operate in compliance with the fda s qsrs for asrs  we cannot assure that we or our suppliers will be in or be able to maintain compliance in the future 
we have never been subject to an fda inspection and cannot assure that we will pass an inspection  if and when it occurs 
if the fda believes that we or our suppliers are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations  the fda can issue a form list of observations  warning letter  detain or seize our products  issue a recall notice  enjoin future violations and assess civil and criminal penalties against us 
in addition  approvals or clearances could be withdrawn under certain circumstances 
any customers using our products for clinical use in the united states may be regulated under clia  which is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the united states by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications  administration  participation in proficiency testing  patient test management  quality control  quality assurance and inspections 
the regulations promulgated under clia establish three levels of diagnostic tests namely  waived  moderately complex and highly complex and the standards applicable to a clinical laboratory depend on the level of the tests it performs 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many of the countries in which we may do business outside the united states 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our potential future medical device products  to requests for product data or certifications 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
in addition  products which have not yet been cleared or approved for domestic commercial distribution may be subject to the fda export reform and enhancement act of fdera 
fda regulation of cleared tests 
once granted  a k clearance or pma approval may place substantial restrictions on how our device is marketed or to whom it may be sold 
all devices cleared by the fda are subject to continuing regulation by the fda and certain state agencies 
as a medical device manufacturer  we are also required to register and list our products with the fda 
we are required to set forth and adhere to a quality policy and other regulations 
in addition  we are required to comply with the fda s qsrs  which require that our devices be manufactured and records be maintained in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing  testing and control activities 
additionally  we may be subject to inspection by federal and state regulatory agencies 
non compliance with these standards can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls  total or partial suspension of production 
further  we are required to comply with fda requirements for labeling and promotion 
for example  the fda prohibits cleared or approved devices from being promoted for uncleared or unapproved uses 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda  which prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses 
additionally  the fda is requiring us to perform a post marketing study post market surveillance to verify the performance characteristics of ova in routine clinical use 
in addition  the medical device reporting regulation requires that we provide information to the fda whenever evidence reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or where a malfunction has occurred that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
foreign government regulation of our products 
we intend to obtain regulatory approval in other countries to market our tests 
each country maintains its own regulatory review process  tariff regulations  duties 
table of contents and tax requirements  product standards  and labeling requirements 
in  we retained the services of the emergo group and tuv sud america inc to assist in our efforts to satisfy the regulatory requirements necessary for commercialization in europe
