overview our goal is to be a leader in connected media platforms for use in home entertainment and control 
we focus on integrated chipset solutions that serve as the foundation for some of the world s leading internet protocol television  or iptv  set top boxes  connected media players  residential gateways and home control systems 
we have four chipset product lines media processor products  home networking products  video image processor and encoder products and home control and energy management automation products 
we sell our products into four primary markets iptv media processor  connected home  connected media player  and the prosumer and industrial audio video markets 
we also sell a small amount of our chipsets into other markets  such as the digital signage  high definition television  or hdtv  projection tv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
we believe our software suite is a key differentiator within each of our target markets 
our software suite provides a foundation for our customers to develop their products that incorporate our chipsets 
our chipset products and target markets we consider all of our semiconductor products to be chipsets because each of our products are comprised of multiple semiconductors 
we believe our chipsets enable our customers to efficiently bring consumer multimedia devices to market 
we design our highly integrated products to significantly improve performance  lower power consumption and reduce cost 
we sell our chipsets into each of our four primary target markets 
for fiscal  and  we derived nearly all of our net revenue from sales of our chipset products 
our four primary target markets are the iptv media processor market  the connected home market  the connected media player market and the prosumer and industrial audio video market 
because of our focus on these target markets  we separately report revenues that we derive from sales into each of these target markets 
the iptv media processor market consists primarily of telecommunication carriers that deploy iptv set top boxes for delivering video services over a dsl network 
we serve this market primarily with our media processor products 
the connected home market consists of communication devices that use a standard protocol to connect equipment inside the home and stream ip based video and audio  voip  or data through wired or wireless connectivity 
we target the connected home market with our wired home networking products and our wireless home control and energy management automation products 
the connected media player market consists primarily of digital media adapters  or dmas  portable media devices  and wireless streaming pc to tv devices that perform playback of digital media 
we target this market with our media processor products 
the prosumer and industrial audio video market consists of studio quality audio video receivers and monitors  video conferencing  digital projectors and medical video monitors 
we target this market with our video image processor and video encoder product line 
we also sell products into other markets  such as the digital signage  high definition television  or hdtv  projection tv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
we derive minor revenue from sales of our products into these other markets 
characteristics of our business we do not enter into long term commitment contracts with our customers and generate substantially all of our net revenue based on customer purchase orders 
we forecast demand for our products based not only on our assessment of the requirements of our direct customers  but also on the anticipated requirements of the telecommunications carriers that our direct customers serve 
we work with both our direct customers and these carriers to address the market demands and the necessary specifications for our technologies 
however  our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers or lead to excess inventory  which could negatively impact our gross margins in a particular period 
during the year ending january   we recorded provisions for excess inventory of million primarily due to a large end customer s transition to a next generation product sold by one of our competitors 
many of our target markets are characterized by intense price competition 
the semiconductor industry is highly competitive and  as a result  we expect our average selling prices to decline over time 
on occasion  we have reduced our prices for individual customer volume orders as part of our strategy to obtain a competitive position in our target markets 
the willingness of customers to design our chipsets into their products depends to a significant extent upon our ability to sell our products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset any declines in product selling prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher gross margins in a timely manner  we could see declines in our market share or gross margins 
we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in our average selling prices and average costs  volume order discounts  mix of product sales  amount of development revenue and provisions for inventory excess and obsolescence 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make judgments that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of the assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and also revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the critical accounting policies as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended january   reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue primarily from sales of our products  which we refer to as chipsets  which consist of highly integrated semiconductors and embedded software that enables real time processing of digital video and audio content 
we do not deliver software as a separate product in connection with product sales 
we recognize revenue for product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
we evaluate our inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and estimated future unit sales by product as well as product purchase commitments that are not cancelable 
we develop our demand forecasts based  in part  on discussions with our customers about their forecasted supply needs 
however  our customers usually only provide us with firm purchase commitments for the current period and not our entire forecasted period 
additionally  our sales and marketing personnel provide estimates of future sales to prospective customers based on actual and expected design wins 
a provision is recorded for inventories in excess of estimated future demand 
in addition  we write off inventories that are obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are charged to cost of revenue 
at the time of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
if this lower cost inventory is subsequently sold  we will realize higher gross margins for those products 
inventory write downs inherently involve assumptions and judgments as to amount of future sales and selling prices 
during the year ended january   we recorded a million provision for excess inventory 
although we believe that the assumptions we use in estimating inventory write downs are reasonable  significant future changes in these assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
there can be no assurances that future events and changing market conditions will not result in significant inventory write downs 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development  or ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include customer relationships  developed technology  ipr d and trademarks 
we base our valuation of identifiable intangible assets on methods known as the income approach and the cost approach 
the income approach attempts to value an asset by estimating the present value of the future economic benefits it is expected to produce 
these benefits can include earnings  cost savings  tax deductions and disposition proceeds from the asset 
an indication of value may be developed in this approach by discounting expected cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation over the asset s holding period  and the risks associated with realizing the cash flows in the amounts and at the times projected 
the discount rate selected is typically based on rates of return available from alternative investments of similar type and quality as of the valuation date 
the most commonly employed income approach to valuation is the discounted cash flow analysis 
the market approach attempts to value an asset by examining observable market values for similar assets 
sales and offering prices for comparable assets are adjusted to reflect differences between the asset being valued and the comparable assets  such as  location  time and terms of sale  utility and physical characteristics 
when applied to the valuation of equity  the analysis may include consideration of the financial condition and operating performance of the company being valued relative to those of publicly traded companies or to those of companies acquired in a single transaction  which operate in the same or similar lines of business 
critical estimates and assumptions used in valuing these assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired products  customer relationships and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products  calculation of the weighted average cost of capital and expected cash flows from completed projects  assumptions regarding brand awareness and market position  and assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and assumptions about discount rates 
the estimated fair values are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to finite lived intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization 
we review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  as of the last day of our fiscal year  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
this review involves a two step process 
the first step requires identifying the reporting units and comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have identified that we operate one reporting unit and the fair value of our operating unit is determined to be equal to our market capitalization as determined through quoted market prices  adjusted for a reasonable control premium 
we estimate the control premium based on a review of acquisitions of comparable semiconductor companies that were completed during the last four years 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of our reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and  if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  impairment exists and is recorded 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a change in technology  indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than its carrying amount 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we concluded that an interim review of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets should be performed due to continued reductions in our profitability  sales forecasts and market capitalization 
in performing this review  we used both the income and the market valuation methodologies 
in applying the income approach  we developed a forecast of the discounted cash flows expected to be generated by our operating unit and in applying the market approach  we utilized the current value of our publically traded common stock adjusted for a control premium 
the result of this review showed that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its net book value and therefore indicated a possible impairment 
therefore  we performed the second step of the analysis by allocating the fair value of our reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities on a fair value basis to determine the amount of the impairment 
this analysis resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of million and an impairment charge for our indefinite lived in process research and development intangible assets of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed a review of the recoverability of our acquired intangible assets due to continued reductions in our profitability and sales forecasts  and negative cash flows from operations 
in performing this review  we developed a forecast of the total undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by each acquired intangible asset group and compared the result to the carrying value 
the results of this review indicated that two of these intangible asset groups  consisting primarily of certain developed technology and customer relationship intangibles related to our coppergate acquisition  were not fully recoverable 
therefore  we performed the second step of the analysis by developing a discounted cash flow analysis for each of the individual identifiable assets in these two groups to determine the amount of impairment 
our analysis resulted in an intangible asset impairment charge of million for fiscal determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include forecasts of revenue and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and a determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable at that time  however  actual future results may differ from those estimates 
future competitive  market and economic conditions could negatively impact key assumptions including our market capitalization  actual control premiums or the carrying value of our net assets  which could require us to realize an additional impairment of our intangible assets 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under an asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of any temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts reported for income tax purposes  and any operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for future taxable amounts and deferred tax assets are recognized for future deductions  net of any valuation allowance  to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are considered more likely than not to be realized 
the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized as the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
software  equipment and leasehold improvements software  equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
software includes intellectual property that we purchase for incorporation into our product designs 
we begin amortizing such intellectual property at the time that we begin shipment of the associated products into which it is incorporated 
we amortize the intellectual property over the estimated useful life of the associated products  which is generally two to three years 
depreciation and amortization for other software  equipment and leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the assets one to five years or the remaining lease term if shorter 
any allowance for leasehold improvements received from the landlord for improvements to our facilities is amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the useful life of the leasehold improvements 
repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant utilizing an option pricing model  which is impacted by our common stock price as well as a change in assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected common stock price volatility over the term of the option awards  as well as the projected employee option exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise date 
option pricing models have been developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value 
in our opinion  the existing black scholes option pricing model may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined using an option pricing model  the determined fair value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
valuation of marketable securities our marketable securities primarily include certificates of deposit  corporate commercial paper  corporate bonds  money market funds and us agency discount notes 
short term marketable securities represent highly liquid instruments with a remaining maturity date at acquisition date of greater than days but less than one year and are stated at fair value 
long term marketable securities represent securities with contractual maturities greater than one year from the date of acquisition 
our marketable securities are classified as available for sale because the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity 
the difference between amortized cost cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts  which is recognized as an adjustment to interest income and fair value  representing unrealized holding gains or losses  are recorded separately as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
any gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification basis 
we monitor all of our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have a decline in fair value  use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and future prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
accounts receivable we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot estimate whether collectability is reasonably assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we also provide allowances for bad debt and sales returns 
in establishing our allowance for bad debt  we review the customer s payment history and information regarding their credit worthiness 
in establishing our allowance for sales returns  we make estimates of potential future returns of products for which revenue has been recognized in the current period  including analyzing historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
in fiscal  and we recorded provisions for sales returns  discounts and bad debt in the total amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or future product returns increased  additional allowances may be required 
results of operations the following table is derived from our consolidated statements of operations and sets forth our historical operating results as a percentage of net revenue for each of the fiscal years indicated in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of net revenue january  of net revenue january  of net revenue net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative impairment of goodwill impairment of intangible assets total operating expenses income loss from operations interest and other income  net impairment of investment income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss net revenue our net revenue for fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in units shipped and a decline in average selling price per chipset  or asp 
the decrease in units shipped was comprised primarily of a decline for our media processor products and a decline for our home networking products 
the decrease in asps was primarily due to the increase  as a percentage of net revenue  of sales of our home networking and home control and energy management automation products and newer generation media processor products compared to sales of our older generation media processor products because asps for our home connectivity home automation and control products and newer generation media processor products are lower than our older generation media processor products 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors  the timing of new product introductions at telecommunications service providers and other consumer electronics companies and inventory levels at contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products 
we expect our revenue to fluctuate in future periods based on each of these factors 
our net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  compared to fiscal this increase in revenue for fiscal was primarily due to a increase in units shipped partially offset by a decrease in asps 
the increase in units shipped for fiscal was primarily the result of shipments of our home networking products  the majority of which we added to our product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increased shipments of our prosumer and industrial audio video products  or vxp  due to increased orders from our existing customers in the vxp market 
the decline in asp for fiscal was primarily the result of shipments of our home networking products which have lower asps than our media processor and vxp products 
net revenue by target market we sell our products into four primary target markets  which are the iptv media processor market  connected home market  connected media player market and prosumer and industrial audio video market 
we also sell a small amount of our chipsets into other markets  such as the digital signage  high definition television  or hdtv  projection tv and pc based add in markets  which we refer to as our other market 
the following table sets forth our net revenue by target market and the percentage of net revenue represented by our product sales to each target market in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of net revenue january  of net revenue january  of net revenue connected home iptv media processor connected media player prosumer and industrial audio video other net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
connected home market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected home market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal as a result of decreases of in asp and in units shipped 
the decrease in asp was primarily the result of transitions to our newer generation lower asp products and also certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our older generation products 
the decrease in units shipped was the result of a decrease in demand from contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products for deployment by telecommunications providers due to their management of their inventory levels 
our revenue from the connected home market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the overall decrease in units shipped into the iptv media processor market relative to shipments into the connected home market 
we expect our revenue from the connected home market to fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of our and our customer s new product introductions and adoption of our products that are based on both new and existing technologies such as hpav  g 
hn and z wave 
additionally  our revenues will also fluctuate due to competitive factors and changes in inventory levels at contract manufacturers who manufacture equipment incorporating our products for deployment by telecommunication providers 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected home market increased million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of our acquisition of coppergate in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the same reason  our percentage of net revenue from sales into the connected home market increased by as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal iptv media processor market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the iptv media processor market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of in units shipped as a result of reduced demand for our chipsets in the iptv media processor market as a result of competitive factors in connection with product transitions at telecommunications service providers to the next generation iptv media processor solutions 
our revenue from the iptv media processor market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the decrease in demand for our chipsets in the iptv media processor market 
we expect our revenue from the iptv media processor market to fluctuate in future periods as this revenue is dependent on iptv service deployments by telecommunication service providers  adoption of our newer and future generations of our technology  changes in inventory levels at the contract manufacturers that supply them and competitive market pressures 
additionally  due to decreases in the asps of our newer generation products relative to our older generation products  we must increase unit shipments of our products substantially in order to increase our revenue 
we do not expect an increase in our revenue from the iptv media processor market until at least the second half of fiscal for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our chipsets  primarily our smp and smp chipset series  into the iptv media processor market increased million  or  from fiscal this increase was attributable to improved demand in our iptv market that was partially offset by declining average selling prices due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our revenue from the iptv market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal as a result of the increase in net revenue from the connected home market 
connected media player market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the connected media player market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal  as a result of decreases of in units shipped and in asp 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to certain customers achieving cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our older generation products and also transitions to our newer generation lower asp products 
our revenue from the connected media player market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the overall decrease in units shipped into the iptv media processor market 
we expect our revenue from the connected media player market to fluctuate in future periods primarily due to the timing and nature of new product introductions by consumer electronics companies that incorporate our products and their transition to our newer generation products 
additionally  due to decreases in the asps of our newer generation products relative to our older generation products  we must increase unit shipments of our products substantially in order to increase our revenue 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products to the connected media player market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in asp for sales of our chipsets to customers who incorporate our chipsets into digital media adapters as these customers achieved cumulative volume pricing discounts on purchases of our products 
our revenue from the connected media player market as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the increase in revenue from our connected home market 
prosumer and industrial audio video market for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market decreased million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease was attributable to both a decrease in asp and a decrease in units shipped 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to lower demand from our customers who manufacture high end audio video prosumer electronics and video conferencing products 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to a shift in product mix to our lower asp next generation products 
our revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal we expect our revenue from the prosumer and industrial audio video market to fluctuate based on our ability to obtain design wins in our customers newer generation products  broad economic trends affecting business spending on video conferencing and high end audio video products and also discretionary consumer spending 
for fiscal  net revenue from sales of our products into the prosumer and industrial audio video market increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase was attributable to an increase in units shipped primarily due to strengthening demand from our existing customers and our continued effort to expand into this market 
our revenue from sales into the prosumer and industrial audio video market as a percentage of total net revenue for fiscal increased compared to fiscal other markets our other markets consist of hdtv  pc add in boards  development contracts  services and other ancillary markets 
the revenue derived from our other markets was not a significant portion of our total net revenue 
net revenue by product group our primary product group consists of our chipsets 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume designer and manufacturer customers building products for the iptv  connected home  connected media player and prosumer and industrial audio video consumer electronic markets 
sales of our chipsets accounted for approximately  and of our net revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
we derive a minor portion of our revenue from other products and services  including software development kits  engineering support services for hardware and software  engineering development for customization of chipsets and other accessories 
the revenue derived from other products and services was not a significant portion of our total net revenue 
net revenue by geographic region the following table sets forth net revenue for each geographic region based on the ship to location of customers in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  of net revenue january  of net revenue january  of net revenue asia north america europe other regions net revenue the percentage of net revenue is less than one percent 
asia our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from asia decreased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in net revenue from asia in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to lower demand for our chipset solutions for the iptv media processor  connected home and connected media player markets 
as a percentage of total net revenue by country in the asia region  china  including hong kong  represented in fiscal and in fiscal our net revenue in absolute dollars from asia increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from asia increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in net revenue from asia in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue were primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from china which resulted primarily from the increase in shipments of our home connectivity products as a result of our coppergate acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal north america our net revenue in absolute dollars from north america decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower demand in north america for our chipset solutions across all of our target markets 
for fiscal and  our net revenue generated outside north america was of our net revenue for both periods 
the overall trend has been for companies located in north america who incorporate our products into their finished products to move their production orders to large designers and manufacturers located in the asia region 
we expect our revenue from north america in any given year to fluctuate depending on whether our customers place their orders locally or through overseas manufacturers who incorporate our products into their finished products 
our net revenue in absolute dollars from north america increased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue from north america increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the increases in our net revenue from north america in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of our total net revenue were primarily attributable to increased demand in north america for our chipset solutions for our z wave and vxp products 
europe our net revenue in absolute dollars from europe decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to changes in location of the contract manufacturers used by our customers 
our net revenue from europe increased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal our net revenue in absolute dollars from europe decreased million  or  for fiscal compared to fiscal the majority of the decrease in our net revenue from europe in absolute dollars was attributable to certain european customers moving their production to asia and  to a lesser extent  a decline in demand for our products from a customer located in europe 
our net revenue from europe decreased as a percentage of our total net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in our net revenue from europe as a percentage of our total net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from asia which resulted primarily from the increase in shipments of our home connectivity products as a result of our coppergate acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal major customers the following table sets forth the major direct customers that accounted for or more of our net revenue fiscal years ended customer january  january  january  gemtek motorola gross profit and gross margin the following table sets forth gross profit and gross margin in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  change january  change january  gross profit gross margin the million decrease in gross profit and percentage point decrease in gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to a decline in our asp and decrease in units shipped  which was partially offset by an decline in average cost per chipset  or acu 
the decrease in asp was primarily due to the increase  as a percentage of total net revenue  of sales of our home networking and home control and energy management automation products and our new generation media processor products compared to sales of our older generation media processor products which had higher asps 
the decrease in units shipped was primarily due to competitive factors and the timing of new product introductions at telecommunications service providers and other consumer electronics companies 
the decrease in acu was primarily due to the same reasons noted for our asp decline and were partially offset by an increased percentage of fixed costs per unit due to the decrease in units shipped 
fixed costs include such items as depreciation and amortization and compensation costs for operations 
the decrease in gross profit was also impacted by a million provision recorded for excess inventory primarily in connection with our smp and smp series die bank during fiscal compared to million recorded in fiscal the provision for the smp was million and was triggered mainly by notification to us by a certain large volume customer that it would not order any substantial quantity of this product in the future as it had completed its transition to a next generation product sold by one of our competitors 
the total provision for the smp was million for fiscal out of which million was triggered by target customers shifting focus of their designs to a different version of our product during the second quarter 
we also recorded provisions for million of other excess and obsolete products during fiscal during fiscal we sold  scrapped or otherwise disposed of approximately million of inventory that had been previously written down 
the million increase in gross profit and percentage point increase in gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to a decline in our acu during fiscal which was partially offset by a decline in our asp 
the decline in our acu was primarily due to the increase in units shipped for our home connectivity products  which have a lower average cost than our media processor and vxp products  and a million reduction in the mark up on inventories purchased through our acquisitions of coppergate and zensys as the majority of the inventory was sold during fiscal the improvement in our acu was partially offset by an increase in our operations overhead costs of million for fiscal compared to fiscal due to a million increase in amortization of acquired intangibles primarily as a result of our acquisition of coppergate in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decline in asp was primarily due to the addition of our home connectivity product line which has a lower asp than our media processor product line

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment as of october   we concluded that an interim review of the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets should be performed due to continued reductions in our profitability  sales forecasts and market capitalization 
as a result  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million and an impairment charge for our indefinite lived in process research and development intangible assets of million during the third quarter of fiscal impairment and amortization of intangible assets during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed a review of the carrying value of our acquired intangible assets due to continued reductions in our profitability and sales forecasts  and negative cash flows from operations

we classify our expense from the amortization of acquired developed technology of million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively  as cost of revenue 
we classify our amortization expense for acquired customer relationships and trademarks of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  as sales and marketing expense 
as of january   the unamortized balance from acquired intangible assets was million  which we intend to amortize to future periods based on the remaining estimated useful life of each acquired intangible asset 
if we purchase additional intangible assets in the future  our cost of revenue or other operating expenses may increase from the amortization of those assets 
acquired intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows as of january  in thousands  except for years january  gross value impairment accumulated amortization and effect of currency translation net value weighted average remaining amortization period years developed technology customer relationships trademarks non compete agreements in process research and development stock based compensation expense the following table sets forth stock based compensation expense that is included in each functional line item in the consolidated statements of operations in thousands fiscal years ended january  january  january  cost of revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense the expensing of employee stock based payment awards will continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations

the amortization period is based on the expected vesting term of the awards 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to stock options that became fully vested during the year  partially offset by an increase in awards for newly hired and existing employees compared to the prior fiscal year 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or assume unvested equity awards in connection with any acquisitions 
interest and other income  net the following table sets forth our net interest and other income and related percentage change in thousands  except percentages fiscal years ended january  change january  change january  interest and other income  net interest and other income primarily consists of interest income from marketable securities  income from refundable research and development credits  gains or losses on foreign exchange transactions  gains or losses on sales of marketable securities and gains or losses on currency hedging activities 
the increase of million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations

impairment of investment during our second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million against strategic investments we made in a privately held  venture capital funded technology company 
this impairment charge represents million to fully write down the carrying value of our preferred stock investment and million to fully reserve the convertible note and accrued interest receivable from this company due to our expected inability to collect it 
there was no impairment of investments in fiscal or fiscal provision for benefit from income taxes we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal and provisions for income taxes of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal  and effective tax rates were approximately  and  respectively 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily because our net loss for fiscal was either in a foreign tax jurisdiction with a zero tax rate where no tax benefit could be realized or in jurisdictions where the losses were not deductible for tax purposes 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the foreign tax differential benefit resulting from the nature of our international operations of million and the federal research and development tax credits of million that became available during the last quarter of the fiscal year 
our fiscal effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to our international operations  which resulted in a foreign tax differential benefit of million and the offsetting effect of million from writing off the california deferred tax assets due to our assessment that it is not more likely than not to be realized in the future 
we benefit from tax incentives granted by local tax authorities in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the economic development board of singapore granted development and expansion incentives to our wholly owned subsidiary in singapore in for a period of four years ending march  contingent on meeting specified requirements 
our singapore subsidiary can qualify for an additional six years of development and expansion incentives if additional requirements are met 
absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore would have been for fiscal the impact of this tax holiday was to increase net income by approximately million or per diluted share in fiscal  million or per diluted share in fiscal  million or per diluted share in fiscal to date we have not complied with all of the operating conditions required by the tax incentives  and we could lose the related tax benefits prospectively and could be required to refund potentially material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive  subject to negotiation with the singapore authorities 
as a result of the tax incentives  if we are able to renegotiate and comply with modified operating conditions  we expect the income from our operations to be subject to relatively lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary income tax rules 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities as of january  and january  in thousands january  january  cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities as of january   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  which represents a decrease of million from million at january  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities was primarily the result of million in purchases of software  equipment and leasehold improvements  million of cash paid in connection with an acquisition  million for net purchases of long term marketable securities  million for the purchase of a long term note receivable  million in purchases of long term investments and million cash used in operating activities 
these outflows of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities were partially offset by million in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock through our employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans and million excess tax benefit on stock based compensation 
as of january   we held million of long term marketable securities 
although these marketable securities have maturities of greater than one year  we hold them as available for sale and may access these funds prior to their contractual maturities 
the following table sets forth the primary net cash inflows and outflows for fiscal  and in thousands fiscal years ended january  january  january  net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to a net loss of million and decreases of million in accounts payable and million in accrued liabilities 
these amounts were partially offset by non cash adjustments to the net loss of million and decreases of million in accounts receivable and million in inventory 
non cash adjustments to net loss consisted primarily of million in impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  million in depreciation and amortization expense  million in stock based compensation expense  a benefit of million from deferred income taxes and million in provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
accounts receivable and inventories decreased as a result of lower revenue which resulted in lower billings to customers and lower inventory purchases from suppliers 
inventories also decreased due to the million provision for excess inventory primarily as a result of product transitions by customers 
our annual average day s sales outstanding increased to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix 
accounts payable decreased primarily due to the timing of payment for inventory purchases 
accrued liabilities decreased primarily due to a decrease of million in accrued rebates as a result of payments made and lower revenue which led to less new rebate accruals  and a decrease of million as a result of payouts of the coppergate acquisition contingent bonus pool 
these decreases in accrued liabilities were partially offset by an increase of million in accrued license fees as a result of purchases of software licenses and design tools and a million increase in accrued taxes payable primarily for sigma designs israel  sdi limited for which estimated tax payments were not yet made 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to net income of million  non cash expenses of million  which includes an investment impairment charge of million  a million increase in accounts payable  a million decrease in accounts receivable  and a million increase in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities 
these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in inventories and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other non current assets 
non cash adjustments to net income included consisted primarily of million for depreciation and amortization  million for stock based compensation expense  million for an investment impairment charge and a benefit of million for deferred income taxes 
the increase in inventories was the result of an increase in our die bank and finished goods as a result of an easing in supply of wafers and an increase in our die bank for our newer generation products to meet forecasted demand 
despite the increase in inventories  our annualized rate of inventory turns increased to times per year for fiscal compared to times per year for fiscal as a result of the overall increase in shipments in fiscal the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payment for inventories 
the decrease in accounts receivable was primarily the result of decreased product shipments and timing of billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual average day s sales outstanding increased to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix

these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million decrease in accrued and other long term liabilities 
non cash expenses included in net income in fiscal consisted primarily of million in depreciation and amortization and million in stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in inventories was the result of successful efforts to reduce the level of our die bank and a significant increase in demand in the fourth fiscal quarter of which resulted in an increase in our annualized rate of inventory turns to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payment for inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily the result of increased billings due to increased product shipments during the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our annual average day s sales outstanding improved to days at january  compared to days at january   primarily due to timing of shipments and customer mix 
cash flows from our operating activities will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow net revenues while managing the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us  the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to purchases of software  equipment and leasehold improvements of million  cash paid in connection with an acquisition of million  purchases of notes receivable for million and purchases of long term investments for million

these usages of cash in investing activities were partially offset by net sales and maturities of long term marketable securities of million

net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal was due to million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchases and million of excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in fiscal was due to million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchases and million of excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
while we generated cash from operations for fiscal and  we consumed cash in operations during fiscal and it is likely that our operations will consume additional cash in future periods 
based on our current anticipated cash needs  we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital requirements  obligations  capital expenditures  strategic investments and other cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities during or beyond the next months and our future capital requirements may vary significantly from those currently planned 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances will continue to fluctuate based upon our ability to grow revenue  the timing of payments to us from customers and to vendors from us and the timing of inventory purchases and subsequent manufacture and sale of our products 
from time to time  we may also increase our long term investments  which will cause our marketable securities balances to decrease 
as of january   million of the million of our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
approximately million of these funds are directly or indirectly owed to the us based parent organization by our foreign subsidiaries to settle intercompany loans 
if the remaining amount of million of these funds is needed for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the us and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our us operations 
we are not aware of any trends  demands or uncertainties as a result of this policy that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our business  as a whole or that may be relevant to our financial flexibility 
our marketable securities include primarily corporate bonds  money market funds and us agency discount notes 
we monitor all of our marketable securities for impairment and if these securities are reported to have had a decline in fair value  we may need to use significant judgment to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future value of each investment including i the nature of the investment  ii the cause and duration of any impairment  iii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iv for securities with a reported decline in fair value  our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of fair value  v the extent to which fair value may differ from cost  and vi a comparison of the income generated by the securities compared to alternative investments 
we would recognize an impairment charge if a decline in the fair value of our marketable securities is judged to be other than temporary 
contractual obligations and commitments we generally do not have guaranteed price or quantity commitments from any of our suppliers 
additionally  we generally acquire products for sale to our customers based on purchase orders received as well as forecasts from such customers 
purchase orders with delivery dates greater than twelve weeks are typically cancelable without penalty to our customers 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase semiconductor wafers  other materials and finished goods from our suppliers on an eight to sixteen week lead time basis 
the following table sets forth the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter total operating leases non cancelable purchase orders off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we have investments in privately held companies  which we review annually to determine if they should be accounted for as variable interest entities 
for the year ended january   we evaluated our investments in these privately held companies and concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest from investment entities 
as a result  we account for these investments on a cost basis and do not consolidate the activity of these investee entities 
certain events can require a reassessment of our investments in privately held companies to determine if they meet the criteria for variable interest entities and to determine which stakeholders in such entities will be the primary beneficiary 
in the event of a reassessment  we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities in future periods 
as of january   we had no off balance sheet arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our operations and financial condition 
to mitigate some of the foreign currency exchange rate risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of january  and january   we held approximately million and million  respectively  of cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities 
if short term interest rates were to decrease  the decreased interest income associated with these cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would not have a significant impact on our net income loss and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity we transact our revenue in us dollars 
the us dollar is our reporting currency 
the us dollar is our functional currency except for our subsidiaries in canada  china  denmark  france  japan  taiwan and vietnam where the canadian dollar  chinese yuan  danish krone  euro  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar and vietnamese dong are the functional currencies  respectively 
additionally  a significant portion of our israel subsidiary s expenses are payroll related and are denominated in israeli shekels 
this foreign currency exposure gives rise to market risk associated with exchange rate movements of the us dollar against the israeli shekel 
to the extent the us dollar weakens against the israeli shekel  our israeli subsidiary will experience a negative impact on its results of operations 
as of january   with the exception of our israel operation  we had not entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and inter company balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
for our israel operation  we do hedge portions of our forecasted expenses that are denominated in the israeli shekel with foreign exchange forward contracts 
as of january   we had foreign exchange contracts with notional values of approximately million that mature on or before december  these hedges of cash flow exposures will only mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange exposure 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rates at january   the notional value of our derivative instruments would decline and we would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
we maintain certain cash balances denominated in the canadian dollar  chinese yuan  danish krone  euro  japanese yen  hong kong dollar  israeli shekel  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar and vietnamese dong 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by from the exchange rates at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline and we would record a charge of approximately million
