revenues are affected by pricing  the number of new customers  customer contract durations and our customer retention rate 
international revenues 
revenues from customers outside the united states represented   and of total revenues for   and  respectively 
we expect continued growth in our international revenues  as our products and services continue to gain acceptance in international markets due to our globalexpense acquisition  our investment in global distribution  and increased global awareness of our products 
in the foreign currency impact had the effect of slightly decreasing our revenues 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates have had a de minimis impact on our total revenues

results of operations fiscal years and revenues year ended september  variance dollars revenues 
table of contents year ended september  united states europe other total revenues revenues increased by  or million  in compared to this increase was primarily due to the growth in the number of customers for our subscription services as well as higher transaction volumes 
the growth in the number of customers for our subscription services reflects higher market demand for our subscription services and high rates of retention of existing subscription customers 
we believe this demand reflects the market s growing awareness of our integrated travel and expense management solutions and the increasing acceptance of outsourced services 
additionally  the foreign currency impact had the effect of slightly decreasing our revenues when compared to the same period a year ago 
we expect revenues to grow in as a result of the growing demand for our subscription service offerings  our planned increase in spending on sales and marketing  and international expansion 
cost of operations year ended september  variance dollars cost of operations percent of total revenues cost of operations expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at in both and cost of operations expense increased by  or million  in compared to the growth in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and related expenses of million driven by increased headcount of approximately to support our growing customer base and an increase of million in share based compensation 
in addition  initial set up costs that we incur and then amortize in connection with our subscription services increased by million and allocated overhead and infrastructure costs increased by million 
we expect cost of operations expenses to trend downward as a percentage of total revenues over the long term as the incremental cost to deploy and support each new customer is expected to decrease due to economies of scale anticipated in our subscription service model infrastructure 
we anticipate that cost of operations will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our capacity to deploy and support additional new customers 
sales and marketing year ended september  variance dollars sales and marketing percent of total revenues sales and marketing expenses increased by  or million  in compared to the growth in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and related expenses of million  resulting from a headcount increase of approximately to continue adding new customers and increasing penetration within our existing customer base 
there was an increase in share based compensation of million  resulting from the issuance of stock awards to existing and new employees 
additionally  customer acquisition costs and amortization of those costs increased by million  and advertising and marketing costs increased by million 
this was offset by a decrease of million in compensation expense associated with the revaluation gain from the tripit acquisition contingent consideration  primarily resulting from the decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect total sales and marketing expenses in to increase in absolute dollars compared to  driven primarily by an increase in sales personnel and marketing programs globally 
these increases reflect a key part of our strategic focus in  which is to expand our sales and marketing efforts to create greater awareness of our subscription services in our target markets and to support expected demand 
systems development and programming costs 
table of contents year ended september  variance dollars systems development and programming percent of total revenues systems development and programming costs as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent year over year 
systems development and programming costs increased by or million  in compared to the growth in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and related expenses of million  driven by an increase in headcount of approximately 
additionally  depreciation expenses increased by million as we continued to upgrade and extend our service offerings and develop new technologies 
the increases were offset by a decrease of million in compensation expense associated with the tripit acquisition contingent consideration  primarily resulting from the decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in response to the demand for our subscription services  the majority of our systems and development resources are focused on developing internal use software used to provide these services to our customers 
we capitalize costs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap for software developed or obtained for internal use and amortize it over its estimated useful life 
capitalized internal use software costs  net of amortization  increased by million  to million at september  as compared to million at september  we anticipate that recognized systems development and programming costs in will increase in absolute dollars compared to as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement 
general and administrative year ended september  variance dollars general and administrative percent of total revenues general and administrative expenses increased by  or million  in compared to the growth in absolute dollars was primarily due to an increase in million of personnel costs and related expenses  driven by an increase in headcount of approximately to support our growth and million increase in share based compensation  resulting from additional equity awards issued to employees 
additionally  infrastructure costs increased by million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of million in professional fees mainly attributable to lower acquisition  litigation and other related costs in we expect the absolute dollar amount of general and administrative expenses to increase in compared to due to increases in personnel costs and infrastructure costs related to the growth of our business 
revaluation of contingent consideration year ended september  variance dollars revaluation of contingent consideration gain loss percent of total revenues revaluation of contingent consideration consisted of a gain of million primarily relating to the tripit acquisition for compared to a loss of million for the change in inputs applied to the valuation during the current period  which consisted primarily of the increase in our stock price  resulted in the change in the amount of the contingent consideration

income tax expense year ended september  variance dollars income tax expense effective tax rate the effective income tax rate for was compared to for the negative effective tax rate for was primarily the result of losses in tax jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit  losses in tax jurisdictions where we have recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the establishment of income tax reserves  partially offset by income from the revaluation of the contingent consideration which is not subject to income taxes  research and development tax credits  and earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states  measured against a pretax loss for the year 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
the overall effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws in these operating jurisdictions 
we monitor the assumptions used in estimating the annual effective tax rate and make adjustments  if required  throughout the year 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in estimating our annual income tax rates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we then must measure the benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
for those positions that require a reserve and are in a net operating loss position  we do not include interest and penalties related to those contingencies in our income tax expense

please see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of the acquisition related contingent consideration 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  such estimates and judgments are periodically re evaluated 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
the estimates and judgments noted above are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies are those we deem most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  including those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  income taxes  business combinations  contingent consideration  investments  intangible assets  and allowances for accounts receivable 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from the delivery of subscription services and  to a much lesser degree  set up fees in connection with subscription services  and consulting services 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we recognize revenue when the following criteria have been met evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if collection is not considered probable  we recognize revenues when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or 
table of contents determinable  we recognize revenues as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgment as to the probability of collection and determinability of fees may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the acceptance period or satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria  as applicable 
set up fees paid by customers in connection with subscription services  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred until customer implementation is complete and are recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships 
consulting services consist of fees for professional services  which relate to system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription revenue  we primarily consider the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the subscription service start date 
consulting services that are sold with the subscription service are recognized ratably over the expected lives of the customer relationships 
consulting services that are sold after the initial contract are typically fixed fee contracts and are recognized as revenue upon delivery 
we also sell consulting services under milestone or time and materials contracts and  in such cases  recognize consulting revenues as milestones are completed or services are performed 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
when we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the revenues on a gross basis and amounts paid to our reseller partners are recognized as sales and marketing expense 
our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  establish pricing of the arrangement and are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
when our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and sales and marketing expenses 
income taxes we make estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine it is more likely than not that we will be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  then an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are not likely to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to increase income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
we measure and recognize uncertain tax positions 
to recognize such positions we must first determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit 
we must then measure the benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
for those positions that require a reserve and are in a net operating loss position  we do not include interest and penalties related to those contingencies in our income tax expense 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date based upon their estimated fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date represents the excess of the purchase consideration of an acquired business over the fair value of the underlying net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation and valuation require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include but are not limited to estimates about future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  proprietary technology and non compete agreements  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  as well as expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business 
table of contents combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we continue to evaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to the preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period 
subsequent to the measurement period  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
other estimates associated with the accounting for these acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
contingent consideration we estimate the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration using various valuation approaches including the monte carlo simulation approach and discounted cash flow model 
acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities are classified as level liabilities  because we use significant unobservable inputs  reflecting our assessment of the assumptions market participants would use to value these liabilities 
the fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period  with any change in the value recorded as income or expense 
investments our investment portfolio primarily includes strategic investments in privately held companies 
we account for our strategic investments under either the cost or equity method of accounting 
all of our strategic investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is  in part  subjective and influenced by many factors 
when assessing our investments for other than temporary declines in value  we consider many factors  including but not limited to the following the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan  the investee s revenue and cost trends  the investee s liquidity and cash position  and market acceptance of the investee s products and services 
from time to time  we may consider third party valuations 
in the event an investment experiences other than temporary declines in value  we will record an impairment loss in other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets we evaluate our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset or group of assets 
the amount of any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset 
we also evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives of our intangible assets are complex and subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
accounts receivable allowances we record provisions for estimated sales allowances against subscription and consulting revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we estimate our sales allowances by reviewing the aging of our receivables  analyzing our history of credits issued  and evaluating the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts 
past due receivable balances are written off when our efforts have been unsuccessful in collecting the amount due 
new accounting standards see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of new accounting pronouncements  including the respective expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate  foreign exchange  market and market interest risks 
interest rate risk 
we have cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as of september  short term investments were invested primarily in highly liquid investment vehicles including money market instruments that bear interest at variable overnight or short term rates 
the cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are held for working capital purposes 
our short term investments are made for capital preservation purposes 
we do not enter into short term investments for trading or speculative purposes 

table of contents our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
an immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates of basis points at september   could result in a million reduction or increase in the fair value of the underlying short term investments 
this estimate is based on a sensitivity model that measures market value changes when changes in interest rates occur 
fluctuations in the value of our investment securities caused by a change in interest rates gains or losses on the carrying value are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  and are realized only if we sell the underlying securities 
as of september   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
an immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a million reduction or increase in the fair value of the underlying short term investments 
market risk and market interest risk 
in march we issued at par value million principal amount of senior convertible notes due in in addition  the underwriters executed their option to purchase an additional million principal amount of such notes  bringing the total amount of such notes to million notes 
holders may convert their notes prior to maturity upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder an amount of cash equal to the principal amount of the notes 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  will be paid in stock 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate note hedge transactions and the sale of warrants 
these separate transactions were completed to reduce the potential economic dilution from the conversion of the notes 
for at least trading days during the consecutive trading day period ended september   the company s common stock price exceeded of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day 
accordingly  the notes are convertible at the holders option for the quarter ending december  and the notes are classified as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
the notes were not convertible at the option of their holders as of september  our notes have fixed annual interest rates at and therefore  interest expense from these notes is not subject to fluctuation based on changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the notes will fluctuate based on changes in market interest rates 
generally  the fair market value of our fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
in addition  the fair value of our notes is affected by our stock price 
the carrying value of our notes was million as of september  this represents the liability component of the million principal balance as of september  the total estimated fair value of our notes at september  was million and the fair value was determined based on the average trading price per of the notes as of the last day of trading for the fourth quarter of fiscal  which was 
for further information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held companies  some of which are in the development stage 
when we do not have the ability to exert significant influence  we account for investments under the cost method of accounting 
we account for investments under the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investee 
as of september  and total strategic investments were million and million  respectively 
if any of these companies fail  or if we choose to dispose of our investment at a time when any of these companies is not meeting our objectives or expectations  we could lose all or part of our investment 
if the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value and we determine it is other than temporarily impaired  we may be required to record impairment charges that negatively impact our result of operations and financial condition 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the euro  canadian dollar  british pound sterling  australian dollar  and czech koruna 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
we may seek to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging certain balance sheet exposures with foreign currency forward contracts 
any gain or loss from settling these contracts would offset by the loss or gain derived from the underlying balance sheet exposures 
additionally  by policy  we do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes
