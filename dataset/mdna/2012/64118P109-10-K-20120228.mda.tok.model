overview we design  manufacture and sell high performance  intelligent memory subsystems for datacenter server and high performance computing and communications markets 
our memory subsystems consist of combinations of dram ics  nand  asics and other components assembled on pcbs 
we primarily market and sell our products to leading oem customers 
our solutions are targeted at applications where memory plays a key role in meeting system performance requirements 
we leverage a portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques  including efficient planar design  alternative packaging techniques and custom semiconductor logic  to deliver memory subsystems with high memory density  small form factor  high signal integrity  attractive thermal characteristics and low cost per bit 
in november  we introduced hypercloud ddr memory technology 
hypercloud utilizes an asic chipset that incorporates netlist patented rank multiplication technology that increases memory capacity and load reduction technology that increases memory bandwidth 
we expect that these patented technologies will make possible improved levels of performance for memory intensive datacenter applications and workloads  including enterprise virtualization  cloud computing infrastructure  business intelligence real time data analytics  and high performance computing 
hypercloud memory has been under evaluation by several of our oem customers for use in their server products 
in february  we achieved memory qualification of hypercloud at certain major oems 
in november  we introduced a gb two virtual rank rdimm integrating hypercloud with our proprietary planar x technology 
the new memory module enables up to gb of dram memory in next generation two processor servers 
additionally  we announced collaborative agreements with each of hewlett packard company hp and international business machines ibm  pursuant to which these oems have agreed to cooperate with us in efforts to qualify hypercloud memory products for use with their respective products 
after qualification is achieved by one or both of these oems  the qualifying oems will engage with us in joint marketing and further product development efforts 
we and each of the oems have committed financial and other resources toward the collaboration 
however  the efforts undertaken under either of the collaborative agreements may not result in any new revenues for us 
in february  we announced general availability of nvvault battery free 
like the nvvault battery powered product  nvvault battery free provides non volatile cache memory subsystem targeting raid  storage virtualization and other cache protection and data logging applications 
nvvault products provide server and storage oems a solution for enhanced datacenter fault recovery 
unlike our traditional battery powered fault tolerant cache product which relied solely on batteries to power the cache  nvvault battery free utilizes a combination of dram for high throughput performance and flash for extended data retention 
the introduction of nvvault battery free  as well as the launch of the current version of the battery powered module in connection with dell s introduction of the perc line of servers in december  has resulted in nvvault 
table of contents revenues of million  or of total revenues for we expect a decline of dell nvvault sales through following intel s launch of its romley platform in the first quarter of this reduction in sales could have a significant impact on our revenues and gross profit as soon as the second quarter of in order to leverage our nvvault technology into a more diverse customer base  we continue to pursue additional qualifications of nvvault with other customers 
we also introduced expressvault in march and we are in the process of qualifying next generation ddr nvvault with customers 
while nearly of sales were made to dell  as a result of our diversification efforts  approximately of nvvault revenues in were to other customers 
the remainder of our revenues arose primarily from oem sales of specialty memory modules and flash based products  the majority of which were utilized in data center and industrial applications 
when developing modules for an equipment product launch  we engage with our oem customers from the earliest stages of new product definition  providing us unique insight into their full range of system architecture and performance requirements 
this close collaboration has also allowed us to develop a significant level of systems expertise 
we leverage a portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques  including efficient planar design  alternative packaging techniques and custom semiconductor logic  to deliver memory subsystems with high speed  capacity and signal integrity  small form factor  attractive thermal characteristics and low cost per bit 
revenues from specialty modules and flash based products are subject to fluctuation as a result of the life cycles of the products into which our modules are incorporated 
our ability to continue to produce revenues from specialty memory modules and flash based products is dependent on our ability to qualify our products on new platforms as current platforms reach the end of their lifecycles  and on the state of the global economy 
consistent with the concentrated nature of the oem customer base in our target markets  a small number of large customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
one customer represented approximately of our net sales in and two customers represented approximately and of our net sales in key business metrics the following describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations that are important to management s assessment of our financial performance net sales 
net sales consist primarily of sales of our high performance memory subsystems  net of a provision for estimated returns under our right of return policies  which generally range up to days 
we generally do not have long term sales agreements with our customers 
although oem customers typically provide us with non binding forecasts of future product demand over specific periods of time  they generally place orders with us approximately two weeks in advance of scheduled delivery 
selling prices are typically negotiated monthly  based on competitive market conditions and the current price of dram ics and nand 
purchase orders generally have no cancellation or rescheduling penalty provisions 
we often ship our products to our customers international manufacturing sites 
all of our sales to date  however  are denominated in us dollars 
we also sell excess component inventory of dram ics and nand to distributors and other users of memory ics 
as compared to previous years  component inventory sales remain a relatively small percentage of net sales as a result of our efforts to diversify both our customer and product line bases 
this diversification effort has also allowed us to use components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
we expect that component inventory sales will continue to represent a minimal portion of our net sales in future periods 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  manufacturing costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment  inventory valuation provisions  stock based compensation  and occupancy costs and other allocated fixed costs 
the dram ics and nand incorporated into our products constitute a significant portion of our cost of sales  and thus our cost of sales will fluctuate 
table of contents based on the current price of dram ics and nand 
we attempt to pass through such dram ic and nand flash memory cost fluctuations to our customers by frequently renegotiating pricing prior to the placement of their purchase orders 
however  the sales prices of our memory subsystems can also fluctuate due to competitive situations unrelated to the pricing of dram ics and nand  which affects gross margins 
the gross margin on our sales of excess component dram ic and nand inventory is much lower than the gross margin on our sales of our memory subsystems 
as a result  fluctuations in dram ic and nand inventory sales as a percentage of our overall sales could impact our overall gross margin 
we assess the valuation of our inventories on a quarterly basis and record a provision to cost of sales as necessary to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee and independent contractor compensation and related costs  stock based compensation  non recurring engineering fees  computer aided design software licenses  reference design development costs  patent filing and protection legal fees  depreciation or rental of evaluation equipment  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
also included in research and development expense are the costs of material and overhead related to the production of engineering samples of new products under development or products used solely in the research and development process 
our customers typically do not separately compensate us for design and engineering work involved in developing application specific products for them 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures will increase in future periods as we seek to expand new product opportunities  increase our activities related to new and emerging markets and continue to develop additional proprietary technologies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related costs  stock based compensation  independent sales representative commissions  professional services  promotional and other selling and marketing expenses  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
a significant portion of our selling effort is directed at building relationships with oems and other customers and working through the product approval and qualification process with them 
therefore  the cost of material and overhead related to products manufactured for qualification is included in selling expenses 
as we continue to service existing and establish new customers  we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may result in material adverse effects on our operating results and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic accordingly  we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  product delivery and acceptance have occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents we generally use customer purchase orders and or contracts as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped for customers with fob shipping point terms and upon receipt for customers with fob destination terms  at which time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery and customer acceptance 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund 
customers are generally allowed limited rights of return for up to days  except for sales of excess component inventories  which contain no right of return privileges 
estimated returns are provided for at the time of sale based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
we offer a standard product warranty to our customers and have no other post shipment obligations 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and evaluations  as well as the customer s payment history 
all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as net sales  while all costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt instruments 
other than for certain investments in auction rate securities  commercial paper and short term corporate bonds  the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or level inputs 
because of their short term nature  commercial paper and short term corporate bonds are not frequently traded 
although there are observable quotes for these securities  the markets are not considered active 
accordingly  the fair values of these investments are based on level inputs 
the fair value of our auction rate securities is determined based on level inputs 
we recognize transfers between levels through of the fair value hierarchy at the beginning of the reporting period 
we believe that the carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values due to their nature and respective durations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended to our customers as deemed necessary  but generally require no collateral 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale  we will record an allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based primarily on the length of time the receivables are past due based on the terms of the originating transaction  the current business environment and our historical experience 
uncollectible accounts are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all cost effective commercial means of collection have been exhausted 
generally  our credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience credit loss rates similar to those we have experienced in the past 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated among a small number of customers  and a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the net realizable value of the inventory 
cost is determined on an average cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and includes raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess quantities and obsolescence 
among other factors  we consider 
table of contents historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value 
in addition  we consider changes in the market value of dram ics and nand in determining the net realizable value of our raw material inventory 
once established  any write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of our excess or obsolete inventories 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventories are sold 
in addition  should the market value of dram ics or nand decrease significantly  we may be required to lower our selling prices to reflect the lower current cost of our raw materials 
if such price decreases reduce the net realizable value of our inventories to less than our cost  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales in the same period 
although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological developments or the market value of dram ics or nand could have a material effect on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets held and used in our operations for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset or asset group is based on market value when available  or when unavailable  on discounted expected cash flows 
warranty reserve 
we offer product warranties generally ranging from one to three years  depending on the product and negotiated terms of purchase agreements with our customers 
such warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
warranties are not offered on sales of excess inventory 
our estimates for warranty related costs are recorded at the time of sale based on historical and estimated future product return rates and expected repair or replacement costs 
while such costs have historically been consistent between periods and within our expectations and the provisions established  unexpected changes in failure rates could have a material adverse impact on us  requiring additional warranty reserves  and adversely affecting our gross profit and gross margins 
stock based compensation 
we account for equity issuances to non employees in accordance with asc topic all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the third party performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur 

table of contents in accordance with asc topic  employee and director stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
given that stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc topic requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our estimated average forfeiture rates are based on historical forfeiture experience and estimated future forfeitures 
the fair value of common stock option awards to employees and directors is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires subjective assumptions regarding future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  along with assumptions about the risk free interest rate and expected dividends  all of which affect the estimated fair values of our common stock option awards 
the expected term of options granted is calculated as the average of the weighted vesting period and the contractual expiration date of the option 
this calculation is based on the safe harbor method permitted by the sec in instances where the vesting and exercise terms of options granted meet certain conditions and where limited historical exercise data is available 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free rate selected to value any particular grant is based on the us treasury rate that corresponds to the expected term of the grant effective as of the date of the grant 
the expected dividends assumption is based on our history and our expectations regarding dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our common stock option awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in prior periods 
compensation expense for common stock option awards with graded vesting schedules is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the last separately vesting portion of the award  provided that the accumulated cost recognized as of any date at least equals the value of the vested portion of the award 
we recognize the fair value of restricted stock awards issued to employees and outside directors as stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period for the last separately vesting portion of the awards 
fair value is determined as the difference between the closing price of our common stock on the grant date and the purchase price of the restricted stock award  if any  reduced by expected forfeitures 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying vested or unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense  or record additional expense for vested stock based awards 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation may increase to the extent that we grant additional common stock options or other stock based awards 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future tax effects of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the consolidated financial statements  calculated at enacted tax rates for expected periods of realization 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  when determined necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
because we have operated at a loss for an extended period of time  we did not recognize deferred tax assets related to losses incurred in benefits recognized in were limited to those made available as a one time carry back through economic recovery legislation 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record an income tax benefit or a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 

table of contents asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position that has been taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
under asc topic we may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities

the increase in net sales for as compared with resulted primarily from increases of approximately i million in sales of nvvault rdimms used in cache protection and data logging applications  including million from the launch of nvvault battery free  the flash based cache system that became generally available in  ii million in sales of flash memory products  resulting from existing and new customer qualifications  and iii million in sales of hypercloud memory modules  offset by a decrease of million in sales of specialty memory modules used in industrial applications as one customer slowed production as a result of its product nearing the end of its life cycle 
approximately of our nvvault sales were made to dell in we expect a decline of dell nvvault sales through following intel s launch of its romley platform in the first quarter of this reduction in sales could have a significant impact on our revenue and gross profit 
we expect an increasing percentage of our revenue to come from sales of nvvault to a more diverse customer base  as well as from sales of our hypercloud products 
gross profit and gross margin 
the overall improvements in gross profit and gross margin are due to increased sales and manufacturing volume  as well as a shift in sales toward higher margin products 
gross profit for as compared to increased due to the increase in net sales between the two periods  resulting in an improved ability to absorb fixed manufacturing costs 
these volume based improvements were augmented by decreased dram prices  which positively affected margins in some product categories 
as noted previously  the expected decline in dell nvvault sales could have a significant impact on our revenue and gross profit 
research and development

for further discussion see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
included in the unrecognized tax benefits at december  and january  was approximately million and million  respectively  of tax positions that  if recognized  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately  during as a result of a lapse in a federal statute of limitations  resulting in an income tax benefit 
in  we began operating under tax holidays in the prc  which are effective from january through december since we operated at a loss in the prc in and  we did not realize any benefit attributable to the tax holidays 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through issuances of equity and debt securities and cash generated from operations 
we have also funded our operations with a revolving line of credit and term loans under our bank credit facility  capitalized lease obligations  and from the sale and leaseback of our domestic manufacturing facility 
working capital  cash and cash equivalents  and marketable securities 
the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities in thousands december  january  working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital our working capital increased slightly in increases in operating assets resulting from our increase in sales and investments in inventory required to support the development of our hypercloud products were financed with the proceeds of a million term loan  a portion of which matures on a long term basis

table of contents operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended january  was primarily the result of i a net loss of approximately million and ii approximately million in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
cash used to fund net losses is reduced by approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
accounts receivable increased approximately million at december  compared with january   primarily as a result of net sales of million in the fourth quarter of compared with million in the fourth quarter of during and  we were successful in collecting cash from sales to our customers substantially in accordance with our standard payment terms to those customers 
inventories increased approximately million during primarily due to qualification activities for our hypercloud products 
specifically  we received million under a purchase commitment for asic devices and purchased inventory to build samples that we are required to supply as a result of our hypercloud collaboration agreements with hp and ibm 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based on  among other factors  the level of customer orders received and overall demand as well as the stage at which our products are in their respective life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace 
we make efforts to balance such considerations against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
accounts payable  net of amounts due for property and equipment purchases  decreased approximately million during despite increased production levels  primarily as a result of expansion of trade credit  and continued stringent cash management 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended january  was primarily the result of i a net loss of approximately million and ii approximately million in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
cash used to fund net losses is reduced by approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
investing activities 
in and  we continued to invest remaining net proceeds from our public offerings and debt financing in various money market and marketable securities investments in connection with our efforts to both preserve capital as well as achieve competitive returns on our investments 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities of approximately million 
we also used approximately million in cash primarily to purchase equipment related to our production facilities in the prc and our research and development activities in irvine  california 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended january  was primarily the result of proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of investments in marketable securities of approximately million 
we also used approximately million in cash primarily to purchase equipment 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the net proceeds of million from a new term loan obtained from silicon valley bank and million from the sale of  shares of our common stock through our sales agreement with ascendiant  described below under the caption capital resources  offset by repayments of million on the term loans and capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended january  was primarily the result of the net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a registered public offering  which closed on march   and the proceeds of a million term loan obtained from silicon valley bank  offset by repayments of million on the term loan and capital lease obligations 

table of contents in and  we utilized our lines of credit with silicon valley bank to fund short term working capital needs and collateralize vendor credit 
capital resources 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with silicon valley bank  which was amended on march   june   september   may  and august  currently  the credit agreement provides for a line of credit pursuant to which we can borrow up to the lesser of i of eligible accounts receivable  or ii million 
we have the option to increase credit availability to million at any time through the maturity date of september   subject to the conditions of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains an overall sublimit of million to collateralize our contingent obligations under letters of credit  foreign exchange contracts and cash management services 
amounts outstanding under the overall sublimit reduce the amount available pursuant to the credit agreement 
at october   letters of credit in the amount of million were outstanding 
the letters of credit expired in october  and were renewed for million through october  interest on the line of credit is payable monthly at either i prime plus  as long as we maintain million in revolving credit availability plus unrestricted cash on deposit with the bank  or ii prime plus 
additionally  the credit agreement requires payments for an unused line  as well as anniversary and early termination fees  as applicable 
the following table presents details of outstanding borrowings and availability under our line of credit in thousands december  january  availability under the revolving line of credit outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit amounts reserved under credit sublimits unutilized borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit outstanding borrowings under the silicon valley bank line of credit did not exceed million at any time during or in addition  in connection with the september  amendment  silicon valley bank extended a million term loan under the credit agreement  which bears interest at a rate of prime plus 
we are required to make equal monthly principal payments over the month term  which total million annually 
in may  silicon valley bank extended an additional million term loan  and extended the term of the existing credit facility through september  which eliminated the potential balloon payment on the first term loan 
the second term loan bears interest at a rate of prime plus  and is payable in equal installments over the month term of the loan  totaling million annually 
as of december   million was outstanding under the term loans 
all obligations under the credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on our tangible and intangible assets 
the only restriction on the use of funds under the revolving line of credit is that we must be in compliance with the covenants of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants with respect to our liquidity and tangible net worth and restrictions on the payment of dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants and expect to maintain compliance for the foreseeable future 
however  we have in the past been in violation of one or more covenants of other credit agreements  and we could violate one or more covenants in the future 
if we were to be in violation of covenants 
table of contents under our credit agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances and we could lose vendor credit should the letters of credit issued under the credit agreement become unavailable 
if that were to occur  we may be unable to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of funding  such acceleration would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
on november   we entered into a sales agreement with ascendiant as sales agent 
in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement  we may issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
sales of shares of our common stock may be made in a series of transactions from time to time as we may direct ascendiant in sales deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in rule under the securities act of such sales are made pursuant to our effective million shelf registration statement filed with the sec in september as of december   we had received net proceeds of approximately million raised through the sale of approximately  shares 
we may terminate the sales agreement with ascendiant at any time 
as a result of such termination  we would expect to make available any remaining unsold portion of the million in aggregate offering price for any other sources of financing that are permitted under the effective shelf registration statement 
the sales agreement with ascendiant does not preclude us from pursuing other sources of financing 
we have in the past utilized equipment leasing arrangements to finance certain capital expenditures 
equipment leases continue to be a financing alternative that we expect to pursue in the future 
we believe our existing cash balances  borrowing availability under our bank credit facility  and the cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our levels of net sales  the timing and extent of expenditures to support research and development activities  the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally and the continued market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or may choose  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
these additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships
