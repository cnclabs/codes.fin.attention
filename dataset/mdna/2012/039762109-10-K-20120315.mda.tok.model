item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  the gelson s store in northridge  california was subsequently closed on february  gelson s offers a broad selection of local and national brands as well as a limited number of private label items 
gelson s targets the consumer who values superior customer service  merchandise  presentation and selection 
gelson s also operates a distribution center in the city of commerce  california 
store formats and business strategy gelson s business strategy is to offer a comfortable upscale shopping experience which is superior to its competitors in terms of customer service and merchandise quality  selection and presentation 
the goal of this strategy is to continue to develop and maintain gelson s loyal base of customers and appeal to potential new customers 
central elements of this strategy are as follows merchandise the merchandise offerings in the markets are tailored in response to gelson s customer profile 
gelson s stores  which range in size from approximately  to  square feet  typically carry a wide range of items  including traditional grocery categories such as dry groceries  produce  meat  seafood  bakery  dairy  wine and liquor  floral  sushi  vitamins and health and beauty aids 
gelson s perishables are typically premium products  which are rigorously maintained and culled as appropriate to assure quality and freshness 
gelson s merchandising includes specialty items such as imported foods  unusual delicatessen items and organic and natural food products 
service gelson s emphasizes customer service by offering a variety of service departments including meat  seafood  delicatessen  floral  sushi  cheese and bakery departments 
all sushi and most bakery departments are operated by third parties 
some gelson s stores include additional service departments such as fresh pizza  coffee bars  self service hot and cold food cases  gelato bars and carving carts offering cooked poultry and meats 
additionally  selected stores offer banking and pharmacy services through third parties 
stores are staffed so that  even at peak times  customer checkout time is minimized 
in addition to checkers  there are personnel assigned to bagging and assisting customers 
all employees are encouraged to know customers by name and assist them whenever possible 
all stores offer a company charge card to qualified customers in addition to the option of paying for their purchases with cash  checks  credit or debit cards 
stores are typically open to hours per day  with hours of operation determined by local code  lease provisions or as appropriate for the business characteristics of each community 
presentation all stores are maintained in accordance with extremely high standards 
personnel continually fill and face shelves with product 
produce and other perishables are trimmed and culled to maintain quality and appearance 
pricing the pricing strategy at the stores is to be competitive primarily within their market niches  ranging from the more traditional to the more exotic  specialty or high end retailers 
expansion and store development management regularly evaluates the feasibility of opening new stores in and outside its existing trade areas and remodeling existing stores in order to maximize the existing stores appeal to consumers and their profit potential 
in  capital expenditures totaled  advertising and promotion gelson s advertises on a limited basis in newspapers and through its own newsletter 
in the past  advertising has focused primarily on the promotion of events rather than prices  for example  gelson s emphasizes special holiday selections  new products  specialty items  services and recipes 
with the downturn in the economy  the company has redirected more of its advertising to focus on competitive pricing and direct mail of discount coupons as consumers have become more price conscious 
in addition  gelson s maintains a website at www 
gelsons 
com which allows customers to learn more about gelson s and to read about food related topics that may be of interest to them 
the website also provides an opportunity for customers to request a newsletter  offer feedback and to place catering and holiday meal orders online 
the company reevaluates its strategy regularly in an effort to identify the most effective means of attracting and retaining customers 
competition the retail grocery business is highly competitive 
competition in the supermarket business is based upon price  merchandise variety and quality  service and location 
the number of stores  market share and brand awareness are also important competitive factors 
gelson s is in direct competition with numerous local outlets of regional and national supermarket chains most of which have greater resources and a larger market share than gelson s  independent grocery stores  convenience stores  specialty and gourmet markets and food and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
the stores of the national and regional chains are generally larger than gelson s stores which  in some cases  enables them to offer more products  and their greater resources allow them to conduct more comprehensive advertising campaigns 
competition also exists from other types of retailers with respect to particular products 
gelson s competes primarily by offering a combination of high quality products and superior customer service 
the company also believes that gelson s prime store locations and long standing reputation add to its competitive strength 
certain competitors of gelson s offer home delivery  in store banks and pharmacies in addition to their existing retail store operations 
gelson s has  in the past  evaluated opportunities for home delivery  but has elected not to do so at this time 
a few of gelson s stores offer in store banks and pharmacies  most of gelson s stores are not large enough for such additional facilities 
seasonality gelson s business is somewhat seasonal with sales tending to increase during the last quarter of the year due to the holiday season and related specialty merchandise 
support and other services each store has an on site stockroom  the size of which varies for each store 
in addition  gelson s operates a  square foot warehouse in the city of commerce  california 
the central warehouse distributes fresh produce  liquor  wine  floral and certain grocery items to the stores 
the stores also receive meat  delicatessen  paper goods  health and beauty aids  hardware and supply items from the warehouse on a limited basis 
the bulk of all merchandise purchasing takes place at gelson s headquarters in encino  california 
approximately of the purchases for were distributed through the central warehouse  the remainder was delivered directly to the stores from manufacturers  distributors or wholesalers 
the central purchasing and distribution operations are conducted based on electronic in store ordering systems 
stores can place and receive orders up to six days per week 
perishables are ordered more frequently than other goods 
the largest supplier for the stores is unified grocers  inc unified  a grocery wholesale cooperative  which has been a supplier to the company for approximately years and which accounted for approximately of gelson s purchases in fiscal no other supplier accounts for more than of gelson s purchases 
the company believes that there would be a negative short term impact if the company were to lose unified as a supplier for gelson s  but that such impact could possibly be mitigated by a combination of events  which could include purchasing certain items for direct store delivery and purchasing some products through other wholesalers 
however  such a loss could have a short term adverse effect on the performance of gelson s 
employees gelson s had approximately  full time and part time store  warehouse and office employees as of december  most gelson s employees are covered by union collective bargaining agreements that establish rates of pay  benefits  work rules and procedures for the orderly settlement of disputes 
in general  these agreements have been negotiated on a local industry wide basis 
in addition to employees at gelson s  arden mayfair had approximately employees at its executive and headquarters offices as of december   some of whom are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
governmental regulation gelson s is subject to regulation by a variety of governmental agencies  including the us food and drug administration  the california department of alcoholic beverage control  and state and local health departments 
the company believes that gelson s store operations comply in all material respects with federal  state and local health  environmental and other laws and regulations 
although the company cannot predict the effect of future laws or regulations on its operations  expenditures for continued compliance with current laws are not expected to have a material adverse impact on gelson s competitive position or the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
certain statements contained in this item a  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  other parts of this report and other company filings are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss  among other things  future sales  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
forward looking statements reflect the company s current plans and expectations regarding important risk factors and are based on information currently known to the company 
the company cautions readers that any forward looking statements contained in this report or made by the management of the company involve risks and uncertainties  and are subject to change based on various important factors 
such statements may be identified by such words as anticipate  expect  may  believe  could  estimate  project  maybe  appears  intend  plan and similar words or phrases 
the company does not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements 
the factors listed below  among others  could affect the company s financial results and could cause the company s financial performance to differ materially from the expectations expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on behalf of the company changes in economic  political or social conditions our profitability may be impacted by both national and local economic conditions  particularly in southern california 
changes in economic conditions such as recessionary cycles  increased levels of unemployment  higher consumer debt levels  inflation  higher interest rates and tax rates and increased energy costs may result in reduced consumer spending or influence our customers to shift their spending to our lower priced competitors 
the depressed state of the economy  including its impact on the unemployment rate  the financial markets and the real estate markets  as well as the effects of budget uncertainties in california  have and will continue to influence consumer spending patterns in the future 
in addition  current market conditions have continued to limit the amount that the company can charge for its products and the company has continued to emphasize price specials and discount coupons in its advertising 
if the company s sales volume decreases or if the company is unable to pass increased costs on to its customers  profit margins may be negatively affected 
in addition  our business may be subject to interruption from acts of terrorism  national emergencies or natural disasters 
competition in the grocery business the retail grocery business is intensely competitive with respect to price  food quality and selection  service and location 
the company is in direct competition with numerous local outlets of regional and national supermarket chains  independent grocery stores  convenience stores  specialty and gourmet markets and food and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
there are a number of well established competitors with substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than ours  many of which are also nonunion 
the company frequently faces the opening of a new or remodeled competitor s store in its trade area 
consequently  the company also must continually maintain its existing stores in order to retain their appeal 
an inability to successfully compete with other grocery retailers in our trade areas could prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability 
food and drug safety concerns there is increasing governmental scrutiny and public awareness regarding food and drug safety 
the company could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the company s food and drug products 
any events that give rise to actual or potential food contamination  drug contamination or food borne illness could result in product liability claims and a loss of consumer confidence 
in addition  adverse publicity about these types of concerns whether valid or not  may discourage consumers from buying the company s products or cause production and delivery disruptions  which could have an adverse effect on the company s sales and results of operations 
new labor contracts and labor stoppages the majority of our employees belong to unions with which we have labor agreements which establish rates of pay  benefits  work rules and procedures for the orderly settlement of disputes 
in order to continue to attract and retain quality personnel  we may accept terms that increase our operating costs  which in turn  may negatively impact our profitability 
if contract negotiations are not successful  the union could recommend that our employees vote to strike our stores  distribution center and offices 
the majority of gelson s employees are members of the united food commercial workers international union ufcw 
in september  the ufcw completed negotiation of a new contract with the three major grocery retailers in our trade area vons  ralphs and albertsons grocery chains majors 
the wage rates agreed to by these three competitors were somewhat less than the company agreed to for certain job classifications and experience levels during our ufcw negotiations which were completed in october this could affect our ability to compete with grocery retailers whose labor costs are less than our own 
our contract with the ufcw expires march   the same as the major s contract 
cost of providing employee benefits the company provides health insurance for the majority of its non union employees  for which the employees pay a portion 
health care costs have increased significantly in recent years 
if this trend continues  it could have a negative impact on the company s profitability 
the status of the recent health care reform makes it more difficult than ever to predict the impact on health care costs in the near future 
the company also contributes to several multi employer union health care plans in accordance with the company s various collective bargaining agreements 
all employers who participate in a multi employer plan are required to contribute at the same hourly rate based on straight time hours worked in order to fund the plan 
the company s contributions under the ufcw health care plan are scheduled to increase every march through the term of the current agreement which expires on march  contributions to the ufcw health care plan have increased substantially in recent years 
the same issues that impact the cost of providing health care to our nonunion employees  as discussed above  may also impact the cost of providing health care to our union employees 
the company participates in various multi employer union pension plans 
adverse economic and financial market developments have significantly impacted the funded status of pension plans on a worldwide basis in recent years 
currently  the company s contributions under the ufcw pension plan are already established in accordance with the terms of the current agreement which expires on march  however  the most recently available certified zone status provided by the plan trust indicates that the plan was in critical status less than percent funded as defined by the pension protection act of for the year ended march  a rehabilitation plan has been implemented and includes a schedule of benefit cuts and contribution rate increases that allows for projected emergence from critical status at the end of the rehabilitation period on march  if the funded status of the plan deteriorates or if the rehabilitation plan is unsuccessful or if any of the participating employers in the plans withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the underfunded liabilities associated with its participants  the company may be required to make additional contributions in the future 
each of these scenarios  as well as those discussed above relative to health care  could negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
retention of key personnel our success is dependent on our key employees 
we must continue to attract  retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel including the replacement of senior management upon retirement 
individuals of this caliber could be in short supply and this shortage may limit our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  and thus  may hinder our ability to operate effectively 
changes in laws or regulations or failure to comply we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and licensing requirements which regulate health and sanitation standards  food labeling and handling  the sale of alcoholic beverages  employment practices  working conditions  citizenship requirements and public accommodations 
changes to such laws or regulations may adversely affect our profitability by increasing our costs or affecting the sale of certain items 
in addition  we must comply with state and local fire  zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect the costs and the operation of our existing stores or could delay or prevent the opening of a new store 
changes in accounting standards  policies and practices the issuance of new pronouncements or changes to existing accounting policies and practices could have a significant impact on our reported results or change the way we account for various transactions 
new policies and changes to existing rules may adversely affect our reported financial results 
availability and retention of retail space we currently lease the majority of our store locations 
typically  our supermarket leases have initial twenty year lease terms and may include options for up to an additional twenty years 
the average term remaining on our supermarket leases  including renewal options  is approximately sixteen years 
our revenues and profitability could be negatively impacted if we are unable to renew any of these leases at reasonable rates 
our continued growth depends to a significant degree on our ability to open or acquire new stores in existing and new trade areas and to operate these stores successfully 
our expansion strategy is dependent on finding suitable locations  and we face intense competition from other retailers for such sites 
we may not be able to find suitable locations that meet our demographic and operational requirements at a reasonable cost 
the most recent opening of a gelson s store occurred in september when the company opened its location in pasadena  california 
the ability of our vendors to supply products and services in a timely manner our business is dependent on our ability to purchase products from a large wholesaler and numerous smaller vendors in a timely manner and at competitive prices 
the largest supplier for our stores is unified  a grocery wholesale cooperative  which has provided product for our stores for approximately years 
we currently procure approximately of our product from unified 
any disruption in the business of unified or any of our other principal suppliers could negatively impact our sales and profitability on a short term basis 
even where we have access to alternative sources of supply  the failure of a major supplier to fulfill our orders could temporarily disrupt store level merchandise selection 
ability to control insurance coverage costs and claims experience we use a combination of insurance and self insurance plans to provide for coverage associated with losses related to workers compensation  general and auto liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  fiduciary  employment practices liability  business interruption  crime  earthquake and health care 
if insurance costs increase  it could have a negative impact on our profitability if we are not able to offset the effect of such increases with plan modifications  cost control measures  sales increases or by improving our operating efficiency 
we are self insured for general and auto liability and  in some prior years  we were self insured for workers compensation as well 
we have stop loss insurance coverage on each of these self insured plans to limit our exposure on a per claim basis and are insured for covered costs in excess of per claim limits 
the company devotes substantial time and effort to maintaining a safe environment in our stores  warehouse and offices 
however  the cost of both insured and self insured plans is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of premiums and our ability to manage claims 
the outcome of current and future legal proceedings from time to time we are the subject of complaints or litigation from customers alleging injury  food quality or operational concerns 
we may be adversely affected by publicity resulting from such allegations  regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable 
we are also subject to complaints or allegations from former or current employees  claims concerning hazardous substances on our current or previously owned or leased properties  class action suits concerning warning labels and other claims 
a lawsuit or claim could result in a decision against us that could have an adverse effect on our business if not covered by insurance 
additionally  the cost of defending ourselves against lawsuits and claims  regardless of merit  could have a negative impact on our profitability 
information technology systems our business is increasingly dependent on information technology systems that are complex and critical to continuing operations 
if we were to experience difficulties maintaining existing systems or implementing new systems  we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our operations 
through our sales and marketing activities  we collect and store some personal information that our customers provide to us 
we also gather and retain information about our associates in the normal course of business 
under certain circumstances  we may share information with vendors that assist us in conducting our business  with third parties as required by law  and or with third parties with the permission of the individual 
although we have implemented procedures to protect that information  we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to penetration 
computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our or our vendors network security and  if successful  misappropriate confidential customer or business information 
in addition  an employee  contractor  or other third party with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain information or inadvertently cause a breach involving the information 
loss of customer or business information could disrupt our operations  damage our reputation  and expose us to claims from customers  financial institutions  regulatory authorities  payment card associations  associates  and other persons  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  compliance with tougher privacy and information security laws and standards may result in additional expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes 
impact of local projects in the vicinity of our supermarkets from time to time  local events or projects take place in the vicinity of our stores that may have a negative impact on our sales and profitability 
stock price volatility the market price of our class a common stock class a could be subject to significant fluctuation in response to various market factors and events including general economic and market conditions  variations in our earnings or other financial results  publicity regarding the company or its competitors and the grocery business in general 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have sometimes been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
furthermore  there is not a significant volume of trading in our class a which subjects our stock price to a higher level of volatility and may adversely impact the liquidity of the stock 
fluctuations in our class a price also impact compensation expense as it relates to our outstanding stock appreciation rights sars

overview arden is a holding company which conducts operations through its first and second tier wholly owned subsidiaries  arden mayfair and gelson s  respectively  as well as owning and managing its own real estate through mayfair realty which is owned by the company and arden mayfair 
as of december   gelson s operated eighteen full service supermarkets in southern california 
as described below  on february   the gelson s store in northridge was closed 
gelson s caters to those customers who expect superior quality  service and merchandise selection 
in addition to the customary supermarket offerings  gelson s offers specialty items such as imported foods  unusual delicatessen items  prepared foods and organic and natural food products 
gelson s stores include the typical service departments such as meat  seafood  service deli  floral  sushi  cheese and bakery 
in addition  some stores offer further services including fresh pizza  coffee bars  self service hot and cold food cases  gelato bars and carving carts offering cooked poultry and meats 
the company s management focuses on a number of performance indicators in evaluating financial condition and results of operations 
same store sales  gross profit and labor costs are some of the key factors that management considers 
both sales and gross profit are significantly influenced by competition in our trade area 
gelson s faces competition from regional and national supermarket chains most of which have greater resources and a larger market share than gelson s  stores specializing in natural and organic foods  specialty and gourmet markets and grocery departments in mass merchandise and club stores 
weak economic conditions have led to even greater competition in the grocery industry 
as discretionary income has declined  some consumers have reduced their spending and are making more price conscious decisions which has caused us to compete for fewer customer dollars and has forced us to lower some of our retail prices and offer more promotional discounts as our competitors have also reduced their prices in an attempt to maintain or increase their own market share 
labor and other related payroll costs are the second largest expense after product cost incurred by gelson s  and thus is a financial measure which is monitored by management 
as of the fiscal year end  gelson s had approximately  full time and part time store  warehouse and office employees 
the majority of gelson s employees are members of the ufcw 
gelson s previous contract with the ufcw expired on march  prior to the expiration of the previous contract  gelson s signed an extension agreement with the ufcw and agreed to be bound by all modifications regarding trust funds and increases in hourly wage rates as negotiated between the ufcw and the majors 
in late september  employees of the majors ratified a new labor contract 
employees of gelson s who are members of the ufcw ratified a new labor contract with gelson s on terms similar to those reached by the majors in a vote held on october  the new labor contract which expires on march  provides for bonuses in lieu of wage increases within days following ratification and again in march for employees at certain experience levels 
the contract also provides for wage increases for certain classes of employees in march the agreement that the majors reached with the ufcw in provided for hourly wage rates based on job classification and experience that  in some cases  were less than those agreed to by gelson s 
since gelson s agreed to increase hourly wage rates by the same amount as the majors in the recent negotiations  gelson s continues to pay higher hourly wages rates for some job classifications and experience levels 
in addition  certain of the company s warehouse and office employees are members of the international brotherhood of teamsters teamsters union 
the company s contract with the teamsters union was renewed in for a five year period expiring september  on terms similar to those reached by the major retailers and wholesaler in our trade area 
the company contributes to multi employer health care and pension plan trusts on behalf of its employees who are members of the ufcw 
all employers who participate in the ufcw multi employer plans are required to contribute at the same hourly rate based on straight time hours worked in order to fund the plans 
the company s health and welfare contribution rate increased effective the beginning of march  february and september in accordance with the ufcw collective bargaining agreement 
as a result  average weekly health and welfare expense increased on these dates by approximately   and  respectively 
an additional health and welfare increase of approximately  to  per week became effective at the beginning of march and a similar increase will be effective at the beginning of march one time surcharges of approximately   and  are also due in march  march and february  respectively 
with respect to the pension plan  the company has not been subject to a change in the pension contribution rate in recent years  however  a rate change became effective january and is expected to cost the company approximately  more per week 
the increase in health and welfare and pension costs  as well as the labor cost issue discussed above  has negatively impacted the company s profitability and will continue to unless the company is able to offset the increased expense through a combination of sales growth  increased gross margin  reduced labor hours and cost savings in other areas 
in addition  the most recently available certified zone status provided by the pension plan trust indicates that the pension plan was in critical status less than percent funded as defined by the pension protection act of for the year ended march  a rehabilitation plan has been implemented by the plan trustee which includes a schedule of benefit cuts and contribution rate increases that allows for projected emergence from critical status at the end of the rehabilitation period on march  however  if the funded status of the plan deteriorates or if the rehabilitation plan is unsuccessful or if any of the participating employers in the plan withdraws from the plan due to insolvency and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to cover the underfunded liabilities associated with its participants  the company may be required to make additional contributions which could also negatively impact the company s financial condition and results of operations 
another component of labor related expense is the cost of workers compensation 
for some years prior to july   the company is primarily self insured through the use of a high deductible policy which provides the company with stop loss coverage to limit its exposure on a per claim basis and provides coverage for qualifying costs in excess of per claim limits 
since july   the company has purchased fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance to replace the high deductible program 
the guaranteed cost program eliminates the company s risk against claims occurring after june  and has resulted in lower workers compensation expense compared to the high deductible program 
the company continues to maintain an accrual for workers compensation claims incurred prior to july under the high deductible program 
that accrual is based on both undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the company devotes substantial time and commitment to maintaining a safe work environment  the ultimate cost of workers compensation is highly dependent upon legal and legislative trends  the inflation rate of health care costs and the company s ability to manage claims 
in the past  the company s quarterly results have reflected significant fluctuations in operating income as a result of adjustments recorded to reflect the change in the fair value of sars that have been granted to non employee directors and certain employees 
each sar entitles the holder to receive cash upon exercise equal to the excess of the fair market value of a share of the company s class a  as determined in accordance with the sars agreement  on the date of exercise over the fair market value of such share on the date granted 
fluctuations in the market price of the company s class a from the end of the previous fiscal year impact the recognition or reversal of sars compensation expense in the year being reported upon 
since the company cannot predict future fluctuations in the market price of its stock  it also cannot forecast future sars compensation expense adjustments and the extent to which operating income will be impacted 
gelson s closed its store located in northridge  california after the close of business on february  gelson s decision to close the store was based on the lack of profitability of the northridge location for the past several years 
effective march   gelson s reached an agreement with the landlord and a third party to assign the lease 
subject to compliance with certain closing conditions  gelson s rent and all other obligations under the lease agreement will end effective no later than may  in accordance with the assignment of the lease  various items of equipment will be transferred by gelson s to the assignee and gelson s agreed to pay the assignee a lease assignment fee of  in addition  gelson s expects to incur closing costs estimated to be between  and  to transfer excess product and supplies to other gelson s locations  to write off product which cannot be transferred  to shut down and relocate or write off equipment  to terminate current subtenant leases and to maintain the store until gelson s has no further obligations under the lease 
these costs will be recorded as incurred 
all currently active employees at the northridge location have been offered employment at other gelson s locations 
results of operations compared to sales from the company s eighteen supermarkets all of which are located in southern california  including revenue from licensing arrangements  subleases  leases and finance charges  were  in this represents an increase of from  when sales were  sales were positively impacted by inflation as well as an increase in the number of transactions in compared to increased sales reflect improvement in the economic environment in our local trade areas despite intense competition and cautious consumer purchasing behavior

self insurance reserves the company is primarily self insured for losses related to general and auto liability claims and for all open years prior to july  for workers compensation 
the company maintains stop loss insurance coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis 
effective july   the company purchased a fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance policy for losses occurring after june  this policy replaced the high deductible program for workers compensation 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the company under the high deductible programs are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience and regression analysis 
accruals are based on undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
while the ultimate amount of claims incurred is dependent on future developments  in management s opinion recorded reserves are adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
the company s liability reserve for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims at december  was approximately  employment agreement bernard briskin  chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer of the company has an employment agreement with the company that provides for annual retirement compensation for the remainder of his lifetime equal to of his average base salary and bonus earned in the last three fiscal years prior to his retirement

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management has established accounting policies that they believe are appropriate in order to reflect the accurate reporting of the company s operating results  financial position and cash flows 
the company applies these accounting policies in a consistent manner 
management bases their estimates on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  and therefore actual results may differ from estimates 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
inventories and cost of sales supermarket nonperishable inventories are recorded using the retail method and are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the last in  first out lifo method 
perishable inventories are valued at the lower of cost on a first in  first out fifo basis or market 
under the retail inventory method  cost of sales is determined by applying a cost to retail ratio to sales for the period to determine cost of sales 
cost of sales is then deducted from beginning inventory plus purchases to arrive at ending inventory 
the company performs physical inventories of nonperishable items at all of its locations three times per year  at which time ending inventory and cost of sales are adjusted to reflect actual inventory on hand and cost of sales 
physical inventories of perishable products are conducted at the end of each fiscal month 
approximately and of the company s inventories were valued using the lifo method as of december  and january   respectively 
the lifo method assumes that the cost of the most recently purchased items are the first to be sold  and thus  are used to measure cost of sales  leaving the earlier costs residing in the ending inventory valuation 
the company uses the link chain  dollar value method for purposes of calculating its lifo charge or credit each year for nonperishable inventories 
this method requires management to compute a cumulative price index which represents the change in inventory cost since the base year ie  the beginning of the year in which lifo was first elected compared to the current cost of inventory 
the cumulative index is then applied to the current cost of inventory to determine the value of inventory at base year costs 
this computation is performed separately for each of the company s individual lifo pools ie  groupings of similar items such as basic grocery  housewares  alcoholic beverages  etc the lifo method requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory mix and factors related to the computation of price indices which could impact the ending inventory valuation as well as cost of sales 
if the fifo method had been used for nonperishable inventories instead of the lifo method  total inventory as of december  and january  would have been higher by approximately  and  respectively 
the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts at its stores and warehouse 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages from the last physical count to the financial statement date 
although the company has sufficient historical data to record reasonable estimates of inventory shortages  actual results could differ 
as of december   a difference between actual and estimated shortages of  for example  basis points would have an annual impact of approximately  on cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is recognized when estimated future cash flows undiscounted and before interest charges are less than carrying value 
the factor that most significantly affects the impairment calculation is management s estimate of future cash flows which is inherently uncertain and relies on various assumptions regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
the company s cash flow projection looks several years into the future and includes assumptions such as the rate of inflation deflation  the strength of the economy  competition in our trade area  the ability to secure subtenants and the company s ability to negotiate early termination agreements 
if impairment analysis assumptions change  then an adjustment to the carrying value of the company s long lived assets could occur 
to the extent that an asset is impaired  the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against earnings 
no asset impairment charges or adjustments were recognized during fiscal  or workers compensation and general and auto liability insurance the company is primarily self insured i for losses for all years related to general and auto liability claims and ii for some years prior to july  for workers compensation 
where primarily self insured  the company purchases stop loss insurance coverage to limit its loss exposure on a per claim basis 
related accruals are based on undeveloped reported claims and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the amount of reserves for reported claims are determined by a third party administrator claims representative who considers the individual facts of each claim including severity in arriving at an estimate of the company s total exposure 
in addition  the company analyzes its historical paid and incurred loss trends in order to further develop an estimate of its ultimate cost of undeveloped reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates and historical trends are not an absolute indication of future results  and the company reevaluates these reserves quarterly based on the most current information available 
the ultimate cost of claims are impacted by numerous variables including the frequency and severity of claims  legal and legislative trends  changes in benefit levels  the rate of inflation and claim settlement patterns 
since july   the company has purchased fully insured guaranteed cost workers compensation insurance thereby limiting its exposure for workers compensation to the cost of the related insurance premium 
the company s self insured workers compensation accrual for claims incurred prior to july decreased from  at the beginning of fiscal to  at the end of the year as a result of payments of  which amount was partially offset by reserve adjustments of  the company expects the workers compensation reserve to continue to decline as it continues to pay down and close outstanding workers compensation claims which occurred prior to july  the company s reserves for general and auto liability claims increased by approximately  during fiscal the net increase reflects a net accrual  including reserve adjustments of  partially offset by payments of  vendor allowances the company receives a variety of allowances from its vendors whose products are sold in gelson s stores 
typically  the vendors are paying the company to promote their products 
the promotion may be a temporary price reduction  a feature in a print advertisement or newsletter  placement of the vendor s product in a preferred location in a store or introduction of a new product 
the promotions range from approximately two weeks to six months and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales as they are earned 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount and timing of recognition of vendor allowances as a reduction of cost of sales  as well as the amount of vendor funds remaining in ending inventory  requires management judgment and estimates 
management estimates current year purchase volume based on projected and historical data 
in turn  the estimated purchase volume is used to determine the amount of vendor allowances to recognize each period 
the company does not expect that there will be a significant change in the annual level of vendor support  however  a one percent change in total vendor funds earned would likewise impact gross profit by approximately 
as a percent of sales 
stock appreciation rights outstanding sars are revalued at the end of each quarter using the black scholes option pricing model which incorporates various highly subjective assumptions  including expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and a risk free interest rate 
the fair value of sars  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model  does not necessarily reflect the amount that will be paid out in accordance with the sars agreement on the date of exercise 
in addition  changes in the market price of the company s class a can and have significantly impacted the recognition or reversal of sars expense 
recent accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
this pronouncement was issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level three fair value measurements 
this pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have any impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued asu  compensation retirement benefits multiemployer plans subtopic 
asu provides guidance on disclosure requirements for employers participating in multiemployer pension and other postretirement benefit plans to improve transparency and increase awareness of the commitments and risks involved with participation in multiemployer plans 
the new guidance requires employers participating in multiemployer plans to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures to provide users with more detailed information regarding an employer s involvement in multiemployer plans 
the new guidance was effective for the company s fiscal year ended december  the adoption of asu did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
the amendments in asu defer the changes in asu  presentation of comprehensive income that relate to the presentation of reclassifications from other comprehensive income to net income 
the company early adopted asu using the single statement approach in the second quarter of on a retrospective basis for all periods presented 
the adoption of asu had no impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company currently has no outstanding bank debt or fixture financing 
if the company should borrow in the future  the company could then be exposed to market risk related to interest fluctuations 
a change in market prices exposes the company to market risk related to its investments 
as of december   all investments were classified as available for sale securities and totaled  a hypothetical drop in the market value of these investments would result in a  unrealized loss and a corresponding decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
this hypothetical drop would not affect cash flow and would not have an impact on earnings until the company sold the investments
