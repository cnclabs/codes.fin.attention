forward looking statements the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes contained in this report 
all comparisons in the discussion are to the corresponding prior year unless otherwise stated 
all amounts presented are in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  except as noted 
all amounts are presented in millions of dollars  except for share data  unless otherwise indicated 
captions such as income from continuing operations attributable to air products  net income attributable to air products  and diluted earnings per share attributable to air products are simply referred to as income from continuing operations  net income  and diluted earnings per share throughout this management s discussion and analysis  unless otherwise stated 
the discussion of results that follows includes comparisons to non gaap financial measures 
in  the non gaap measures exclude the photovoltaic pv market actions charge  the polyurethane intermediates pui business actions charge  the cost reduction plan charge  the customer bankruptcy charge  the gain on the previously held equity interest in dupont air products nanomaterials llc da nanomaterials  the spanish tax settlement  and the spanish tax ruling 
these non gaap measures exclude the net loss on airgas transaction in and the presentation of non gaap measures is intended to enhance the usefulness of financial information by providing measures that our management uses internally to evaluate our baseline performance on a comparable basis 
the reconciliation of reported gaap results to non gaap measures is presented on pages business overview air products and chemicals  inc and its subsidiaries serve energy  electronics  chemicals  steel  and manufacturing customers globally with a unique portfolio of products  services  and solutions that include atmospheric  process and specialty gases  performance materials  equipment  and technology 
geographically diverse  with operations in over countries  we have sales of billion  assets of billion  and a worldwide workforce of approximately  employees 
we organize our operations into four reportable business segments merchant gases  tonnage gases  electronics and performance materials  and equipment and energy 
in summary in  the global economy proved to be more challenging than we expected and we did not see the anticipated economic growth we forecasted for the second half of the fiscal year 
global manufacturing grew approximately for the year and limited the opportunities for growth  particularly in our merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments 
underlying volume growth was modest  and overall  sales declined by resulting from a stronger dollar and lower energy cost pass through partially offset by acquisitions 
our operating income declined versus the prior year 
in response to the current and forecasted economic environment  we took a number of important steps to position our global portfolio for future success 
in europe  we sold our homecare business and implemented a restructuring program to better align our cost structure with the slower economy 
we took actions to exit our polyurethane intermediates business and restructured our photovoltaic business to reflect current market conditions 
additionally  we executed on acquisition opportunities to support our growth strategies 
in the merchant segment  we acquired a controlling stake in indura sa  the largest independent gas company in latin america 
we also purchased a position in abdullah hashim industrial gases equipment co 
ltd 
ahg  the largest industrial gas company in saudi arabia 
finally  in electronics  we purchased the remaining share of our da nanomaterials joint venture 
highlights for sales of  decreased  or  as unfavorable currency and lower energy raw material contractual cost pass through to customers were partially offset by higher volumes and acquisitions 
operating income of  decreased  or on a non gaap basis  operating income of  decreased  or  with positive impacts from new plants onstream in the tonnage segment offset by weaker merchant  electronics and performance materials and equipment volumes 
unfavorable impacts from a stronger dollar were partially offset by cost productivity  improved pricing  and the impact of acquisitions 
income from continuing operations of decreased  or  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of decreased  or 
on a non gaap basis  income from continuing operations of  decreased  or  and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of increased  or 
a summary table of changes in diluted earnings per share is presented below 
capital spending was  for the year ended september on a non gaap basis  capital spending of  increased  primarily from the acquisition of indura s 
a and the construction of new plants under contract with customers  primarily in the tonnage gases segment 
we purchased 
million of our outstanding shares at a cost of under the  share repurchase program announced in the fourth quarter of at september  in share repurchase authorization remains 
we increased our quarterly dividend from 
to 
per share 
this represents the th consecutive year that we have increased our dividend payment

we expect that the us will continue to grow between 
we do not anticipate any meaningful growth in europe in the near future 
in asia  we expect below trend growth from as exports to other regions are slow 
in south america  we expect growth of 
we anticipate higher earnings in from new plant onstreams and from the loading of existing assets but recognize that this factor will be most influenced by the economy 
we also anticipate higher earnings from our acquisition of indura sa these gains will be partially offset by higher pension expense as a result of a decline in interest rates 
we also expect lower earnings in as a result of restructuring our pui business  unfavorable currency impacts  and a higher effective tax rate 
we are focused on increasing productivity and managing costs in this challenging economic environment 
the cost reduction actions implemented in should provide benefits in and beyond 
outlook by segment in merchant gases  volume growth will continue to be influenced by the economy 
we have available capacity in each region and will continue to utilize new applications to drive growth 
we expect the business to benefit from the cost reduction actions in europe 
results should also benefit from the acquisition of indura sa tonnage gases is expected to benefit from new plant onstreams in and these plants are supported by long term take or pay contracts 
we are hopeful that electronics growth will begin to rebound in following a weak overall  we expect silicon growth of in for performance materials  we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter of with volume growth limited until economic activity increases 
equipment and energy results are expected to improve due to higher activity in our lng equipment business

financing and capital structure capital needs in were satisfied primarily with cash from operations  the sale of our european homecare business  and the issuance of long term debt 
at the end of  total debt outstanding was  compared to  and cash and cash items were compared to total debt at september and  expressed as a percentage of the sum of total debt and total equity  was and  respectively 
proceeds from long term debt were this included the issuance of a senior fixed rate note on november that matures on november  which was used for general corporate purposes 
additionally  a senior fixed rate note on september that matures on october was issued primarily to refinance commercial paper associated with the indura sa business combination 
refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
an acquisition financing facility was arranged with banco santander  chile to provide the initial financing required for the indura sa business combination 
this was a chilean peso clp committed credit facility with a total commitment amount of clp billion 
of this facility  clp billion was drawn on july to fund the business combination and related expenses  and the balance of the commitment was cancelled 
this facility was fully repaid on august  primarily with proceeds from us commercial paper issuance 
a portion of this commercial paper was subsequently refinanced with the senior fixed rate note described above 
as of september  a eurobond for maturing in was classified as long term debt because of our ability to refinance the debt under our  committed credit facility maturing in and our intent to refinance via the us or european public or private placement markets 
during the first quarter of  we reclassified this eurobond from long term debt to current portion of long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as we no longer intended to refinance it 
the eurobond was repaid on its maturity date of april  principally from proceeds of commercial paper issuance 
during fiscal year  we increased our total multicurrency facility to a total of  maturing on june our only financial covenant is a leverage ratio long term debt divided by the sum of long term debt plus equity of no greater than 
as of september  no borrowings were outstanding under these commitments 
effective june  we entered into an offshore chinese renminbi rmb syndicated credit facility of rmb  million  maturing in june there are rmb million in outstanding borrowings under this commitment at september additional commitments totaling are maintained by our foreign subsidiaries  of which was borrowed and outstanding at september we are in compliance with all of the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements 
we have classified a senior note for maturing in as long term debt because we have the ability to refinance the debt under our  committed credit facility maturing in our current intent is to refinance this debt via the us public or private placement markets 
on september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our outstanding common stock 
during fiscal year  
million of our outstanding shares were purchased at a cost of at september  in share repurchase authorization remains 
outlook cash flows from operations and financing activities are expected to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we project a modest need to access the long term debt markets in  primarily driven by debt maturities 
we expect that we will continue to be in compliance with all of our financial covenants 
also  we anticipate that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper and other short term debt markets 
dividends on march  the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend from 
per share to 
per share 
dividends are declared by the board of directors and are usually paid during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter 
contractual obligations we are obligated to make future payments under various contracts  such as debt agreements  lease agreements  unconditional purchase obligations  and other long term obligations 
the following table summarizes our obligations as of september payments due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital leases operating leases pension obligations unconditional purchase obligations other liabilities total contractual obligations long term debt obligations the long term debt obligations include the maturity payments of long term debt  including current portion  and the related contractual interest obligations 
refer to note  debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long term debt 
contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on the long term debt obligations without taking into account the interest impact of interest rate swaps related to any of this debt  which at current interest rates would slightly decrease contractual interest 
we had  of long term debt subject to variable interest rates at september  excluding fixed rate debt that has been swapped to variable rate debt 
the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at september variable interest rates are primarily determined by interbank offer rates and by us short term tax exempt interest rates 
leases refer to note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on capital and operating leases 
pension obligations the amounts in the table above represent the current estimated cash payments to be made by us that in total equal the recognized pension liabilities 
refer to note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements 
these payments are based upon the current valuation assumptions and regulatory environment 
the total accrued liability for pension benefits is impacted by interest rates  plan demographics  actual return on plan assets  continuation or modification of benefits  and other factors 
such factors can significantly impact the amount of the liability and related contributions 
unconditional purchase obligations approximately of our long term unconditional purchase obligations relate to feedstock supply for numerous hyco hydrogen  carbon monoxide  and syngas facilities 
the price of feedstock supply is principally related to the price of natural gas 
however  long term take or pay sales contracts to hyco customers are generally matched to the term of the feedstock supply obligations and provide recovery of price increases in the feedstock supply 
due to the matching of most long term feedstock supply obligations to customer sales contracts  we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the unconditional purchase obligations also include other product supply and purchase commitments and electric power and natural gas supply purchase obligations  which are primarily pass through contracts with our customers 
we have a supply agreement for the purchase of silane gas that is not matched to a customer sales contract having terms extending to ten years 
in the fourth quarter of  we made an offer to terminate the contract  however  no settlement has been reached 
refer to note  business restructuring and cost reduction plans  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in addition  purchase commitments to spend approximately for additional plant and equipment are included in the unconditional purchase obligations in we also purchase materials  energy  capital equipment  supplies  and services as part of the ordinary course of business under arrangements that are not unconditional purchase obligations 
the majority of such purchases are for raw materials and energy  which are obtained under requirements type contracts at market prices 
in total  we purchase approximately billion annually  including the unconditional purchase obligations in the table above 
other liabilities we have an obligation to purchase of the remaining shares of indura sa within twelve months of the acquisition date for clp billion based on a multiple of earnings formula  which is reflected in other liabilities at september this liability was reported in payables and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of september refer to note  business combinations  and note  supplemental information  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
income tax liabilities noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities as of september were refer to note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
tax liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits as of september were these tax liabilities were not included in the contractual obligations table  as it is impractical to determine a cash impact by year 
discontinued operations other noncurrent liabilities as of september included for the contingent proceeds related to the sale of our homecare business 
refer to note  discontinued operations  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table due to the uncertainty in timing of any payments 
put options we currently have outstanding put option agreements with other shareholders of our air products san fu company  ltd 
and indura sa subsidiaries 
the put options give the shareholders the right to sell stock in the subsidiaries based on pricing terms in the agreements 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
due to the uncertainty of whether these options would be exercised and the related timing  we excluded the potential payments from the contractual obligations table 
pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees 
the principal defined benefit pension plans the us salaried pension plan and the us pension plan were closed to new participants in and were replaced with defined contribution plans 
over the long run  the shift to defined contribution plans is expected to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions 
for  the fair market value of pension plan assets for our defined benefit plans as of the measurement date increased to  from  in the projected benefit obligation for these plans as of the measurement date was  and  in and  respectively 
refer to note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements for comprehensive and detailed disclosures on our postretirement benefits 
pension expense pension expense special terminations  settlements  and curtailments included above weighted average discount rate weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets weighted average expected rate of compensation increase vs 
pension expense in  net of special items  was comparable to expense as a result of no change in the weighted average discount rate from year to year 
vs 
the increase in pension expense  net of special items  was primarily attributable to the bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate  resulting in higher amortization of actuarial losses 
the increase was partially offset by a higher expected return on plan assets resulting from large contributions in expense in included of special termination and settlement charges 
outlook pension expense is estimated to be approximately to in  an increase of to from  resulting primarily from a decline in discount rates 
in  pension expense will include approximately for amortization of actuarial losses compared to in net actuarial losses of were incurred in  resulting primarily from a bp decrease in the weighted average discount rate  partially offset by actual asset returns above expected returns 
actuarial gains losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses 
future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets  different from expected returns  would impact the actuarial gains losses and resulting amortization in years beyond pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans 
with respect to funded plans  our funding policy is that contributions  combined with appreciation and earnings  will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses 
in addition  we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions 
we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan  which help guide the level of contributions 
during and  our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were and  respectively 
cash contributions to defined benefit plans  including benefit payments for unfunded plans  are estimated to be approximately in actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation  discount rates  investment performance  plan design  and various other factors 
refer to the contractual obligations discussion on page for a projection of future contributions 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we have operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations results in higher capital expenditures and costs 
from time to time  we are involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act the federal superfund law  similar state laws  and the resource conservation and recovery act rcra relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation and possible cleanup 
our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the amounts charged to income from continuing operations related to environmental matters totaled   and in   and  respectively 
these amounts represent an estimate of expenses for compliance with environmental laws  remedial activities  and activities undertaken to meet internal company standards 
future costs are not expected to be materially different from these amounts 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
although precise amounts are difficult to determine  we estimate that in and  we spent approximately and  respectively  on capital projects to control pollution 
capital expenditures to control pollution in future years are estimated to be approximately and in and  respectively 
we accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the potential exposure for such costs is estimated to range from to a reasonably possible upper exposure of the consolidated balance sheets at september and included an accrual of and  respectively 
the accrual for the environmental obligations relating to the pace  florida  piedmont  south carolina  paulsboro  new jersey  and the pasadena  texas locations is included in these amounts 
refer to note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for further details on these facilities 
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
subject to the imprecision in estimating future environmental costs  we do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year 
some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have  or are developing regulations governing emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
these include existing and expanding coverage under the european union emissions trading scheme  mandatory reporting and reductions at manufacturing facilities in alberta  canada  and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on ghg emissions in ontario  canada and south korea 
in addition  the us environmental protection agency is regulating ghg emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities 
at the us state level  california s cap and trade program rules have been officially adopted  and our compliance obligation as a hydrogen producer is set to begin january we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the costs through our contractual terms 
increased public awareness and concern may result in more international  us federal  and or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of ghg 
although uncertain  these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power  hydrogen production  and fluorinated gases production 
we believe we will be able to mitigate some of the potential costs through our contractual terms  but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements in some of the jurisdictions where we operate prevents accurate prediction of the long term impact on us 
any legislation that limits or taxes ghg emissions from our facilities could impact our growth by increasing our operating costs or reducing demand for certain of our products 
regulation of ghg may also produce new opportunities for us 
we continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption  improve efficiency  and lower emissions 
we are also developing a portfolio of technologies that capture carbon dioxide from power and chemical plants before it reaches the atmosphere  enable cleaner transportation fuels  and facilitate alternate fuel source development 
in addition  the potential demand for clean coal and our carbon capture solutions could increase demand for oxygen  one of our main products  and our proprietary technology for delivering low cost oxygen 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain guarantee agreements as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
we are not a primary beneficiary in any material variable interest entity 
we do not have any derivative instruments indexed to our own stock 
our off balance sheet arrangements are not reasonably likely to have a material impact on financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
related party transactions our principal related parties are equity affiliates operating primarily in the industrial gas business 
we did not engage in any material transactions involving related parties that included terms or other aspects that differ from those which would be negotiated at arm s length with clearly independent parties 
inflation the consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with us gaap and do not fully reflect the impact of prior years inflation 
while some inflationary pressures existed during the first half of fiscal year  inflation in the us has been modest for several years 
in addition  we operate in many countries that experience volatility in inflation and foreign exchange rates  with inflationary pressures that differ from those in the us the ability to pass on inflationary cost increases is an uncertainty due to general economic conditions and competitive situations 
it is estimated that the cost of replacing our plant and equipment today is greater than its historical cost 
accordingly  depreciation expense would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes our major accounting policies 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
however  application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires management s significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 
depreciable lives of plant and equipment net plant and equipment at september totaled  and depreciation expense totaled during plant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method  which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life 
economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
assumptions on the following factors  among others  affect the determination of estimated economic useful life wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  market demand  competitive position  raw material availability  and geographic location 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technology  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
we have numerous long term customer supply contracts  particularly in the gases on site business within the tonnage gases segment 
these contracts principally have initial contract terms of to years 
there are also long term customer supply contracts associated with the tonnage gases business within the electronics and performance materials segment 
these contracts principally have initial terms of to years 
additionally  we have several customer supply contracts within the equipment and energy segment with contract terms that are primarily to years 
the depreciable lives of assets within this segment can be extended to years for certain redeployable assets 
depreciable lives of the production assets related to long term contracts are matched to the contract lives 
extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term 
as contract terms are extended  the depreciable life of the remaining net book value of the production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term  as long as it does not exceed the economic life of the asset 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the merchant gases segment are principally years 
customer contracts associated with products produced at these types of facilities typically have a much shorter term 
the depreciable lives of production facilities within the electronics and performance materials segment  where there is not an associated long term supply agreement  range from to years 
these depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances  potential obsolescence  competitors actions  etc 
management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change 
a change in the depreciable life by one year for production facilities within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments for which there is not an associated long term customer supply agreement would impact annual depreciation expense as summarized below decrease life by year increase life by year merchant gases electronics and performance materials impairment of long lived assets plant and equipment plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include a significant decrease in the market value of a long lived asset grouping  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition  a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping  or changes in the expected useful life of the long lived assets 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset group is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group s fair value and its carrying value 
an estimate of the asset group s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce  inflation  etc 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
goodwill the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations currently requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of an acquired entity 
goodwill  including goodwill associated with equity affiliates of  was  as of september the majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within the merchant gases and electronics and performance materials segments 
goodwill increased in primarily as a result of the indura sa acquisition in merchant gases 
disclosures related to goodwill are included in note  goodwill and intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements 
we perform an impairment test annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
in addition  goodwill would be tested more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicated that potential impairment exists 
the impairment test requires that we compare the fair value of business reporting units to carrying value  including assigned goodwill 
we have designated our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing as one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly 
currently  we have four business segments and thirteen reporting units 
reporting units are primarily based on products and geographic locations within each business segment 
in the fourth quarter of  we conducted the required annual test of goodwill for impairment 
we determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded its carrying value  and therefore there were no indications of impairment 
we primarily use an income approach valuation model  representing the present value of future cash flows  to determine fair value of a reporting unit 
our valuation model uses a five year growth period for the business and an estimated exit trading multiple 
management has determined the income approach valuation model represents the most appropriate valuation methodology due to the capital intensive nature of the business  long term contractual nature of the business  relatively consistent cash flows generated by our reporting units  and limited comparables within the industry 
the principal assumptions utilized in our income approach valuation model include revenue growth rate  operating profit margins  discount rate  and exit multiple 
revenue growth rate and operating profit assumptions are consistent with those utilized in our operating plan and long term financial planning process 
the discount rate assumption is calculated based upon an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  cost of debt  and expected equity premiums 
the exit multiple is determined from comparable industry transactions 
also  the expected cash flows consider the customer attrition rate assumption  which is based on historical experience and current and future expected market conditions 
management judgment is required in the determination of each assumption utilized in the valuation model  and actual results could differ from the estimates 
intangible assets intangible assets with determinable lives at september totaled and consisted primarily of customer relationships as well as purchased patents and technology 
these intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long lived asset grouping impairment tests 
impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
see impairment discussion above under plant and equipment for a description of how impairment losses are determined 
indefinite lived intangible assets at september totaled and consisted primarily of trade names and trademarks 
indefinite lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually 
in addition  these intangible assets are tested more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists 
to determine fair value  we utilize an income approach  the royalty savings method 
this method values an intangible asset by estimating the royalties saved through ownership of the asset 
equity investments investments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled  at september the majority of our investments are non publicly traded ventures with other companies in the industrial gas business 
summarized financial information of equity affiliates is included in note  summarized financial information of equity affiliates  to the consolidated financial statements 
equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable 
in the event that a decline in fair value of an investment occurs  and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an impairment loss would be recognized 
management s estimate of fair value of an investment is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee 
changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using the enacted tax rate 
at september  accrued income taxes and net deferred tax liabilities amounted to and  respectively 
tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of september were  excluding interest and penalties 
income tax expense for the year ended september was disclosures related to income taxes are included in note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements 
management judgment is required in determining income tax expense and the related balance sheet amounts 
judgments are required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates  depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
we believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments 
deferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when there are not sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards  these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the income tax expense 
a point increase decrease in our effective tax rate would decrease increase net income by approximately pension benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under the defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions and expense associated with the defined benefit plans 
actuarial models are used in calculating the pension expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans 
these models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis  therefore  the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans 
we determine assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the rate of compensation increase 
note  retirement benefits  to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted average basis for both the domestic and international plans 
the actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality  and turnover rates 
we believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and different rates of retirement  mortality  and turnover 
one of the critical assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate 
this rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans 
the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments are matched against the returns of high quality corporate bonds over the same time period to determine an overall effective discount rate 
the rate is used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date 
this rate will change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense 
a bp increase decrease in the discount rate decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
the expected rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned by plan assets over the period that the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid 
the expected return on plan assets assumption is based on a weighted average of estimated long term returns of major asset classes and the historical performance of plan assets 
in determining asset class returns  we take into account historical long term returns  and the value of active management  as well as the interest rate environment 
asset allocation is determined based on long term return  volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes  the profiles of the plans liabilities and acceptable levels of risk 
lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense 
a bp increase decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets decreases increases pension expense by approximately per year 
we use a market related valuation method for recognizing investment gains or losses 
investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market related value of assets 
this method recognizes certain investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur  which reduces year to year volatility 
expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market related value of assets over the five year period 
the expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption 
we determine this rate based on review of the underlying long term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience  as well as comparison to peer companies 
a bp increase decrease in the expected rate of compensation increases decreases pension expense by approximately per year 
loss contingencies in the normal course of business we encounter contingencies  ie  situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on us 
we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
contingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters  for which our accounting policy is discussed in note  major accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  and particulars are provided in note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
significant judgment is required in both determining probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated 
these determinations are made based on the best available information at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies 
revisions in the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted 
for example  due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures  a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated  the scope of remediation is increased  or our proportionate share is increased 
similarly  a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings  cash flows  and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
it is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital 
we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass through contracts with customers and price increases 
in the past  we have also entered into a limited number of commodity swap contracts in order to reduce the cash flow exposure to changes in the price of natural gas relative to certain oil based feedstocks 
there were no commodity swap contracts outstanding at september and we address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions  thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
all instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
for details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and the major accounting policies  see note  major accounting policies  and note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information 
our derivative and other financial instruments consist of long term debt including current portion  interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange forward contracts 
the net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position and is disclosed in note  fair value measurements  to the consolidated financial statements 
at september and  the net financial instrument position was a liability of  and  respectively 
the increase in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the impact of a higher book value of long term debt excluding exchange rate impacts 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
the market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions interest rates  spot and forward exchange rates  and implied volatilities as of the valuation date 
interest rate risk our debt portfolio  including swap agreements  as of september primarily comprised debt denominated in us dollars and euros  including the effect of currency swaps 
this debt portfolio is composed of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable rate portions of our debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous bp move in interest rates from the level at september  with all other variables held constant 
a bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
a bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
based on the variable rate debt included in our debt portfolio  including the interest rate swap agreements  a bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional and of interest incurred per year at the end of september and  respectively 
a bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by and per year at september and  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at september and  with all other variables held constant 
a strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase  respectively  of and in the net liability position of financial instruments at september and  respectively 
the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro and the us dollar versus the pound sterling 
foreign currency debt  cross currency interest rate swaps  and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business  thereby reducing our net asset exposure 
foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis
