item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition  liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion of our international operations 

table of contents raw materials we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers  aluminum and plastic 
elastomers include both natural and synthetic materials 
we have access to adequate supplies of these raw materials to meet our production needs through agreements with suppliers 
we employ a supply chain management strategy in our business segments  which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply 
due to regulatory control over our production processes  and the cost and time involved in qualifying suppliers  we rely on single source suppliers for many critical raw materials 
this strategy increases the risk that our supply chain may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem 
these risks are managed  where possible  by selecting suppliers with multiple manufacturing sites  rigid quality control systems  surplus inventory levels and other methods of maintaining supply in case of an interruption in production and  therefore  we foresee no significant availability problems in the near future 
intellectual property rights patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
we own or license numerous patents and have patent applications pending in the united states and in other countries that relate to various aspects of our products 
in addition  key value added and proprietary products and processes are licensed from daikyo seiko  ltd 
our patents and other proprietary rights have been useful in establishing our market share and in the growth of our business  and are expected to continue to be of value in the future as we continue to develop proprietary products 
although important in the aggregate  we do not consider our business to be materially dependent on any individual patent or license 
we also rely heavily on trade secrets  manufacturing know how and continuing technological innovations  as well as in licensing opportunities  to maintain and further develop our competitive position  particularly in the area of formulation development and tooling design 
seasonality although our packaging systems business is not inherently seasonal  sales and operating profit in the second half of the year are typically lower than the first half primarily due to scheduled plant shutdowns in conjunction with our customers production schedules and the year end impact of holidays on production 
working capital we are required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet customer requirements 
in addition  some of our supply agreements require us to purchase inventory in bulk orders  which increases inventory levels but decreases the risk of supply interruption 
levels of inventory are also influenced by the seasonal patterns addressed above 
for a more detailed discussion of working capital  please see the discussion in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
marketing our packaging systems customers include practically every major branded pharmaceutical  generic and biopharmaceutical company in the world 
packaging systems components and other products are sold to major pharmaceutical  biotechnology and hospital supply medical device companies  which incorporate them into their products for distribution to the ultimate end user 
our delivery systems segment sells to many of the world s largest pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and medical device companies and to large customers within the personal care and food and beverage industries 
delivery systems components generally are incorporated into our customers manufacturing lines for further processing or assembly 

table of contents our products and services are distributed primarily through our own sales force and distribution network  with limited use of contract sales agents and regional distributors 
our ten largest customers accounted for of our consolidated net sales in  but none of these customers individually accounted for more than of net sales 
order backlog at december   our order backlog was million  all of which is expected to be filled during the order backlog was million at the end of the increase is primarily due to continued sales growth and a lengthening of the average lead time for sales orders 
order backlog includes firm orders placed by customers for manufacture over a period of time according to their schedule or upon confirmation by the customer 
we also have contractual arrangements with a number of our customers 
products covered by these contracts are included in our backlog only as orders are received 
competition we compete with several companies across our packaging systems product lines 
however  we believe that we supply a major portion of the us market for pharmaceutical elastomer and metal packaging components and also have a significant share of the european market for these components 
because of the special nature of our pharmaceutical packaging components and our long standing participation in the market  competition is based primarily on product design and performance  although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their operations 
we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a full service  value added global supplier that can provide pre sale formula and engineering development  analytical services  regulatory expertise and post manufacturing technologies  as well as after sale technical support 
customers also appreciate the global scope of west s manufacturing capability and our ability to produce many products at multiple sites 
our delivery systems business competes in very competitive markets for both healthcare and consumer products 
the markets we serve are also served by many competitors and  therefore  our market shares are generally less than of the total global markets 
the competition varies from smaller regional companies to large global molders that command significant market shares 
there are extreme cost pressures and many of our customers look off shore to reduce cost 
we differentiate ourselves by leveraging our global capability and by employing new technologies such as high speed automated assembly  insert molding  multi shot molding and expertise with multiple piece closure systems 
because of the more demanding regulatory requirements in the medical device component area  there are a smaller number of competitors  mostly large scale companies 
we compete for this market on the basis of our reputation for quality and reliability in engineering and project management  diverse contract manufacturing capabilities and knowledge of and experience in complying with fda requirements 
with our range of proprietary technologies  we compete with new and established companies in the area of drug delivery devices  including suppliers of prefillable syringes  auto injectors  safety needles and other proprietary systems 
research and development activities we maintain our own research scale production facilities and laboratories for developing new products  and offer contract engineering design and development services to assist customers with new product development 
our quality control  regulatory and laboratory testing capabilities are used to ensure compliance with applicable manufacturing and regulatory standards for primary and secondary pharmaceutical packaging components 
the engineering departments are responsible for product and tooling design and testing  and for the design and construction of processing equipment 
we continue to seek new innovative opportunities for acquisition  licensing  partnering or development within injectable packaging and delivery systems  most of which will be manufactured and marketed by our delivery systems segment 
research and development spending will continue to increase as we pursue innovative strategic platforms in prefillable syringe  injectable container  advanced injection and safety and administration systems 

table of contents commercial development of our new products and services for medical and pharmaceutical applications commonly requires several years 
new products that we develop may require separate approval as medical devices  and products that are intended to be used in packaging and delivery of pharmaceutical products will be subject to both customer acceptance of our products and regulatory approval of the customer s products following our development period 
we spent million in  million in and million in on research and development for the packaging systems segment 
the delivery systems segment incurred research and development costs of million  million  and million in the years  and  respectively 
environmental regulations we are subject to various federal  state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in employees as of december   we employed approximately  people in our operations throughout the world 
item a 
risk factors 
the statements in this section describe major risks to our business and should be considered carefully 
in addition  these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of our disclosure and analysis in this form k contains some forward looking statements that are based on management s beliefs and assumptions  current expectations  estimates and forecasts 
we also provide forward looking statements in other materials we release to the public as well as oral forward looking statements 
such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events 
they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
we have attempted  wherever possible  to identify forward looking statements by using words such as estimate  expect  intend  believe  plan  anticipate and other words and terms of similar meaning 
in particular  these include statements relating to future actions  business plans and prospects  new products  future performance or results of current or anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  economic effects  the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results 
many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our ability to control or predict 
achievement of future results is subject to known or unknown risks or uncertainties  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from past results and those expressed or implied in any forward looking statement 
you should bear this in mind as you consider forward looking statements 
unless required by applicable securities law  we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
we also refer you to further disclosures we make on related subjects in our quarterly reports on form q and k reports to the sec 

table of contents our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 
the current uncertainty in the global economy  including the continuing effects of recession or slow economic growth in the united states and europe  may negatively affect our operating results 
examples of the effects of these continuing global economic challenges include our suppliers and our customers inability to access the credit markets at commercially reasonable rates  reduction in sales due to customers decreasing their inventories in the near term or long term or due to liquidity difficulties  reduction in sales due to shortages of materials we purchase from our suppliers  reduction in research and development efforts and expenditures by our customers  our inability to hedge our currency and raw material risks sufficiently or at commercially reasonable prices  insolvency of suppliers or customers  inflationary pressures on our supplies or our products  and increased expenses due to growing taxation of corporate profits or revenues 
our operating results in one or more geographic regions may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic conditions within that region 
if economic and market conditions in the united states or europe weaken further  we may experience material adverse impacts on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our sales and profitability are largely dependent on the sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products 
if the products developed by our customers in the future use another delivery system  our sales and profitability could suffer 
our business depends to a substantial extent on customers continued sales and development of products that are delivered by injection 
if our customers fail to continue to sell  develop and deploy new injectable products or we are unable to develop new products that assist in the delivery of drugs by alternative methods  our sales and profitability may suffer 
if we are unable to provide comparative value advantages  timely fulfillment of customer orders or resist pricing pressure  we will have to reduce our prices  which may reduce our profit margins 
we compete with several companies across our major product lines 
because of the special nature of these products  competition is based primarily on product design and performance  although total cost is becoming increasingly important as pharmaceutical companies continue with aggressive cost control programs across their entire operations 
competitors often compete on the basis of price 
we differentiate ourselves from our competition as a full service value added supplier that is able to provide pre sale compatibility studies and other services and sophisticated post sale technical support on a global basis 
however  we face continued pricing pressure from our customers and competitors 
if we are unable to resist or to offset the effects of continued pricing pressure through our value added services  improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures  or if we have to reduce our prices  our sales and profitability may suffer 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries could adversely affect our future revenues and operating income 
the pharmaceutical and medical technology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation 
as a result of this consolidation  competition to provide goods and services to customers has increased 
in addition  group purchasing organizations and integrated health delivery networks have served to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers  which has placed pricing pressure on suppliers 
further consolidation within the industries we serve could exert additional pressure on the prices of our products 

table of contents we are subject to regulation by governments around the world  and if these regulations are not complied with  existing and future operations may be curtailed  and we could be subject to liability 
the design  development  manufacturing  marketing and labeling of certain of our products and our customers products that incorporate our products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the united states  europe and other countries  including the fda and the european medicines agency 
complying with governmental regulation can be costly and can result in required modification or withdrawal of existing products and a substantial delay in the introduction of new products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or failure to obtain regulatory approval for a new product could result in expenses and actions that could adversely affect our business and financial performance 
products incorporating our technologies are subject to regulations and extensive approval or clearance processes  which make the timing and success of new product commercialization difficult to predict 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is expensive and time consuming 
historically  most medical devices incorporating our technologies have been subject to the fda s k marketing approval process  which typically lasts from six to nine months 
supplemental or full pre market approval reviews require a significantly longer period  delaying commercialization 
pharmaceutical products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fda s new drug application process  which typically takes a number of years to complete 
additionally  biotechnology products incorporating our technologies are subject to the fda s biologics license application process  which also typically takes a number of years to complete 
outside of the united states  sales of medical devices and pharmaceutical or biotechnology products are subject to international regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approval for sale internationally may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
changes in the regulation of drug products and devices may increase competitive pressure and adversely affect our business 
an effect of the governmental regulation of our customers drug products  devices  and manufacturing processes is that compliance with regulations makes it costly and time consuming for customers to substitute or replace components and devices produced by one supplier with those from another 
the regulation of our customers products that incorporate our components and devices has increased over time 
if the applicable regulations were to be modified in a way that reduced the cost and time involved for customers to substitute one supplier s components or devices for those made by another  it is likely that the competitive pressure would increase and adversely affect our sales and profitability 
if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property rights  we may harm our ability to compete 
our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property are important to our business 
we rely on patent  trademark  copyright  trade secret  and other intellectual property laws  as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary information  technologies and process 
we also have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of third party intellectual property 
we may need to engage in litigation or similar activities to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could require us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations 
we cannot assure you that the steps we will take to prevent misappropriation  infringement or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of others will be successful 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited for some of our trademarks and patents in some countries 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our business and results of operations 
in addition  we may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar or duplicative to ours 

table of contents disruption in our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our ability to make and sell products and have a negative impact on our reputation  performance or financial condition 
we have manufacturing sites all over the world 
in addition  in some instances  the manufacturing of certain product lines is concentrated in one or more of our plants 
the functioning of our manufacturing and distribution assets and systems could be disrupted for reasons either within or beyond our control  including extreme weather or longer term climatic changes  natural disasters  pandemic  war  accidental damage  disruption to the supply of material or services  product quality and safety issues  systems failure  workforce actions  or environmental contamination 
there is a risk that incident management systems in place may prove inadequate and that any disruption may materially adversely affect our ability to make and sell products and  therefore  materially adversely affect our reputation  performance or financial condition 
the medical technology industry is very competitive and new products may replace our products or cause a reduction in demand 
the medical technology industry is subject to rapid technological changes  and we face significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold 
we face this competition from a wide range of companies 
these include large medical device companies  some of which have greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
we also face competition from firms that are more specialized than we are with respect to particular markets 
in some instances  competitors  including pharmaceutical companies  also offer  or are attempting to develop  alternative therapies for diseases that may be delivered without a medical device 
the development of new or improved products  processes or technologies by other companies such as needle free injection technology may render some of our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive 
risks associated with foreign operations  including changes in import export duties  political or economic climates  or exchange rates may adversely affect our business 
we conduct business in most of the major pharmaceutical markets in the world 
virtually all of the international sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars  which can result in significant fluctuations in the amount of those sales or earnings 
the exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
in addition to translation risks  we incur currency transaction gains or losses when we or one of our subsidiaries enters into a purchase or sales transaction in a currency other than that entity s local currency 
the main currencies to which we are exposed  besides the us dollar  are the euro  british pound  danish krone  singapore dollar  and japanese yen 
our international operations are also exposed to the following risks transportation delays and interruptions  political and economic instability and disruptions  imposition of duties and tariffs  import and export controls  the risks of divergent business expectations or cultural incompatibility inherent in establishing and maintaining operations in foreign countries  difficulties in staffing and managing multi national operations  labor strikes and or disputes  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or our joint venture partners outside of the united states could also create exposure 
in addition  we may not be able to operate in compliance with foreign laws and regulations  or comply with applicable customs  currency exchange control regulations  transfer pricing regulations or any other laws or regulations to which we may be subject  in the event that these laws or regulations change 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on our international operations in the future by reducing the demand for our products  decreasing the prices at which we can sell our products or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents disruptions in the supply of key raw materials and difficulties in the supplier qualification process could adversely impact our operations 
we employ a supply chain management strategy in our reporting segments  which involves purchasing from integrated suppliers that control their own sources of supply 
this strategy has reduced the number of raw material suppliers we have used in recent years 
this increases the risk that our supply lines may be interrupted in the event of a supplier production problem or financial difficulties 
if one of our suppliers is unable to supply materials needed for our products or our strategies for managing these risks are unsuccessful  we may be unable to complete the process of qualifying new replacement materials for some programs in time to meet future production needs 
prolonged disruptions in the supply of any of our key raw materials  difficulty completing qualification of new sources of supply  or in implementing the use of replacement materials or new sources of supply could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition or cash flows 
raw material and energy prices have a significant impact on our profitability 
if raw material and or energy prices increase  and we cannot pass those price increases on to our customers  our profitability and financial condition may suffer 
we use three basic raw materials in the manufacture of our products elastomers which include synthetic and natural material  aluminum and plastic 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities consume a wide variety of energy products to fuel  heat and cool our operations 
supply and demand factors  which are beyond our control  generally affect the price of our raw materials and utility costs 
if we are unable to pass along increased raw material prices and energy costs to our customers  our profitability  and thus our financial condition  may be adversely affected 
the prices of many of these raw materials and utilities are cyclical and volatile 
for example  the prices of certain commodities  particularly petroleum based raw materials  have in the recent past exhibited rapid changes  affecting the cost of synthetic elastomers and plastic 
while we generally attempt to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of sales price increases  historically there has been a time delay between raw material and or energy price increases and our ability to increase the prices of our products 
in some circumstances  we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pressure and other factors 
if we are not timely or successful in new product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi component systems  our future revenues and operating income could be adversely affected 
our growth partly depends on new product innovation and the development and commercialization of proprietary multi component systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications such as the daikyo cz ready to use prefilled syringe system 
product development and commercialization is inherently uncertain and is subject to a number of factors outside of our control  including any necessary regulatory approvals and commercial acceptance for the products 
the ultimate timing and successful commercialization of new products and systems requires substantial evaluations of the functional  operational  clinical and economic viability of the company s products 
in addition  the timely and adequate availability of filling capacity is essential to both conducting definitive stability trials and the timing of first commercialization of customers products in cz prefilled syringes 
delays  interruptions or failures in developing and commercializing new product innovations or proprietary multi component systems could adversely affect future revenues and operating income 
in addition  adverse conditions may also result in future charges to recognize impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents we may not succeed in finding and completing acquisition or other strategic transactions  if any  which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have historically engaged in acquisition activity and we may in the future engage in acquisitions or other strategic transactions  such as joint ventures or investments in other entities 
we may be unable to identify suitable targets  opportunistic or otherwise  for acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future 
if we identify a suitable candidate  our ability to successfully implement the strategic transaction would depend on a variety of factors including our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  and to comply with the restrictions contained in our debt agreements 
strategic transactions involve risks  including those associated with integrating the operations or maintaining the operations as separate as applicable  financial reporting  disparate technologies and personnel of acquired companies  joint ventures or related companies  managing geographically dispersed operations or other strategic investments  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which we have either limited or no direct experience  unknown risks  and the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies  joint ventures or companies in which we may make strategic investments 
we may not successfully integrate any businesses or technologies we may acquire or strategically develop in the future and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits relating to any such strategic transactions 
strategic transactions may be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
strategic transactions may not be accretive to our earnings and may negatively impact our results of operations as a result of  among other things  the incurrence of debt  one time write offs of goodwill and amortization expenses of other intangible assets 
in addition  strategic transactions that we may pursue could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities 
product defects could adversely affect the results of our operations 
the design  manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks 
manufacturing or design defects  unanticipated use of our products  or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other adverse events 
these events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products either voluntary or required by the fda or similar governmental authorities in other countries  and could result  in certain cases  in the removal of a product from the market 
a recall could result in significant costs  as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products 
personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in product liability claims being brought against us 
in some circumstances  such adverse events could also cause delays in new product approvals 
our operations must comply with environmental statutes and regulations  and any failure to comply could result in extensive costs which would harm our business 
the manufacture of some of our products involves the use  transportation  storage and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials and is subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
this has exposed us in the past  and could expose us in the future  to risks of accidental contamination and events of non compliance with environmental laws 
any such occurrences could result in regulatory enforcement or personal injury and property damage claims or could lead to a shutdown of some of our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we currently incur costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations and these costs may become more significant 

table of contents a loss of key personnel or highly skilled employees could disrupt our operations 
our executive officers are critical to the management and direction of our businesses 
our future success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain these officers and other key employees  including people in technical  marketing  sales and research positions 
competition for experienced employees  particularly for persons with specialized skills  can be intense 
our ability to recruit such talent will depend on a number of factors  including compensation and benefits  work location and work environment 
if we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified executives and employees  our business could be adversely affected 
although we believe that we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise  our inability to do so timely could disrupt the operations of the unit affected or our overall operations 
in addition  because of the complex nature of many of our products and programs  we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled engineering staff and workforce 
our operations could be disrupted by a shortage of available skilled employees 
the uncertain effects of potential climate change legislation could lead to significantly increased costs 
if legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the united states  europe or asia or any other jurisdictions in which we do business that limit or reduce allowable greenhouse gas emissions and other emissions  such restrictions could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions  including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions  and our results of operations 
our manufacturing operations may not be able to operate as planned if we are not able to comply with new legal and regulatory legislation around climate change  or it may become too costly to operate in a profitable manner 
additionally  suppliers added expenses could be passed on to us in the form of higher prices and we may not be able to pass on such expenses to our customers through price increases 
federal healthcare reform may adversely affect our results of operations 
the patient protection and affordable care act the ppaca was enacted in march the ppaca reduces medicare and medicaid payments to hospitals  clinical laboratories and pharmaceutical companies  and could otherwise reduce the volume of medical procedures 
the ppaca also imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on all us medical device sales 
these factors  in turn  could result in reduced demand for our products and increased downward pricing pressure 
it is also possible that the ppaca will result in lower reimbursements for our customers products 
while the ppaca is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the united states  the impact of any overall increase in access to healthcare on sales of west s products is uncertain at this time 
our sales depend  in part  on the extent to which pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers and facilities are reimbursed by government authorities  private insurers and other third party payers for the costs of our products 
the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third party payers  which can vary among public and private sources  may affect which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay for these products in a particular jurisdiction 
legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems in the united states as part of the ppaca or abroad for example  those under consideration in france  germany  italy and the united kingdom could significantly reduce reimbursement for our customers products  which could in turn reduce the demand for our products 
management continues to evaluate the ppaca and will review regulations to determine the impact on us 
no assurance can be given that we will continue to pay or declare dividends 
we have historically paid dividends 
however  there can be no assurance that we will pay or declare dividends in the future 
the actual declaration and payment of future dividends  the amount of any such dividends  and the establishment of record and payment dates  if any  are subject to determination by our board of directors each quarter after its review of our then current strategy  applicable debt covenants and financial performance and position  among other things 
our declaration and payment of future dividends is subject to risks and uncertainties  including deterioration of our financial performance or position  inability to declare a dividend in compliance with applicable laws or debt covenants  an increase in our cash needs or decrease in available cash  and the business judgment of the board of directors that a declaration of a dividend is not in the company s best interests 

table of contents our results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations 
we provide public guidance on our expected results of operations for future periods 
this guidance is comprised of forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties described in this form k and in our other public filings and public statements  and is based necessarily on assumptions we make at the time we provide such guidance 
our guidance may not always be accurate 
if  in the future  our results of operations for a particular period do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts or if we reduce our guidance for future periods  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
we are exposed to credit risk on accounts receivable and certain prepayments made in the normal course of business 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
a substantial majority of our outstanding trade receivables are not covered by collateral or credit insurance 
in addition  we have made prepayments associated with insurance premiums and other advances in the normal course of business 
while we have procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on trade receivables and other current assets  there can be no assurance such procedures will effectively limit our credit risk and avoid losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the following discussion is intended to further the reader s understanding of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of our company 
it should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains a number of forward looking statements  all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks discussed in part i  item a of this annual report on form k 
throughout this section  references to notes refer to the footnotes included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  unless otherwise indicated 
our operations we are a manufacturer of components and systems for the packaging and delivery of injectable drugs as well as delivery system components for the pharmaceutical  healthcare and consumer products industries 
our products include stoppers and seals for vials  prefillable syringe components and systems  components for intravenous and blood collection systems  safety and administration systems  advanced injection systems  and contract design and manufacturing services 
our customers include the leading global producers and distributors of pharmaceuticals  biologics  medical devices and personal care products 
we were incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania on july our business operations are organized into two reportable segments  which are aligned with the underlying markets and customers they serve 
our reportable segments are the pharmaceutical packaging systems segment packaging systems and the pharmaceutical delivery systems segment delivery systems 
packaging systems develops  manufactures and sells primary packaging components and systems for injectable drug delivery  including stoppers and seals for vials  closures and other components used in syringe  intravenous and blood collection systems  and prefillable syringe components 
delivery systems develops  manufactures and sells safety and administration systems  multi component systems for drug administration  and a variety of custom contract manufacturing solutions targeted to the healthcare and consumer products industries 
in addition  delivery systems is responsible for the continued development and commercialization of our line of proprietary  multi component systems for injectable drug administration and other healthcare applications 
we also maintain global partnerships to share technologies and market products with affiliates in japan and mexico 
as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence  more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the united states in currencies other than the us dollar  including in europe and collectively in south america  asia and other regions 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  therefore  can have a significant effect on our consolidated financial results 
generally  our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar  as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business 
in terms of net sales and operating profit  the most significant foreign currencies are the euro  the british pound  the danish krone and the singapore dollar  with euro denominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies 
in addition  we are exposed to japanese yen  as we maintain a ownership interest in  and we purchase finished goods and other materials from  daikyo seiko  ltd 
during  average exchange rates were favorable versus the exchange rates realized in  resulting in higher reported net sales and operating profit of million and million  respectively  versus financial performance highlights net sales were  million  an increase of from excluding foreign currency effects  net sales increased by million  or 

table of contents gross profit was million  an increase of from  and our gross margin percentage decreased slightly to 
we incurred restructuring and related charges of million associated with the plan announced in december segment operating profit was million  an increase of from including corporate costs and other unallocated charges  reported operating profit for was million  compared to in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in our financial position remains strong  with net cash provided by operating activities totaling million in our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share  which began with the fourth quarter dividend 
we achieved higher net sales in  primarily driven by a favorable mix of products and sales volume  a favorable foreign exchange impact  and sales price increases 
year over year sales increases were generated in all of our major geographic regions 
total sales originating in the united states were million  an increase of from  reflecting higher domestic demand for pharmaceutical packaging components and increased contract manufacturing activity 
revenues generated outside of the united states were million  an increase of from  which reflected higher demand in europe and continued growth in the asia pacific region 
excluding the favorable effects from currency translation  our non us net sales increased and our consolidated net sales increased from gross profit increased by million in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
consolidated gross margin decreased by percentage points in  primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs and wage and benefit increases  partially offset by sales price increases and product mix improvements as well as improved production efficiencies and cost saving initiatives 
the cost of natural rubber and materials linked to hydrocarbon prices  such as synthetic polymers and plastic resin  has increased significantly over the past year 
during periods of increased manufacturing costs  we generally incur incremental costs that are not immediately recoverable from our customers 
to help mitigate the lagging effect between the pricing mechanisms in our sales contracts and those in our raw material supply agreements  we implemented a temporary raw materials surcharge effective july the surcharge helped offset our raw material costs incurred during the year ended december   and remained in effect through the end of the year 
on a longer term basis  we expect to substantially recover raw material and other cost increases through sales price increases and continued cost reduction initiatives 
business outlook our business outlook for is positive  and we anticipate continued revenue improvement driven by high value packaging and prefilled syringe components in packaging systems 
we expect modest growth from proprietary devices in  as development work for the smartdose electronic patch injector system continues  and our customers execute their pre marketing and manufacturing trials for daikyo crystal zenith products 
in addition  we continue to believe that actions taken in recent years to increase capacity for certain products  reduce costs through restructuring and lean savings efforts  and expand into emerging markets will lead to improved profitability as global demand gradually increases 
we plan to continue funding capital projects in emerging markets for packaging systems and for new  proprietary products within delivery systems 
during  we expect our capital spending to be between approximately million and approximately million  including million related to the construction of our new corporate office and research building 
we believe that our strong financial position gives us a solid platform for sustained growth  and will enable us to take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business as they arise 
see part i  item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding the risks associated with our operations 

table of contents results of operations we evaluate the performance of our segments based upon  among other things  segment net sales and operating profit 
segment operating profit excludes general corporate costs  including stock based compensation  adjustments to annual bonus plan expense for over or under attainment  and certain pension and other retirement benefit costs 
also excluded from segment operating profit are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations 
such items are referred to as other unallocated items and generally include restructuring and related charges  certain asset impairments and other specifically identified income or expense items 
corporate costs include executive and director compensation  stock based compensation expense and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses that are not allocated to the segments 
for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year over year results  we often refer to net sales and other financial results excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the constant currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year s functional currency results at the prior year period s exchange rate 
these re measured results excluding effects from currency translation are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures 
the us gaap financial measures are incorporated into our discussion and analysis as management uses them in evaluating our results of operations  and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 
percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 
net sales the following table presents net sales  consolidated and by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions packaging systems delivery systems intersegment sales total net sales compared to consolidated net sales increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign currency effects  consolidated net sales increased by million  or  in sales volume contributed percentage points of the increase and sales price increases contributed percentage points of the increase 
packaging systems packaging systems net sales increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign exchange effects  net sales increased by  or  in increased demand for pharmaceutical packaging components  primarily in our europe and asia regions  contributed percentage points of the increase  and sales price increases contributed percentage points of the increase 
in  there was strong growth in sales of our high value pharmaceutical packaging products  including the recently introduced envision line of vision inspected components  daikyo and daikyo rsv ready to sterilize validated products  and westar processed and coated closures 

table of contents delivery systems delivery systems net sales increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign exchange effects  net sales increased by million  or  in a favorable mix of products and sales volume contributed percentage points of the increase  partially offset by lower sales prices of percentage points 
the majority of the sales growth resulted from increased sales of contract manufactured healthcare devices and drug reconstitution devices during despite sales price increases to offset the increased cost of plastic resin  overall sales prices were lower  due to scheduled price reductions under certain contract manufacturing agreements 
compared to consolidated net sales increased by million  or  in  despite an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign currency translation effects  consolidated net sales increased by million  or  in the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of improved sales volume and mix of percentage points  annual sales price increases of percentage points  and percentage points resulting from business acquisitions within our delivery systems segment 
packaging systems packaging systems net sales increased by million  or  in  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million and the surge in hn vaccination related sales 
excluding currency translation effects  net sales increased by million  or  in  resulting from favorable volume and product mix of million and higher sales prices of million 
the favorable volume and mix came primarily from sales of pharmaceutical packaging products due to increased demand for stoppers and seals used by our customers in packaging serums  lyophilized drugs  and for intravenous applications 
contributing to this improvement were increased sales of our advanced pharmaceutical packaging products including westar processed and flurotec coated closures as well as envision inspected components  which were first introduced in the sales increase was net of the impact from non recurring hn sales which benefited sales by million 
delivery systems delivery systems net sales increased by million  or  in  despite million of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of foreign currency changes  net sales increased by million  or  in the increase was principally driven by favorable volume and product mix of million and incremental sales from business acquisitions of million 
the majority of the favorable volume and mix was attributable to healthcare devices  due to strong customer demand for contract manufactured components and increased sales of our proprietary safety and administration systems 
the intersegment sales elimination  which is required for the presentation of consolidated net sales  represents the elimination of plastic packaging components sold by delivery systems to packaging systems 
gross profit the following table presents our gross profit and related gross margins  consolidated and by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions packaging systems gross profit gross margin delivery systems gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit consolidated gross margin 
table of contents compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
consolidated gross margin decreased by percentage points in  primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs  which reduced our consolidated gross margin by percentage points 
sales price increases and product mix improvements increased our gross margin by percentage points  but the impact was partially offset by wage and benefit increases  which reduced our consolidated gross margin by percentage points 
improved production efficiencies and cost saving initiatives contributed percentage points to our change in consolidated gross margin in the majority of the higher raw material costs related to natural rubber and materials linked to hydrocarbon prices  such as synthetic polymers and plastic resins 
packaging systems packaging systems gross profit increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
packaging systems gross margin decreased by percentage points in  primarily due to the impact of increased raw material costs  which reduced packaging systems gross margin by percentage points 
sales price increases and the temporary raw material surcharge partially offset the impact from higher raw material costs and other inflationary increases 
improved production efficiencies contributed percentage points to the change in packaging systems gross margin 
delivery systems delivery systems gross profit increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
delivery system s gross margin increased by percentage points in margin growth was constrained in due to the impact of contractually mandated sales price decreases and increased raw material costs  which combined to reduce delivery systems gross margin by percentage points 
these factors were fully offset by an improved product mix  production efficiencies and lower overhead resulting from our restructuring initiatives 
compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million  or  in  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million  as a result of higher sales in both of our reporting segments 
our gross margin percentage in was unchanged from the prior year as we were able to maintain margins with higher sales prices and a favorable sales volume and product mix  despite increased raw material  labor and depreciation expense 
packaging systems packaging systems gross profit increased by million  or  and the gross margin percentage increased by percentage points  in the increase was primarily the result of improved production efficiencies which resulted from higher volumes and operational cost saving initiatives 
the impact of sales price increases effectively offset year over year increases in labor cost  raw materials and other production costs incurred during the year 
delivery systems delivery system s gross profit increased by million  or  and our gross margin percentage remained constant at 
the higher gross profit was driven by an improvement in sales mix and higher demand for our contract manufactured healthcare devices  partially offset by increased raw material costs 
research and development r d costs year ended december  change in millions r d costs compared to r d costs increased by million  or  in  primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose electronic patch injector system  as well as continued development and validation activities for new advanced packaging and ready to use components and formulations 

table of contents compared to r d costs increased by million  or  in  primarily due to the impact of business acquisitions and incremental development spending on delivery systems initiatives  including various containment and delivery solutions using daikyo s crystal zenith technology 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs year ended december  change in millions sg a costs sg a as a of total net sales compared to sg a costs increased by million  or  in  including foreign currency translation effects of million and increased costs for outside services and information technology  partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense resulting from the impact of lower share prices on our deferred compensation plan liabilities  which are indexed to our stock price 
compared to sg a costs increased by million  or  in  primarily due to higher employee compensation costs for higher sales and other incentive compensation  annual salary increases  and increased staffing in support of our january business segment realignment 
despite the increase in year over year costs  sg a as a percentage of net sales remained relatively consistent 
restructuring and other items other income and expense items  consisting primarily of gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets  impairments of segment assets  and foreign exchange transaction gains and losses  are generally recorded within segment or corporate results 
certain restructuring  impairments and other specifically identified gains and losses considered outside of the control of segment management are not allocated to our segments 
the following table presents restructuring charges and other income and expense items for our segments  and corporate and other unallocated items  for each of the three years ended december in millions segments corporate and other unallocated items corporate restructuring and related charges special separation benefits acquisition related contingencies brazil tax amnesty benefits impairment charge restructuring and other items the majority of the segments other expense items for all periods presented was attributable to foreign exchange transaction losses experienced by our subsidiaries on non functional currency trade obligations 
restructuring and related charges during  we incurred restructuring and related charges of million associated with the restructuring plan announced in december charges associated with the plan in were primarily associated with the closure of a plant in the united states  a reduction of operations at a manufacturing facility in england  and the elimination of certain operational and administrative functions in other locations 
we currently expect to incur additional charges related to the plan of approximately million during 
table of contents during  we incurred restructuring and related charges of million  comprised of employee severance and benefits of million  fixed asset impairment charges of million  and fixed asset relocation costs and other related charges of million 
the majority of these charges related to the restructuring plan that our board of directors approved in december  which was designed to reduce our cost structure and improve operating efficiency 
during  we recognized restructuring and related charges of million  comprised of employee severance and benefits costs of million  asset impairment and disposals charges of million  and million in asset relocation costs 
the majority of this charge resulted from our restructuring plan  which affected certain business operations and support functions 
special separation benefits during  we incurred million in special separation benefits related to the retirement of our former president and chief operating officer 
these costs consisted primarily of stock based compensation expense and a settlement loss related to one of our non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
the respective equity compensation arrangements were amended to allow certain of his awards to continue to vest over the original vesting period instead of being forfeited upon separation  resulting in a revaluation of the awards and acceleration of expense 
acquisition related contingencies during and  we reduced the liability for contingent consideration related to our july eris safety syringe system acquisition by million and million  respectively  bringing the liability balance to zero 
this reduction reflects our assessment that none of the contractual operating targets will be achieved over the earnout period  which ends in during  we also increased the liability for contingent consideration related to our acquisition of technology used in our smartdose electronic patch injector system by million 
brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits in  we enrolled in a tax amnesty program that provided for reduced penalties and interest on certain tax related obligations  resulting in a gain of million 
impairment charge during  we determined that a cost basis investment that arose from the divestiture of a former drug delivery business was impaired  and we recorded a million charge to write off our investment 
see note  restructuring and other items  to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows in millions segments packaging systems delivery systems corporate and other unallocated items corporate costs other unallocated expense consolidated operating profit compared to consolidated operating profit increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
consolidated operating profit increased in primarily due to the increase in consolidated gross profit and the decrease in restructuring and other items described above  both of which were partially offset by the increases in r d costs and sg a costs described above 

table of contents packaging systems packaging systems operating profit increased by million  or  in  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
packaging systems operating profit increased in primarily due to the increase in packaging systems gross profit described above  partially offset by an increase in r d costs primarily due to continued development and validation activities for new advanced packaging and ready to use components and formulations 
delivery systems delivery systems operating profit increased by million  or  in delivery systems operating profit increased in primarily due to the increase in delivery systems gross profit described above  while its r d costs increased primarily as a result of development work on the smartdose electronic patch injector system 
compared to consolidated operating profit decreased by million  or  in  as a result of an increase in other unallocated charges  the majority of which was due to higher restructuring and related charges 
refer to the restructuring and other items section above for a discussion of these items 
packaging systems packaging systems operating profit increased by million  or  in  as a result of the improvement in gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in sg a as a result of higher employee compensation costs 
excluding a million unfavorable foreign exchange impact  packaging systems operating profit exceeded the amount by million 
delivery systems delivery systems operating profit decreased by million  or  in  as the increase in gross profit was offset by higher sg a costs and an increase in r d in support of their key product development projects 
interest expense  net the following table summarizes our net interest expense in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net  increased by million  or  in  primarily due to increased amortization of debt issue costs resulting from the june refinancing of our revolving credit facility and bank fees related to the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building 
interest expense  net  increased by million  or  in  primarily due to less capitalized interest resulting from significantly lower levels of capital spending in income taxes the provision for income taxes was million in and million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
in  we recorded million in net discrete tax charges from changes in international tax rates that affected our deferred tax carrying values 
in  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits primarily from the resolution of tax contingencies due to the expiration of open periods in various jurisdictions and the closing of a tax audit 
in addition to the effects of the discrete tax items  the increase in the effective tax rate as compared to the effective tax rate reflects the higher pretax income levels and geographic mix of earnings generated by the lower level of restructuring costs in the united states and our increased earnings in europe and asia 
our provision for income taxes was million  resulting in an overall effective tax rate 
in addition to the benefit of the items mentioned above  the effective tax rate was higher than the effective rate due to a reduction in qualified r d activity 

table of contents our effective tax rate for the year ending december  is expected to be approximately  absent the impact of discrete tax items or legislative changes in tax rates 
as of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million  if recognized  would favorably impact the effective income tax rate 
it is reasonably possible that  due to the expiration of statutes and the closing of tax audits  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by approximately million during the next twelve months  which would favorably impact our effective tax rate 
equity in net income of affiliated companies equity in net income of affiliated companies represents the contribution to earnings from our ownership interest in daikyo japan and our ownership interest in three companies in mexico 
equity earnings were million  million  and million for the years  and  respectively 
equity earnings increased by million  or  in  primarily due to increased gross profit reported by daikyo on higher sales of their pharmaceutical packaging products and specialty products 
equity earnings increased by million  or  in  primarily due to daikyo  as higher sales  gross profit and royalty income resulted in higher earnings 
purchases from affiliates totaled million in  million in and million in  the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million  and million in   and  respectively

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table presents cash flow data for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities compared to net cash provided by operating activities was million in  a decrease of million from net cash provided by operating activities decreased in primarily due to increased payments made under our restructuring plans and a higher level of pension funding 
compared to net cash provided by operating activities was million in  an increase of million from net cash provided by operating activities increased in as a result of favorable variances in other assets and liabilities  including lower cash paid for taxes in net cash used in investing activities compared to net cash used in investing activities was million in  an increase of million from net cash used in investing activities increased in primarily due to a million increase in capital spending and a million increase in net purchases of short term investments 
the short term investments represent certificates of deposit  primarily in israel  with maturities between three and nine months 
the majority of the increased capital spending was related to the expansion in capacity for manufacturing daikyo crystal zenith syringes at our scottsdale  az facility  which was nearly complete by the end of  as well as construction on our new compression molding plant in china  which is expected to be completed in construction of our new corporate office and research building began in and is expected to be completed in late or early  with final settlement occurring by early compared to net cash used in investing activities was million in  a decrease of million from net cash used in investing activities decreased in as a result of lower capital spending and reduced spending on business acquisitions 
cash paid for business acquisitions in  which included the ris safety syringe acquisition  was million higher than cash paid for businesses acquired in capital spending in totaled million  which was a million decrease from the prior year due primarily to the completion of several significant capital projects 
packaging systems capital spending was million  a decrease of million from the prior year which was attributable to the third quarter completion of our plastics plant in china  our european plants expansion project  and the implementation of new planning and manufacturing information systems in north america 
capital spending for the delivery systems segment was million  which was million below the level of spending in the prior year 
net cash used in financing activities compared to net cash used in financing activities was million in  a decrease of million from net cash used in financing activities decreased in primarily due to a reduction in net revolving credit facility repayments from in december  through a series of intercompany dividends from our international affiliates to the united states  we repatriated cash  which was subsequently used to pay down some of our outstanding debt  for general corporate purposes  and to increase our us cash reserves 
we paid cash dividends totaling million per share and million per share during the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents compared to net cash used in financing activities was million in  an increase of million from net cash used in financing activities increased in primarily due to a larger amount of debt repayments in compared to net cash used in financing activities for included million in net repayment of borrowings and debt issue costs compared with combined net debt repayments of million in the majority of debt repayments in both years was attributable to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we paid cash dividends totaling million per share and million per share during the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources based on our business outlook and our current capital structure  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our current business needs  new product development  capital expansion  pension and other post retirement benefits and to pay dividends 
we may also use our liquidity from time to time to repay debt  fund acquisitions  repurchase shares for treasury  and to make other investments 
we expect that our cash requirements for the next twelve months will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  short term investments  and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities 
the table below presents selected liquidity and capital measures as of december  in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital total debt total equity net debt to total invested capital cash and cash equivalents include all instruments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased 
short term investments include all instruments that have maturities between ninety one days and one year when purchased 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total equity 
cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  consisted of cash held in cash depository accounts with banks around the world and cash invested in high quality  short term investments 
the balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased during  primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of million 
cash balances outside of the united states decreased by million in  primarily due to a series of intercompany dividends from our international affiliates to the united states in december and the impact of weakening foreign currencies  primarily the euro  during the latter half of the repatriated cash was subsequently used to pay down some of our outstanding debt  for general corporate purposes  and to increase our us cash reserves 
the cash and cash equivalents balance at december  included million of cash held by subsidiaries outside of the united states  primarily in germany  singapore and ireland  which is available to fund operations and growth of non us subsidiaries 
bringing the cash into the united states could trigger us federal  state and local income tax obligations  however  we may temporarily access cash held by our non us subsidiaries without becoming subject to non us income tax by entering into short term intercompany loans 

table of contents working capital working capital at december  decreased by million  or  in  including a decrease of million due to foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of currency exchange rates  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  accounts receivable and inventories increased by million and million  respectively  and total current liabilities increased by million 
the increased accounts receivable balance was primarily the result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  and increased inventory balances were mostly due to higher raw materials costs and higher quantities of finished goods corresponding with higher orders on hand at december   as compared to december  the increase in current liabilities was due to a reclassification from long term debt of million related to our series a note due july  short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and an increase in trade accounts payable corresponding with the increased inventory production 
debt and credit facilities the million decrease in total debt in resulted from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of million and net repayments of million 
as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings under our million revolving credit facility  all of which was classified as long term debt based upon our intent and ability to continue the loans beyond one year 
during  we had an average outstanding balance of million under our revolving credit facility  including both the short and long term components 
our sources of liquidity include our million multi currency revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million of borrowing capacity available under this facility  and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds 
in addition  we entered into a credit agreement and related document in june which contains a million revolving credit facility 
the proceeds of the loans will be used to finance the construction and acquisition of our new corporate office and research building 
construction is expected to be completed by the end of  with final settlement occurring by early on the date of acquisition  the revolving loan balance will be converted to a five year term loan 
borrowings under the loans will bear interest at a variable rate equal to one month london interbank offering rates libor plus a margin of percentage points 
in anticipation of this debt  we entered into a forward start interest rate swap with the same notional amount in order to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable interest rate over the five year period beginning january under this swap  we will receive variable interest rate payments based on one month libor plus a margin in return for making monthly fixed interest payments at 
we designated the forward start interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 
as of december   there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
pursuant to the financial covenants in our debt agreements  we are required to maintain established interest coverage ratios and to not exceed established leverage ratios 
in addition  the agreements contain other customary covenants  none of which we consider restrictive to our operations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 
payments due by period in millions total less than year years years more than years purchase obligations long term debt interest on long term debt and interest rate swaps capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations 
table of contents our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers 
in accordance with us gaap  these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
in  we entered into an agreement for the construction and development of our new corporate office and research building 
the estimated purchase price of the building is million 
the actual purchase price will be based on construction and development costs incurred 
payment is due for the portion of the building covered by this contract upon final settlement  which is expected to occur by early in addition to this amount  we also expect to directly incur million in capital expenditures related to the building over the next twelve months 
for fixed rate long term debt  interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year end 
future interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year end 
interest on fixed rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at year end 
represents acquisition related contingencies 
in connection with certain business acquisitions  we agreed to make payments to the sellers when and if certain operating milestones are achieved such as sales and operating income targets 
this table does not include obligations pertaining to pension and postretirement benefits because the actual amount and timing of future contributions may vary significantly depending upon plan asset performance  benefit payments  and other factors 
the minimum required contributions to our plans are expected to be million in see note  benefit plans  to our consolidated financial statements for estimated benefit payments over the next ten years 
reserves for uncertain tax positions the table above does not include million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows  we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 
letters of credit we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers 
the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december   of which million is in excess of our deductible and  therefore  is reimbursable by the insurance company 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business  outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs  leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position 
table of contents revenue recognition the majority of our revenue within both segments is generated from product manufacturing operations and sales directly to our customers 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site  based upon shipping terms or legal requirements 
we offer volume rebates to certain customers as sales incentives 
provisions for rebates  as well as sales discounts and allowances  are accounted for as a reduction of sales when revenue is recorded 
we estimate rebates based on our assessment of the likelihood that required volumes will be attained using available information including historical experience 
we generally are able to ensure that products meet customer specifications prior to shipment 
we establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such liabilities are deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  are tested for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future expected undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset 
once an asset is considered impaired  an impairment loss is recorded within restructuring and other items for the difference between the asset s carrying value and its fair value 
for assets held and used in the business  management determines fair value using estimated future cash flows to be derived from the asset  discounted to a net present value using an appropriate discount rate 
for assets held for sale or for investment purposes  management determines fair value by estimating the proceeds to be received upon sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually  following the completion of our annual budget and long range planning process  or whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
our reporting units are the same as  or one level below  our operating segments 
the goodwill impairment test first requires a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  a second step must be performed 
the second step requires the comparison of the carrying amount of the goodwill to its implied fair value  which is calculated as if the reporting unit had just been acquired as of the testing date 
any excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over the implied fair value would represent an impairment loss 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test  such as future sales  future cash flows and long term growth rates  are consistent with internal projections and operating plans 
amounts and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test are also largely dependent on the continued sale of drug products delivered by injection and the packaging of drug products  as well as our timeliness and success in new product innovation or the development and commercialization of proprietary multi component systems 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
certain trademarks and in process r d have been determined to have indefinite lives and  therefore  are not subject to amortization 
impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible assets requires a comparison between the fair value and carrying value of the asset  and any excess carrying value would represent an impairment 
fair values are primarily determined using discounted cash flow analyses 
changes in the estimate of fair value could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  and reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 

table of contents as part of our annual long range planning process  our sales and marketing teams updated sales projections during the third quarter of  which indicated delays and lower than expected demand for our eris  confidose and novaguard product lines 
the revised projections triggered an impairment review of the assets associated with these product lines 
our review concluded that the future cash flows associated with these product lines were still expected to exceed the carrying value of the related assets and  therefore  no impairment charge was required 
we continued to monitor these product lines during our annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and determined that no impairment charge was required for these product lines 
at december   our investment in equipment and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  for eris  confidose and novaguard was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  no impairment in the carrying value of our reporting units was evident as a result of our annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
with the exception of our israel reporting unit  which had a fair value in excess of its carrying value by at least  each of our reporting units whose assets included goodwill had a fair value in excess of its respective carrying value by at least 
employee benefits we maintain funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the united states and a number of other countries that cover employees that meet eligibility requirements 
in addition  we sponsor postretirement benefit plans which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or become disabled 
the measurement of annual cost and obligations under these defined benefit postretirement plans is subject to a number of assumptions  which are specific for each of our us and foreign plans 
the assumptions  which are reviewed at least annually  are relevant to both the plan assets where applicable and the obligation for benefits that will ultimately be provided to our employees 
two of the most critical assumptions in determining pension and retiree medical plan expense are the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement age  rates of compensation increases  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
for our funded plans  we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our plan assets  as well as historical and expected rates of return in estimating the long term rate of return on plan assets 
under us gaap  differences between actual and expected results are generally accumulated in other comprehensive income loss as actuarial gains or losses and subsequently amortized into earnings over future periods 
changes in key assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
we estimate that every basis point reduction in our long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by million  and every basis point reduction in our discount rate would increase pension expense by million 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations 
our net pension underfunded balance at december  was million  compared to million at december  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was million at december   compared to million at december  income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation 
in addition  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability  generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level 
changes in tax legislation  business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 
when accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements  we apply a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices 
these risk factors can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
to manage these risks  we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures 
in accordance with company policy  derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we have subsidiaries outside the united states accounting for over of consolidated net sales 
virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes 
although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary  they may also hold assets or liabilities denominated in other currencies 
these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates 
we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize month end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans 
we have designated our million euro denominated notes as a hedge of our net investment in certain european subsidiaries 
we also have a million yen denominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our net investment in our japanese affiliate 
at december   a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of million net of tax of million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk as a result of our normal borrowing activities  we have long term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates 
long term debt consists of senior notes  convertible debentures  revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the following table summarizes our interest rate risk sensitive instruments in millions thereafter carrying value fair value current debt and capital leases euro denominated average interest rate fixed us dollar denominated average interest rate variable long term debt and capital leases us dollar denominated average interest rate variable us dollar denominated average interest rate fixed euro denominated average interest rate fixed yen denominated average interest rate variable 
table of contents as of december   we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a million note maturing on july  series a note and a million note maturing july  series b note 
the first interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note 
under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on three month libor in return for making quarterly fixed rate payments 
the interest rate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on our series a and b notes at and  respectively 
at december   the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of million  unfavorable to the company  of which  million was recorded as a current liability and million as a noncurrent liability 
commodity price risk many of our packaging systems products are made from synthetic elastomers  which are derived from the petroleum refining process 
we purchase the majority of our elastomers via long term supply contracts  some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to fluctuations in crude oil prices 
in recent years  increases in raw material costs have had an adverse impact on us 
we expect the volatility in raw material prices to continue 
we will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies  and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects on gross profit 
in january  we purchased a series of call options intended to mitigate our exposure to such oil based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of may through november these call options capped our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices for a portion of our forecasted purchases  allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices 
these call options were not designated as hedging instruments 
as of december   there were no options outstanding
