item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the company s cautionary statements as to forward looking statements contained in part ii  item risks related to our business bancorp and the bank are operating under regulatory agreements and an order which place significant limitations and obligations on bancorp and the bank until such time as they are lifted 
in late august  the bank entered into an agreement with the fdic  its principal federal banking regulator  and the dfcs which requires the bank to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
in connection with this agreement  the bank stipulated to the issuance by the fdic and the dfcs of a cease and desist order 
under the order  the bank is required to take certain measures to improve its capital position  maintain liquidity ratios  reduce its level of non performing assets  reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios  improve management practices and board supervision  and to assure that its reserve for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level 
on october   bancorp entered into a written agreement with the frb and dfcs  which requires bancorp to take certain measures to improve its safety and soundness 
under the written agreement  bancorp was required to develop and submit for approval a plan to maintain sufficient capital at bancorp and the bank 
as of december   bancorp did not meet the tier leverage ratio requirement per the written agreement  and is therefore required to deliver an updated capital plan to the frb and dfcs in this regard 
the order and written agreement  and corrective actions taken in response to them  are described in greater detail under the heading supervision and regulation in part i  item  business  above  and elsewhere in this report 
the order and written agreement remain in place until lifted by the fdic and dfcs  and frb and dfcs  respectively 
under the order and written agreement described above  the company is restricted or prohibited as to certain corporate or banking activities and or such activities may require the permission of our regulator including  but not limited to  merger or acquisition activities  certain forms of debt or equity issuance  and executive management changes 
the company is required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements  and if the company fails to maintain sufficient capital  whether due to losses  an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise  the financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations  as well as the company s ability to maintain regulatory compliance  would be adversely affected 
bancorp and the bank must meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  when and if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets  economic conditions and a number of other factors  including investor perfections regarding the banking industry and market condition  and governmental activities  many of which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if need or on terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition  liquidity  and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents bancorp relies on dividends from the bank  and the bank is currently prohibited from paying dividends to bancorp 
because of the elevated credit risk and associated losses incurred in  and  regulators have required bancorp to obtain permission prior to payment of dividends on its common stock 
in addition  pursuant to the order  the bank is required to obtain permission prior to payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
oregon laws prohibit the bank from paying dividends to bancorp unless the bank has positive retained earnings 
although the relevant statute allows the state of oregon to permit an adjustment of the retained earnings balance  the bank must become profitable and have positive retained earning prospectively to qualify for such adjustment 
accordingly  we do not expect the bank to pay any dividends to bancorp for the foreseeable future and bancorp does not expect to pay dividends to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
cascade bancorp is a separate legal entity from the bank and substantially all of its revenues are derived from bank dividends 
if the bank is unable to pay dividends to bancorp in the future  bancorp may not be able to pay dividends on its stock or pay its creditors  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
restrictions on the payment of dividends are described in greater detail under the heading regulations concerning cash dividends in part i  item  business  above  which includes a discussion of the bank s negative retained earnings  and elsewhere in this report 
the company may continue to be adversely affected by current economic and market conditions 
the company s business is closely tied to the economies of idaho and oregon in general and is particularly affected by the economies of central  southern  and northwest oregon  as well as the greater boise treasure valley  idaho area 
since mid  the country has experienced a significant economic downturn 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been negatively impacted and local governments and many businesses are being challenged due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
unemployment has increased significantly in idaho and oregon  and may remain elevated for some time 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans  and the value of collateral securing those loans  is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the company operates 
the current downturn in the economy and declining real estate values has had a direct and adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
the impact on the company has been an elevated level of impaired loans  and an associated increase in loan loss provision and charge offs for the company  leading to net losses for   and during the company sold approximately million carrying amount of certain non performing  substandard  and related performing loans and approximately million of oreo  in the bulk sale  the result of which decreased impaired loans 
however  no assurance can be given that adverse economic or real estate trends will not continue  which could cause an increase in the amount of non performing and substandard loans in the loan portfolio 
the company has a significant concentration in real estate lending 
the sustained downturn in real estate within the company s markets has had and is expected to continue to have a negative impact on the company 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio at december  consisted of loans secured by real estate located in oregon and idaho 
declining real estate values and reduced availability of mortgage financing have negatively impacted cash flows and real estate sales  which has adversely affected customers ability to repay loans 
in addition  the value of collateral underlying such loans has decreased materially 
the company has a material amount of adversely risk rated and non performing assets 
if borrowers fail to perform according to loan terms and if the company takes possession of real estate properties it could experience higher non performing asset levels in the future 
additionally  if real estate values continue to decline  the value of real estate collateral securing the company s loans could be significantly reduced  adversely affecting the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the bank s loans in other real estate portfolios including commercial construction and commercial real estate have experienced and may continue to experience reduced cash flow and reduced collateral value 
the bank has a significant concentration in loans secured by commercial real estate 

table of contents nationally  delinquencies in these types of portfolios are relatively high 
while the company s portfolios of these types of loans have not been as adversely impacted as residential related loans  there can be no assurance that the credit quality in these portfolios will not decrease significantly 
if they do  it may result in losses that exceed the estimates that are currently included in the reserve for credit losses  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be required to make further increases to its reserve for credit losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the company maintains a reserve for credit losses in an amount that the company believes is adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the reserve reflects management s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  industry concentrations  and other unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the reserve for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires the company to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside of the company s control  may require an increase in the reserve for loan losses 
increases in non performing loans have a significant impact on the company s reserve for loan losses 
generally  the company s non performing loans and assets reflect operating difficulties of individual borrowers resulting from weakness in the economies of the markets the company serves 
if real estate markets or the economy in general deteriorate further or do not sufficiently recover for an extended period of time  the company expects it that it may continue to experience increased delinquencies and credit losses 
there can be no assurance that the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan related losses 
additionally  banking regulators may require the company to increase its reserve for credit losses in the future  which could have a negative effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s reserve for credit losses may not be adequate to cover future loan losses  which could adversely affect its earnings 
the company maintains a reserve for credit losses in an amount that the company believes is adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while the company strives to monitor credit quality and to identify adversely risk rated loans on a consistent and timely basis  including those that may become non performing  at any time there are loans in the portfolio that could result in losses that have not been identified as problem or non performing loans 
estimation of the reserve requires us to make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of loans in the company s loan portfolio 
these assumptions and judgments include historical loan loss experience  current credit profiles of the bank s borrowers  adverse situations that have occurred that may affect a borrower s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimated value of underlying collateral and general economic conditions 
determining the appropriateness of the reserve is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become non performing assets  or that it will be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified 
as a result  future increases to the reserve for credit losses may be necessary 
additionally  future increases to the reserve for credit losses may be required based on changes in the composition of the loans comprising the loan portfolio  deteriorating values in underlying collateral most of which consists of real estate in the markets served and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as those that may result from changes in economic conditions  or as a result of incorrect assumptions by management in determining the reserve for credit loss 
additionally  banking regulators periodically review the company s reserve for credit losses 
regulators may require the company to increase its reserve for credit losses in the future  which could have a negative effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
during the year ended december   the company revised and continued to enhance its methodology for estimating the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
the reserve for loan losses at december  was significantly affected by the revisions and enhancements to the company s methodology for calculating its allowance for loan losses alll  as well as by the inclusion of charge offs 
table of contents incurred in the bulk sale of certain loans as it relates to its historical loss factors 
the significant revisions to the methodology included the application of historical loss factors by risk rating for each loan segment  as compared to the prior method which utilized blended historical loss factors  a change to historical look back periods  and refinement of the qualitative factors and application thereof used to adjust the estimated historical loss factors 
liquidity risk could impair the company s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition 
liquidity is essential to the company s business 
the company s primary funding source is commercial and retail deposits customers 
in addition the bank has historically had access to advances from the fhlb  frb discount window and other wholesale sources such as internet sourced deposits to fund operations 
although the company has historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary  it might not be able to replace such funds in the future depending on adverse results of operations  financial condition  capital ratings or regulatory restrictions 
an inability to raise funds through traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowings  the sale of securities or loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on the company s liquidity 
the company s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance activities on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
the company has established a significant liquidity reserve as of december   however  the ability to borrow or attract and retain deposits in the future could be adversely affected by the company s financial condition or regulatory restrictions  or impaired by factors that are not specific to the company  such as fdic insurance changes  further disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the banking industry 
per the terms of the order  the bank is presently restricted from accepting additional brokered deposits  including reciprocal certificate of deposit account registry service cdars program 
as of december   the company had no outstanding brokered deposits and de minimus cdars 
the bank s primary counterparty for borrowing purposes is the fhlb  and liquid assets are mainly held at correspondent banks or the frb 
borrowing capacity from the fhlb or frb may fluctuate based upon the condition of the bank or the acceptability and risk rating of securities or loan collateral  and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion 
the frb or fhlb could restrict or limit the company s access to secured borrowings 
correspondent banks can withdraw unsecured lines of credit or require collateralization for the purchase of fed funds 
in  the amount of collateral the bank was required to pledge against oregon public deposits was reduced to of the uninsured portion of these oregon public deposits  but the percentage of collateral required to be pledged could be increased in the future 
the bank is a public depository and  accordingly  accepts deposit funds that belong to  or are held for the benefit of  the state of oregon  political subdivisions thereof  municipal corporations and other public funds 
in accordance with applicable state law  in the event of default of one bank  all participating banks in the state collectively assure that no loss of funds is suffered by any public depositor 
generally  in the event of default by a depository of public funds in excess of collateral pledged  an assessment attributable to all public depositories is allocated on a pro rata basis in proportion to the maximum liability of each public depository as it existed on the date of loss 
the maximum liability is dependent upon potential changes in regulations  the occurrence of oregon bank failures and the level of public fund deposits held by the failing bank  and cannot be presently determined 
liquidity also may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
these circumstances have the effect of reducing secured borrowing capacity 
there can be no assurance that sources of funds will remain adequate for liquidity needs  and the bank may be compelled to seek additional sources of financing in the future 
there can be no assurance that additional borrowings  if sought  would be available or  if available  would be on favorable terms 
if additional financing sources are unavailable or not available on reasonable terms to provide necessary liquidity  the company s financial condition  results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents real estate values may continue to decrease leading to additional and greater than anticipated loan charge offs and valuation write downs on oreo 
real estate owned by the bank and not used in the ordinary course of its operations is referred to as oreo property 
in its normal lending process the bank may take title to real estate serving as collateral for loans 
in the event of obligor default  the bank may have the right to foreclose on such collateral 
at december   bank had oreo with a carrying value of approximately million relating to loans originated in the raw land  land development  residential and commercial real estate  and other portfolios 
generally  higher levels of oreo lead to greater expenses as the bank incurs costs to manage and dispose of the properties  including personnel costs  insurance  taxes  completion costs  repair costs  and other costs associated with property ownership 
there are also funding costs associated with oreo assets 
the bank evaluates oreo property values periodically and establishes valuations reserves  as appropriate  to adjust the carrying value of the properties to the lesser of book or appraised value  net of selling costs and any additional liquidation reserves to expedite the sale of such properties 
decreases in market prices may lead to additional oreo valuation reserves  with a corresponding expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
further valuation reserves of oreo or an inability to sell oreo properties could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the banking industry and the company operate under certain regulatory requirements which undergo frequent and often significant changes and that are expected to further impair revenues  operating income and financial condition 
the company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination  supervision  and comprehensive regulation by the dfcs  the fdic  and the federal reserve 
the regulations affect the company s investment practices  lending activities  and dividend policy  among other things 
moreover  federal and state banking laws and regulations undergo frequent and often significant changes and have been subject to significant change in recent years  sometimes retroactively applied  and may change significantly in the future 
changes to these laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies could  among other things  make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for the company  limit the products the company can offer or increase the ability of non banks to compete  and could adversely affect the company in significant but unpredictable ways which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and restricts certain activities  including payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits  access to capital and brokered deposits and locations of banking offices 
failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in fines  penalties  sanctions and damage to the company s reputation which could have an adverse effect on the company s business and financial results 
the bank s deposit insurance premium could be higher in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on its future earnings 
the fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions  including the bank 
the fdic charges the insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the dif at a certain level  if an fdic insured financial institution fails  payments of deposits up to insured limits are made from the deposit insurance fund 
current economic conditions have increased bank failures 
an increase in the risk category of the bank  adjustments to the base assessment rates  and or a significant special assessment could have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
management has concluded a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting exists with respect to the company s estimate of the reserve for loan losses 
during  management significantly refined and enhanced its model for calculating the reserve for loan losses and concluded that as of 
table of contents december   a sufficient period had not yet elapsed to provide the required remediation evidence that revised controls were operating effectively 
management previously disclosed a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in its annual report on form k for the year ended december  with respect to the company s estimate of the reserve for loan losses 
at that time  management had refined and enhanced its model and concluded that a sufficient period of time subsequent to december  had not yet elapsed to provide the required remediation evidence that the revised controls were operating effectively 
as of december  the enhanced methodology did not change the company s conclusion that the total reserve for loan losses was sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
there can be no assurance that the company s internal controls and procedures will not fail or be circumvented in the future 
changes in interest rates could adversely impact the company 
the company s earnings are highly dependent on the difference between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
in addition  changes to the market interest rates may impact the level of loans  deposits and investments  and the credit quality of existing loans 
these rates may be affected by many factors beyond the company s control  including general and economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
changes in interest rates may negatively impact the company s ability to attract deposits  make loans and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the financial services business is intensely competitive and the company s success will depend on its ability to compete effectively 
the company faces competition for its services from a variety of competitors 
the company s future growth and success depends on its ability to compete effectively 
the company competes for deposits  loans and other financial services with numerous financial service providers including banks  thrifts  credit unions  mortgage companies  broker dealers  and insurance companies 
to the extent these competitors have less regulatory constraints  lower cost structures  or increased economies of scale they may be able to offer a greater variety of products and services or more favorable pricing for such products and services 
improvements in technology  communications and the internet have intensified competition 
as a result  the company s competitive position could be weakened  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies on its computer information systems in the conduct of its business 
the company has policies and procedures in place to protect against and reduce the occurrences of failures  interruptions  or breaches of security of these systems  however  there can be no assurance that these policies and procedures will eliminate the occurrence of failures  interruptions or breaches of security or that they will adequately restore or minimize any such events 
the occurrence of a failure  interruption or breach of security of the company s computer information systems could result in a loss of information  business or regulatory scrutiny  or other events  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company continually encounters technological changes  and may have fewer resources than many of its competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements 
frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services in the financial services industry result in the need for rapid technological change 
in addition  the effective use of technology may result in improved customer service and reduced costs 
the company s future success depends  to a certain extent  on its ability to identify the needs of customers and address those needs by using technology to provide the desired products and services and to create additional efficiencies in its operations 
certain competitors may have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the company may not be able to successfully implement new technology driven products and services or to effectively market these products 
table of contents and services to our customers 
failure to implement the necessary technological changes could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company may not be able to attract or retain key banking employees 
the company expects future success to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with its clients by its executives and senior lending officers 
the company has entered into employment agreements with several members of senior management 
the existence of such agreements  however  does not necessarily ensure that the company will be able to continue to retain their services 
at this date the company has a vacancy and is actively recruiting for the position of chief credit officer  an important executive role 
the vacancy in the chief credit officer position or unexpected loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and possibly result in reduced revenues and earnings 
the company s future successes and profitability are substantially dependent upon the management and banking abilities of its senior executives  including the new ceo hired effective january the company strives to attract and retain key banking professionals  management and staff 
competition to attract the best professionals in the industry can be intense which will limit the company s ability to hire new professionals 
banking related revenues and net income could be adversely affected in the event of the unexpected loss of key personnel 
the value of certain securities in the company s investment securities portfolio may be negatively affected by disruptions in the market for these securities 
the company s investment portfolio securities are mainly mortgage backed securities guaranteed by government sponsored enterprises such as the federal national mortgage association fannie mae  the government national mortgage association ginnie mae  the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and fhlb  or otherwise backed by federal housing administration or veteran s administration guaranteed loans  however  volatility or illiquidity in financial markets may cause certain investment securities held within our investment portfolio to become less liquid 
this coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the credit risk associated with the underlying collateral or guarantors may cause material discrepancies in valuation estimates obtained from third parties 
volatile market conditions may affect the value of securities through reduced valuations due to the perception of heightened credit and liquidity risks in addition to interest rate risk typically associated with these securities 
there can be no assurance that the declines in market value associated with these disruptions will not result in impairments of these assets  which would lead to accounting charges that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  equity  and capital ratios 
the company is exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which it takes title 
in the course of business  the company may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
the company may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  if the company is the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  it may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if the company becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  its business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company s profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of  or defaults by  third parties who owe it money or other assets 
the company is exposed to the risk that third parties that owe it money or other assets will not perform their obligations 
these parties may default on their obligations to the company due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
the company s rights against third parties may not be 
table of contents enforceable in all circumstances 
in addition  deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations the company holds could result in losses and or adversely affect the company s ability to use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes 
the company relies on representations of potential borrowers and or guarantors as to the accuracy and completeness of certain financial information 
the company s financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted if the financial statements or other information that the company relies upon is materially misleading 
increased and or special fdic assessments will hurt the company s earnings 
the recent economic recession has caused a high level of bank failures  which has dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the balance of the dif 
as a result  the fdic has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance 
increases in the base assessment rate have increased the company s deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted earnings 
additional increases in the base assessment rate or additional special assessments would negatively impact earnings 
recent legislative and required regulatory initiatives will impose restrictions and requirements on financial institutions that could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the united states congress  the treasury department and the fdic have taken several steps to support the financial services industry  including certain well publicized programs  such as the troubled asset relief program as well as programs enhancing the liquidity available to financial institutions and increasing insurance available on bank deposits 
these programs have provided an important source of support to many financial institutions 
partly in response to these programs and the current economic climate  the president signed on july   the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of few provisions of the dodd frank act are effective immediately  with various provisions becoming effective in stages 
many of the provisions require issuance of regulations by the banking regulators and not all of these have been finalized 
these rules will increase regulation of the financial services industry and impose restrictions on the ability of firms within the industry to conduct business consistent with historical practices 
these rules will  for example  impact the ability of financial institutions to charge certain banking and other fees  allow interest to be paid on demand deposits  impose new restrictions on lending practices and require depository institution holding companies to maintain capital levels not less than the levels required for insured depository institutions 
the company cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation 
compliance with such legislation or regulation may  among other effects  significantly increase costs  limit product offerings and operating flexibility  require significant adjustments in internal business processes  and possibly require the company to maintain regulatory capital at levels above historical practices 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company generating future taxable income  and tax limitations applicable to the capital raise could result in permanent impairment of a portion of the company s deferred tax assets and or limit deductibility of certain losses in the future 
currently  the company maintains a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets at december  and realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income 
in addition  application of complex tax regulations resulting from the capital raise of january may otherwise limit tax deductions in the future

critical accounting policies and accounting estimates critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows 
reserve for credit losses 
the company s reserve for credit losses provides for estimated losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio and related loan commitments 
arriving at an estimate of the appropriate level of reserve for credit losses reserve for loan losses and loan commitments 
table of contents involves a high degree of judgment and assessment of multiple variables that result in a methodology with relatively complex calculations and analysis 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses and considers qualitative factors including economic conditions and a range of other factors in its determination of the reserve 
on an ongoing basis  the company seeks to enhance and refine its methodology such that the reserve is at an appropriate level and responsive to changing conditions 
however  the company s methodology may not accurately estimate inherent loss or external factors and changing economic conditions may impact the loan portfolio and the level of reserves in ways currently unforeseen 
the reserve for loan losses is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
the reserve for loan commitments is increased and decreased through non interest expense 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses  see loan portfolio and credit quality below in this item other real estate owned and foreclosed assets 
other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at estimated fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the reserve for loan losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the asset s fair value when it is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  a valuation allowance is recorded through non interest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as non interest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and posted to other non interest expenses 
deferred income taxes 
the provision credit for income taxes is based on income and expenses as reported for consolidated financial statement purposes using the asset and liability method for accounting for deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision credit for income taxes 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax assets to the expected amount to be realized 
at december  and  the company had a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
income tax positions that meet a more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of income tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with income tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits would be classified as additional income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations 
economic conditions the company s business is closely tied to the economies of idaho and oregon in general and is particularly affected by the economies of central  southern  and northwest oregon  as well as the greater boise treasure valley  idaho area 
the company s financial performance is directly and consequentially affected by the ability of borrowers to pay interest on  and repay principal of  outstanding loans 
the severity and duration of the economic downturn has affected and is continuing to affect business and consumer cash flows  reserves  and value of collateral securing loans 
the uncertain depth and duration of the present economic downturn could continue to cause further deterioration of these local economies  resulting in an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
real estate values in these areas have declined and may continue to fall 
unemployment rates in these areas have increased significantly and could increase further 
business activity across a wide range of industries and regions has been impacted 
many businesses are facing serious challenges due to elevated unemployment and economic uncertainty 

table of contents governmental and public entities are facing budget cuts and strains due to debt levels 
recently  the national and regional economies and real estate prices have shown signs of stabilization 
until economic conditions stabilize and recovery of the economy is evident  financial strains of customers may persist

the loan loss provision for the quarter related primarily to the reserve effect of the inclusion of bulk sale related charge offs on historical loss factors  risk rating changes within the loan portfolio  and changes in the level of expected losses on impaired loans

net interest income net interest margin for most financial institutions  including the company  the primary component of earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned  principally from loans and investment securities portfolio  and interest paid  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income typically result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
volume refers to the dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
spread refers to the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
margin refers to net interest income divided by interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total interest income decreased approximately million or for  and decreased approximately million or for due mainly to lower average earning loans  interest reversals on loans being placed on non accrual  and interest foregone on non performing loans 
total interest expense declined by approximately million or in mainly due to reduced volumes of interest bearing deposits  including higher cost internet cds and decreased borrowings due to the early repayment of certain fhlb advances and extinguishment of the debentures 
interest expense declined million or in as compared to mainly due to reduced volumes of interest bearing deposits

at december   the reserve for loan losses was approximately million while the reserve for unfunded commitments was million 
the bank maintains pooled and impaired loan reserves with additional consideration of qualitative factors and unallocated reserves in reaching its determination of the total reserve for loan losses 
the level of reserves is subject to review by the bank s regulatory authorities who may require adjustments to the reserve based on their evaluation and opinion of economic and industry factors as well as specific loans in the portfolio 
for further discussion  see critical accounting policies and estimates and loan portfolio and credit quality elsewhere in item of this report 
there can be no assurance that the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient to cover actual loan related losses

partially offsetting declines were increased income from bank owned life insurance boli of million 
total non interest income decreased million or compared to  in part because the earlier year period included a one time gain of million on the sale of our merchant services portfolio

table of contents recapture of previously realized deferred tax assets that are now deemed unrealizable  and a reduction of deferred tax assets due to section of the internal revenue code 
management determined the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance at december  and december  by evaluating the nature and amount of historical and projected future taxable income and the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and available tax planning strategies 
the ability to utilize deferred tax assets is a complex process requiring in depth analysis of statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance and estimates of future taxable income 
the amount of deferred taxes recognized could be impacted by changes to any of these variables 
for tax purposes  the issuance of common stock in connection with the company s capital raise in the first quarter of resulted in an ownership change of the company  as broadly defined in section of the internal revenue code 
as a result of the ownership change  utilization of the company s net operating loss carry forwards  tax credit carry forwards and certain built in losses under federal income tax laws will be subject to annual limitations and potential impairment 
the annual limitation placed on the company s ability to utilize these potential tax deductions will equal the product of an applicable interest rate mandated under federal income tax laws and the company s value immediately before the ownership change 
the annual limitation imposed under section may limit the deduction for both the carry forward tax attributes and the built in losses realized within five years of the date of the ownership change 
given the limited carry forward period assigned to these tax attributes in excess of this annual limit  a portion of these potential attributes have been permanently impaired and the related deferred tax asset and valuation allowance have been written off in and more may be limited or impaired in the future

real estate loan concentration risk 
real estate loans have historically represented a significant portion of the company s overall loan portfolio and real estate is frequently a material component of collateral for the company s loans 
risks associated with real estate loans include fluctuating land values  demand and prices for housing or commercial properties  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in tax policies  and concentration within the bank s market area 
the following provides information on the company s real estate loan portfolio 
all such lending activities are subject to the varied risks of real estate lending 
the company s loan origination process requires specialized underwriting  collateral and approval procedures  which mitigates  but does not eliminate the risk that loans may not be repaid 
the million commercial real estate or cre portfolio generally represents loans to finance retail  office and industrial commercial properties 
the expected source of repayment of cre loans is generally the operations of the borrower s business  rents or the obligor s personal income 
cre loans represent approximately of total loans outstanding as of december  approximately of cre loans are made to owner occupied users of the commercial property  while of cre loans are to obligors who do not directly occupy the property 
management believes that lending to owner occupied businesses may mitigate  but not eliminate  commercial real estate risk 
however no assurance can be given that residential real estate or other economic factors will not adversely impact the cre portfolio

table of contents reserve for loan losses 
the reserve for loan losses represents management s recognition of the assumed and present risks of extending credit and the possible inability or failure of the obligors to make repayment 
the reserve is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses on loans and unfunded commitments based on management s current assessment of a variety of current factors affecting the loan portfolio 
such factors include loss experience  review of problem loans  current economic conditions  and an overall evaluation of the quality  risk characteristics and concentration of loans in the portfolio 
the level of reserve for credit losses is also determined after consideration of bank regulatory guidance and recommendations and is subject to review by regulatory authorities who may require increases to the reserve based on their evaluation of the information available to them at the time of their examination of the bank 
the reserve is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
the reserve is increased by provisions charged to operations and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
see loan loss provision under consolidated results of operations years ended december    and above in this item during the year ended december   the company revised and continued to enhance its methodology for estimating the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses 
the significant revisions and enhancements to the methodology included the application of historical loss factors by risk rating for each loan segment  as compared to the prior method which utilized blended historical loss factors  a change to historical look back periods  and refinement of the qualitative factors and application thereof used to adjust the estimated historical loss factors 
the reserve for loan losses at december  was significantly affected by the revisions and enhancements to the company s methodology  as well as by the inclusion of charge offs incurred in the bulk sale of certain loans as it relates to its historical loss factors 
a description of the significant revisions and enhancements to the methodology for estimating the reserve for loan losses is as follows application of historical loss factors by risk rating for each loan segment and change in look back period  as compared to the prior method which utilized blended quarterly historical loss factors under the previous method  historical loss factors were computed using a rolling quarter basis  then weighted for the most current four quarters  for the next four preceding quarters  and for the final four preceding quarters 
the previous method applied these historical loss factors without regard to risk rating 
under the previous method  each of quarterly look back periods in the model included charge off experience for the preceding quarter 
under the enhanced method  historical loss factors are calculated using a minimum of quarterly look back periods applied by risk rating to each loan segment 
each look back period includes charge off experience by risk rating for each loan segment for the preceding four quarters 
historical loss rates for each period are averaged and multiplied by current loan balances for each risk rating category within loan segments to estimate loss reserve 
in addition  the company made minor refinements to its loan segment groups according to related risk attributes and applied statistical smoothing techniques considered appropriate to the change in method 
refinement of qualitative factors the company refined the qualitative factors used to adjust the historical loss factors by more explicitly detailing the specific qualitative factors to be considered and the determination of the resulting quantitative amounts 
in addition  certain qualitative factors are included in the estimate of total reserve for loan losses to achieve directional consistency and reflect uncertainties such as lack of seasoning in the revised and enhanced model 
at december   management believes that the company s reserve is at an appropriate level under current circumstances and prevailing economic conditions 
however  the total amount of actual loan losses may vary significantly from the estimated amount 
no assurance can be given that in any particular period  the reserve for credit losses will be sufficient  or that loan losses will not be sustained that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that changing economic factors or other environmental conditions will not require increases in the loan loss provision 

table of contents the company classifies reserves for unfunded commitments as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
such reserves are included as part of the overall reserve for credit losses 
reserves for unfunded commitments totaled approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
allocation of reserve for credit losses 
allocation of reserves is a function of historical loss factors as applied to rating of loans within each segment of the portfolio 
the higher reserve for loan losses in recent years is attributable to the effect the adverse economy has had on the ability of obligors to repay loans as measured by internal risk rating of various loans 
the unallocated portion of the reserve reflects the level of uncertainty as to the future direction and severity of the economic environment 
prior to december   the level of unallocated reserves included amounts now captured in the current methodology through certain loss factors and qualitative considerations 
while a combination of evidence demonstrating greater clarity on construction lot exposure and reduced exposure levels has lessened concern in this loan portfolio  risk in other asset categories continues 
typical factors leading to changes in reserve allocation include changes in debt service coverage ratios  guarantor and or collateral valuation as well as economic conditions that may have a specific or generalized impact on the relative risks inherent in various loan portfolios 
although this allocation process may not accurately predict credit losses by loan type or in the aggregate  the total reserve for loan losses is available to absorb losses that may arise from any loan type or category 
the following table allocates the reserve for credit losses among major loan types

loans placed on nonaccrual status may or may not be contractually past due at the time of such determination  and may or may not be secured 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  it is the bank s policy to reverse  and charge against current income  interest previously accrued but uncollected 
interest subsequently collected on such loans is credited to loan principal if  in the opinion of management  full collectability of principal is doubtful 
interest income that was reversed and charged against income was million in  million in  and million in during our normal loan review procedures  a loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair market value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans are currently measured at lower of cost or fair value 
certain small balance homogeneous loans are collectively measured for impairment 
impaired loans are charged to the allowance when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions  collection efforts and collateral position that the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of principal is not probable

the company s capital includes no qualifying debt following the extinguishment of tps related debt in the first quarter of federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement  and any other measure of capital deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulator for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
as mentioned earlier in this report the bank is operating under a regulatory order and bancorp is operating under the written agreement 
at december   bancorp s tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively  and the bank s tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital ratios were  and  respectively  which meet regulatory benchmarks for well capitalized 
regulatory benchmarks for a well capitalized designation are  and for tier leverage  tier risk based capital and total risk based capital  respectively 
however  as mentioned elsewhere in this report  the bank and bancorp are required to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
at december   bancorp did not meet this requirement and therefore is required to file an updated capital plan with the frb and dfcs in this regard 
additional information regarding capital resources are located in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
under the order  the bank is required to take certain measures to improve its capital position  maintain liquidity ratios  reduce its level of non performing assets  reduce its loan concentrations in certain portfolios  improve management practices and board supervision  and to assure that its reserve for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level 
at december  the bank was able to implement certain measures in the time frame provided  particularly those related to raising capital levels 
the order remains in place until lifted by the fdic and dfcs  and therefore  the bank remains subject to the requirements and restrictions set forth therein 
from time to time the company makes commitments to acquire banking properties or to make equipment or technology related investments of capital 
at december   the company had no material capital expenditure commitments apart from those incurred in the ordinary course of business 
liquidity and sources of funds the objective of the bank s liquidity management is to maintain ample cash flows to meet obligations for depositor withdrawals  to fund the borrowing needs of loan customers  and to fund ongoing operations 
at december   liquid assets of the bank are mainly interest bearing balances held at frb totaling million compared to million at december  core relationship deposits are the bank s primary source of funds 
as such  the bank focuses on deposit relationships with local business and consumer clients who maintain multiple accounts and services at the bank 
the company views such deposits as the foundation of its long term liquidity because it believes such core deposits are more stable and less sensitive to changing interest rates and other economic factors compared to large time deposits or wholesale purchased funds 
the bank s customer relationship strategy has resulted in a relatively higher percentage of its deposits being held in checking and money market accounts  and a lesser percentage in time deposits 
the bank augments core deposits with wholesale funds from time to time 
the bank is currently restricted under the terms of the order from accepting or renewing brokered deposits 
at december  and  the company did not have any brokered deposits 
local relationship based reciprocal cdars deposits which are also technically classified as brokered deposits were also zero at december   down from million at december  at december   the bank had no internet sourced deposits compared to approximately million at year end such deposits are sourced by posting time 
table of contents deposit rates on an internet site where institutions seeking to deploy funds contact the bank directly to open a deposit account 
in january and february of  the bank exercised its option to call approximately million of its internet deposits 
these time deposits had rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from march to january in december the bank elected to repay its remaining internet deposits approximately million 
these time deposits had rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from december to april in connection with these transactions  the bank was required to pay interest through the scheduled maturity dates of the deposits aggregating approximately million 
accordingly  the bank had no internet deposits at december  with the recapitalization of the bank in january and its becoming compliant with fdic capital standards  restrictions on its acceptance of public fund deposits were subsequently lifted 
current rules imposed by the oregon state treasury require that the bank collateralize of the uninsured public funds held by the bank 
at december   the bank was in compliance with this statute 
the bank also utilizes borrowings and lines of credit as sources of funds 
at december   the fhlb had extended the bank a secured line of credit of million of total assets accessible for short or long term borrowings given sufficient qualifying collateral 
as of december   the bank had qualifying collateral pledged for fhlb borrowings totaling million of which the bank had utilized million in secured borrowings and million of a fhlb letter of credit used for collateralization of oregon public deposits held by the bank 
at december   the bank also had undrawn borrowing capacity at frb of approximately million supported by specific qualifying collateral 
borrowing capacity from fhlb or frb may fluctuate based upon the acceptability and risk rating of loan collateral  and counterparties could adjust discount rates applied to such collateral at their discretion 
also  frb or fhlb could restrict or limit our access to secured borrowings 
correspondent banks have extended million in unsecured or collateralized short term lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under these federal fund borrowing agreements 
liquidity may be affected by the bank s routine commitments to extend credit 
at december   the bank had approximately million in outstanding commitments to extend credit  compared to approximately million at year end at this time  management believes that the bank s available resources will be sufficient to fund its commitments in the normal course of business 
the investment portfolio also provides a secondary source of funds as investments may be pledged for borrowings or sold for cash 
this liquidity is limited  however  by counterparties willingness to accept securities as collateral and the market value of securities at the time of sale could result in a loss to the bank 
as of december   unpledged investments totaled approximately million compared to million at december  the order further requires the bank to maintain a primary liquidity ratio net cash  plus net short term and marketable assets divided by net deposits and short term liabilities of at least 
as of december   the bank s primary liquidity ratio was 
bancorp is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is dividends received from the bank 
oregon banking laws impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends by oregon state chartered banks 
the amount of the dividend may not be greater than the bank s unreserved retained earnings  deducting from that  to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve  the following all bad debts  which are debts on which interest is past due and unpaid for at least six months  unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection  all other assets charged off as required by the director of the department of consumer and business services or a state or federal examiner  and all accrued expenses  interest and taxes of the institution 
since the bank currently has retained earnings that are a negative million  the bank will not under oregon law be able to pay any dividends until it has had sufficient positive earnings to return its negative retained earnings to a positive number or the oregon director permits the bank to apply part of its paid in capital to reduce the deficit in retained earnings 
in addition  pursuant to the order  the bank is required to seek permission from its regulators prior to payment of cash dividends on its common stock 
we do not expect the bank to pay dividends to bancorp for the foreseeable future 

table of contents additional information regarding limits on the payment of dividends may be found throughout item of this report  including under the headings supervision and regulation and regulations concerning cash dividends  in item of this report and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
inflation the effect of changing prices on financial institutions is typically different than on non banking companies since a substantial portion of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
in particular  interest rates are significantly affected by inflation  but neither the timing nor magnitude of the changes to interest rates can be directly correlated to price level indices  therefore  the company can best counter inflation over the long term by managing sensitivity to interest rates of its net interest income and controlling levels of non interest income and expenses
