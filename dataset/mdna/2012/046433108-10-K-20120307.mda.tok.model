item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the liquidity section of this report 
competitive conditions we experience considerable competition in the market sectors we serve  principally with respect to product performance and price  from various competitors  many of which are substantially larger and have greater resources 
success in the markets we serve depends upon product innovation  customer support  responsiveness  and cost management 
we continue to invest in developing the technologies and engineering support critical to competing in our markets 
government contracts all us government contracts  including subcontracts where the us government is the ultimate customer  may be subject to termination at the election of the government 
our revenue stream relies on military spending  as a significant portion of the test systems revenue is derived from military applications 
raw materials materials  supplies and components are purchased from numerous sources 
we believe that the loss of any one source  although potentially disruptive in the short term  would not materially affect our operations in the long term 
seasonality our business is typically not seasonal 
backlog at december   our backlog was approximately million 
at december   our backlog was approximately million 
backlog in the aerospace segment was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
approximately million for the december  backlog is expected to be realized in backlog in the test systems segment was approximately million at december  of which approximately million is expected to be realized in patents we have a number of patents 
while the aggregate protection of these patents is of value  our only material business that is dependent upon the protection afforded by these patents is our cabin power distribution product 
our patents and patent applications relate to electroluminescence  instrument panels  keyboard technology and a broad patent covering the cabin power distribution technology 
we regard our expertise and techniques as proprietary and rely upon trade secret laws and contractual arrangements to protect our rights 
we have trademark protection in major markets 

table of contents research  development and engineering activities we are engaged in a variety of engineering and design activities as well as basic research and development activities directed to the substantial improvement or new application of our existing technologies 
these costs are expensed when incurred and included in cost of sales 
research and development and engineering costs amounted to approximately million in  million in and million in employees we employed  employees as of december  we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
stock distribution on august   we announced a one for ten distribution of class b stock to holders of both common and class b stock 
on or about august   stockholders received one share of class b stock for every ten shares of common and class b stock held on the record date of august  all share quantities  share prices and per share data reported throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the impact of this distribution

table of contents item a 
risk factors the loss of panasonic avionics corporation or the u 
s 
government as major customers or a significant reduction in sales to either or both of those two customers would reduce our sales and earnings 
in we had a concentration of sales to panasonic representing approximately of our sales and to the us government representing approximately of our sales 
the loss of one or both of these customers or a significant reduction in sales to them would significantly reduce our sales and earnings 
the amount of debt we have outstanding  as well as any debt we may incur in the future  could have an adverse effect on our operational and financial flexibility 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding  of which million is long term debt 
changes to our level of debt subsequent to december  could have significant consequences to our business  including the following depending on interest rates and debt maturities  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be dedicated to paying principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for our acquisition strategy  capital expenditures or other purposes  a significant amount of debt could make us more vulnerable to changes in economic conditions or increases in prevailing interest rates  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures or for other purposes could be impaired  the increase in the amount of debt we have outstanding increases the risk of non compliance with some of the covenants in our debt agreements which require us to maintain specified financial ratios  and we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors  which may result in a competitive disadvantage 
we are subject to debt covenant restrictions 
our credit facility contains several financial and other restrictive covenants 
a significant decline in our operating income could cause us to violate our maximum leverage ratio or fixed charge ratio 
a covenant violation would require a waiver by the lenders or an alternative financing arrangement be achieved 
this could result in our being unable to borrow under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance and renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness 
historically both choices have been available to us however it is difficult to predict the availability of these options in the future 
our future operating results could be impacted by estimates used to calculate impairment losses on long term assets 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant and subjective estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of long term assets in the financial statements 
these estimates are integral in the determination of whether a potential impairment loss exists as well as the calculation of that loss 
actual future results could differ from those estimates 
a write off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results  net worth and cause us to violate covenants in our bank credit facility 
at december   goodwill and purchased intangible assets were approximately and approximately of our total assets respectively 
our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our strategy includes growing through acquisitions 
we may have to write off all or part of our goodwill or purchased intangible assets if their value becomes impaired 
although this write off would be a non cash charge  it could reduce our earnings and net worth significantly 
the markets we serve are cyclical and sensitive to domestic and foreign economic conditions and events  which may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
in our aerospace segment  demand by the business jet markets for our products is dependent upon several factors  including capital investment  product 
table of contents innovations  economic growth and wealth creation  and technology upgrades 
in addition  the commercial airline industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to fuel price increases  labor disputes  global economic conditions  availability of capital to fund new aircraft purchases and upgrades of existing aircraft and passenger demand 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction in the amount of air travel and the ability of airlines to invest in new aircraft or to upgrade existing aircraft 
these factors would reduce orders for new aircraft and would likely reduce airlines spending for cabin upgrades for which we supply products  thus reducing our sales and profits 
a reduction in air travel may also result in our commercial airline customers being unable to pay our invoices on a timely basis or not at all 
we are a supplier on various new aircraft programs just entering or expected to begin production in the future such as the boeing  f joint strike fighter and lear as with any new program there is risk as to whether the aircraft or program will be successful and accepted by the market 
as is customary for our business we purchase inventory and invest in specific capital equipment to support our production requirements generally based on delivery schedules provided by our customer 
if a program or aircraft is not successful we may have to write off all or a part of the inventory  accounts receivable and capital equipment related to the program 
a write off of these assets could result in a significant reduction of earnings and cause covenant violations relating to our debt agreements 
this could result in our being unable to borrow additional funds under our bank credit facility or being obliged to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our bank indebtedness 
in our test systems segment  demand for our products is dependent upon several factors  including government funding levels for our products  our ability to compete successfully for those contracts and our ability to develop products to satisfy the demands of our customers 
a change in any of these factors could result in a reduction of our sales and profits 
our products are sold in highly competitive markets 
some of our competitors are larger  more diversified corporations and have greater financial  marketing  production and research and development resources 
as a result  they may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns 
our operations and financial performance will be negatively impacted if our competitors develop products that are superior to our products  develop products that are more competitively priced than our products  develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies or evolving customer requirements 
we believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality  price  design and engineering capabilities  product development  conformity to customer specifications  quality of support after the sale  timeliness of delivery and effectiveness of the distribution organization 
maintaining and improving our competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing  engineering  quality standards  marketing  customer service and support and our distribution networks 
if we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments  or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position  our operations and financial performance will suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management team and technical personnel 
the loss of members of our management team could have a material and adverse effect on our business 
in addition  competition for qualified technical personnel in our industry is intense  and we believe that our future growth and success will depend on our ability to attract  train and retain such personnel 
future terror attacks  war  or other civil disturbances could negatively impact our business 
continued terror attacks  war or other disturbances could lead to further economic instability and decreases in demand for our products  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist attacks world wide have caused instability from time to time in global financial markets and the aviation 
table of contents industry 
the long term effects of terrorist attacks on us are unknown 
these attacks and the us government s continued efforts against terrorist organizations may lead to additional armed hostilities or to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbance in the united states or elsewhere  which may further contribute to economic instability 
if we are unable to adapt to technological change  demand for our products may be reduced 
the technologies related to our products have undergone  and in the future may undergo  significant changes 
to succeed in the future  we will need to continue to design  develop  manufacture  assemble  test  market and support new products and enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis 
our competitors may develop technologies and products that are more effective than those we develop or that render our technology and products obsolete or uncompetitive 
furthermore  our products could become unmarketable if new industry standards emerge 
we may have to modify our products significantly in the future to remain competitive  and new products we introduce may not be accepted by our customers 
our new product development efforts may not be successful  which would result in a reduction in our sales and earnings 
we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development of new products or product enhancements  and new products or product enhancements may not be accepted by our customers 
in addition  the development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates  and new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs 
if any of these events occur  our sales and profits could be adversely affected 
we depend on government contracts and subcontracts with defense prime contractors and sub contractors that may not be fully funded  may be terminated  or may be awarded to our competitors 
the failure to be awarded these contracts or failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales 
sales to the us government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business 
the funding of these programs is generally subject to annual congressional appropriations  and congressional priorities are subject to change 
in addition  government expenditures for defense programs may decline or these defense programs may be terminated 
a decline in governmental expenditures or the termination of existing contracts may result in a reduction in the volume of contracts awarded to us 
we have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts were terminated  we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources 
if our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations  our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted 
many of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services we must provide to our customers 
there is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor or customer concerns about the subcontractor 
failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed upon supplies or perform the agreed upon services may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations with our customer 
subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default 
a default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders 
in addition  a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers needs and may have an adverse effect upon our profitability 
our results of operations are affected by our fixed price contracts  which could subject us to losses in the event that we have cost overruns 
for the year ended december   fixed price contracts represented almost all of the company s sales 
on fixed price contracts  we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price 
depending on the fixed price negotiated  these contacts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our costs and the contract s fixed price 
however  we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit 
some of our contracts contain late delivery penalties 
failure to deliver in a timely manner due to supplier problems  development schedule slides  manufacturing difficulties  or similar schedule related events could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents the failure of our products may damage our reputation  necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage  thereby requiring us to pay significant damages 
defects in the design and manufacture of our products may necessitate a product recall 
we include complex system design and components in our products that could contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products 
if any of our products are defective  we could be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products 
we are also exposed to product liability claims 
we carry aircraft and non aircraft product liability insurance consistent with industry norms 
however  this insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim 
a product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our facilities could be damaged by catastrophes which could reduce our production capacity and result in a loss of customers 
we conduct our operations in facilities located throughout the united states and canada 
these facilities could be damaged by fire  floods  high winds  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events 
although we carry property insurance  including business interruption insurance  our inability to meet customers schedules as a result of catastrophe may result in a loss of customers or significant additional costs such as penalty claims under customer contracts 
changes in discount rates and other estimates could affect our future earnings and equity 
pension obligations and the related costs are determined using actual results and actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions 
the most critical assumption is the discount rate 
other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age 
the discount rate assumptions are based on current market conditions and are outside of our control 
changes in these assumptions could affect our future earnings and equity 
we are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks that could adversely affect our business  liquidity and operating results 
changes in the availability  terms and cost of capital  increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating could cause our cost of doing business to increase and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
at december   approximately of our debt was at fixed interest rates with the remaining percentage subject to variable interest rates 
we are subject to the risk of loss resulting from our customers defaulting on their obligations to us 
the inability of our customers to pay us due to adverse economic conditions or their inability to access available credit could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
contracting in the defense industry is subject to significant regulation  including rules related to bidding  billing and accounting kickbacks and false claims  and any non compliance could subject us to fines and penalties or possible debarment 
like all government contractors  we are subject to risks associated with this contracting 
these risks include the potential for substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties 
these fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules  employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards  receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims 
we have been  and expect to continue to be  subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies 
the failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation 
it could also result in suspension or debarment from future government contracts 
if we fail to meet expectations of securities analysts or investors due to fluctuations in our revenue or operating results  our stock price could decline significantly 
our revenue and earnings may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including delays or cancellations of programs 
it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the trading price of our stock could decline significantly 

table of contents our stock price is volatile 
for the year ended december   our stock price ranged from a low of to a high of 
the price of our common stock has been and likely will continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  variances of our quarterly results of operations from securities analyst estimates  changes in financial estimates  announcements of technological innovations  new products  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for companies in the aerospace industry in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the companies affected by these fluctuations 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
we may incur losses and liabilities as a result of our acquisition strategy 
growth by acquisition involves risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results  including diversion of management time and attention from our core business  the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities  the potential that expected benefits or synergies are not realized and that operating costs increase  the risks associated with incurring additional acquisition indebtedness  including that additional indebtedness could limit our cash flow availability for operations and our flexibility  difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  and the potential loss of key employees  suppliers or customers of acquired businesses 
in addition  any acquisition  once successfully integrated  could negatively impact our financial performance if it does not perform as planned  does not increase earnings  or does not prove otherwise to be beneficial to us 
we currently are involved or may become involved in the future  in legal proceedings that  if adversely adjudicated or settled  could materially impact our financial condition 
as an aerospace company  we may become a party to litigation in the ordinary course of our business  including  among others  matters alleging product liability  warranty claims  breach of commercial or government contract or other legal actions 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact results of operations and financial condition

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview astronics corporation  through its subsidiaries astronics advanced electronic systems corp  luminescent systems inc  luminescent systems canada inc  dme corporation and ballard technology  inc 
designs and manufactures electrical power generation systems  electrical power control and distribution systems  lighting systems and components  aircraft safety products  avionics databus solutions and test  training and simulation systems 
our strategy is to invest significantly in engineering  research and development to develop and maintain positions of technical leadership 
we expect to leverage those positions to increase our ship set content and grow the amount of content and volume of product we sell and to selectively acquire businesses with similar technical capabilities that could benefit from our leadership position and strategic direction 
the company operates in two reportable segments  aerospace and test systems 
our aerospace segment has six principal operating facilities located in new york state  two in washington state  new hampshire  florida and quebec  canada 
our test systems segment has one facility located in florida 
our aerospace segment serves four primary markets 
they are the military  commercial transport  business jet and faa airport markets 
we serve one primary market in the test systems segment  which is the military 
sales to the commercial transport market totaled approximately of our total revenue in our cabin electronics products which provide in seat power for airline passengers as well as power for in flight entertainment systems ife found on commercial airlines around the world accounted for the majority of our sales to this market 
since our sales to the commercial transport markets increased from approximately million to approximately million in in addition to supplying cabin electronics products to this market we also supply lighting products used in the cabin and cockpit of commercial airlines 
maintaining and growing our sales to the commercial transport market will depend on airlines capital spending budgets for cabin up grades as well as the purchase of new aircraft such as the boeing  airbus a and airbus a this spending by the airlines is impacted by their profits  cash flow and available financing as well as competitive pressures between the airlines to improve the travel experience for their passengers 
we expect that these new aircraft  once in production will be equipped with more ife and in seat power than previous generation aircraft 
additionally  our ability to maintain and grow sales to this market depends on our ability to maintain our technological advantages over our competitors and maintain our relationships with major in flight entertainment suppliers and global airlines 
sales to the military aerospace market include our aircraft lighting  airframe power and avionics databus products 
in  aerospace military sales represented approximately of consolidated sales 
the military market is dependent on governmental funding which can change from year to year 
risks are that overall spending may be reduced in the future  specific programs may be eliminated or that we fail to win new business through the competitive bid process 
astronics does not have significant reliance on any one program such that cancellation of a particular program will cause material financial loss 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities similar to past years regarding this market 
sales to the business jet market are primarily aircraft lighting and airframe power products 
sales to the business jet market accounted for approximately of our consolidated sales in sales to the business jet market are driven by our ship set content on new aircraft and build rates of new aircraft 
business jet oem build rates continue to be significantly impacted by slow global wealth creation and corporate profitability which have been negatively affected during the past several years by the slow recovery from the global recession 
our sales to the business jet market will continue to be challenged in the upcoming year as business jet aircraft production rates are not expected to increase during as the global economy continues to struggle 
additionally  there continues to be a large supply of high quality used aircraft in the market competing with new aircraft for customers 
despite the current market conditions  we continue to see opportunities on new aircraft currently in the design phase to employ our power and lighting technology in the business jet market 
there is 
table of contents risk involved in the development of any new aircraft including the risk that the aircraft will not ultimately be produced or that it will be produced in lower quantities than originally expected and thus impacting our return on our engineering and development efforts 
sales to the faa airport market account for approximately of our consolidated sales in and were comprised of sales of airfield lighting products including navigational lighting aids  providing design build lighting solutions to simplify lighting installation projects and provide seamless airfield upgrades for airports 
future faa airport market sales are dependent on funding availability for airport upgrades and successfully competing for those opportunities 
our test systems segment accounted for of our consolidated sales in  all to the military market 
important factors affecting our growth and profitability are the rate at which new aircraft are produced  government funding of military programs  our ability to have our products designed into the plans for new aircraft and the rates at which aircraft owners  including commercial airlines  refurbish or install upgrades to their aircraft 
new aircraft build rates and aircraft owners spending on upgrades and refurbishments is cyclical and dependant on the strength of the global economy 
once designed into a new aircraft  the spare parts business is frequently retained by the company 
each of the markets that we serve presents opportunities that we expect will provide growth for the company over the long term 
we continue to look for opportunities in all of our markets to capitalize on our core competencies to expand our existing business and to grow through strategic acquisitions 
challenges which continue to face us include improving shareholder value through increasing profitability 
increasing profitability is dependent on many things  primarily revenue growth and the company s ability to control operating expenses and to identify means of creating improved productivity 
revenue is driven by increased build rates for existing aircraft  market acceptance and economic success of new aircraft  continued government funding of defense programs  the company s ability to obtain production contracts for parts we currently supply or have been selected to design and develop for new aircraft platforms and continually identifying and winning new business for our test systems segment 
reduced aircraft build rates driven by a weak economy  tight credit markets  reduced air passenger travel and an increasing supply of used aircraft on the market will likely result in reduced demand for our products which will result in lower profits 
reduction of defense spending may result in fewer opportunities for us to compete  which could result in lower profits in the future 
many of our newer development programs are based on new and unproven technology and at the same time we are challenged to develop the technology on a schedule that is consistent with specific programs 
we will continue to address these challenges by working to improve operating efficiencies and focusing on executing on the growth opportunities currently in front of us 
acquisitions on november  we acquired of the stock of ballard technology  inc ballard a manufacturer of avionics databus products 
ballard is included in our aerospace reporting segment 
the addition of ballard diversifies the products and technologies that astronics offers 
we purchased the outstanding stock of ballard for approximately million in cash plus contingent purchase consideration up to a maximum of million subject to meeting certain revenue growth targets over the next five years 
the additional purchase consideration was recorded at its estimated fair value of approximately million at the date of acquisition based upon the company s assessment of the probability of ballard achieving the revenue growth targets 
acquisition purchase price allocation and pro forma information is provided in note of
