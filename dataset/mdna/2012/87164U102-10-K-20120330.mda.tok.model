item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december  found in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
where possible  we have tried to identify these forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  believe  intends  or similar expressions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors and risks including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors in part i  item a of this report 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the development of synthetic dna based therapeutics and innovative disease modifying medicines for serious illnesses 
our initial synthetic biologic product candidate is intended to treat pah  a serious life threatening lung disease  by locally delivering therapeutic dna to the lungs of pah patients and controlling long term expression of such dna via an oral daily pill 
we also intend to expand new and existing collaborations in the area of dna based therapeutics 
in addition  we have several small molecule clinical stage programs  the majority of which are being funded  or partially funded  by grants  charitable organizations and corporate partners 
in this area we are developing  or have partnered the development of  product candidates to treat relapsing remitting ms  cognitive dysfunction in ms  fibromyalgia and als 
synthetic biologics our initial synthetic biologic product candidate is intended to treat pah  a serious life threatening lung disease 
this product is designed to deliver dna that encodes a therapeutic protein called pgis locally to the pulmonary arteries of pah patients via a single procedure  and  via an oral daily pill  control the long term local expression of such therapeutic protein 
we are developing this initial product candidate pursuant a global exclusive channel collaboration that we entered into with the private synthetic biology company intrexon in november as part of this collaboration  we have access to intrexon s ultravector platform and rheoswitch therapeutic system for this product application 
we anticipate that by continuously producing and delivering prostacyclin directly where it is needed  in the pulmonary arteries of pah patients  this product candidate may overcome the dose limiting side effects of systemic prostacyclin treatments for pah  a mainstay of pah treatment 
according to globaldata  the global market for pah treatments is estimated to exceed billion by ultravector and rheoswitch therapeutic system are registered trademarks of intrexon corporation funded small molecule clinical programs trimesta tm oral estriol is being developed as an oral once daily treatment for relapsing remitting ms in women 
patient enrollment of patients is complete in this randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial being conducted at centers in the us patients are being dosed and monitored for two years 
this clinical trial is supported by grants exceeding million  which should be sufficient to fund the trial through completion 
current sales of injectable disease modifying therapies for ms are estimated at billion annually 
according to various reports  sales of oral disease modifying therapies for ms  of which trimesta  if and when approved  would be in such class  are anticipated to grow from million in to billion annually by trimesta tm oral estriol is also being developed for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in female ms patients 
in january  patient enrollment began in a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial being conducted at university of california  los angeles ucla 
the majority of the costs of this trial are being funded by grants from foundations and charitable organizations and we have pledged approximately  to ucla to partially fund this trial payable over three years 
an estimated of ms patients are expected to develop disabilities due to cognitive dysfunction and there is currently no approved treatment 
effirma tm flupirtine is being developed for the treatment of fibromyalgia 
on may   we entered into a sublicense agreement with meda ab  a multi billion dollar international pharmaceutical company  covering all of our patents rights on the use of flupirtine for fibromyalgia in the us  canada and japan 
according to meda s annual report  flupirtine for fibromyalgia is currently in phase ii development 
the sublicense agreement provides that all ongoing and future development costs are to borne by meda and we are entitled to receive certain payments if milestones are achieved and royalties on sales 
based on an estimated annual price of  per fibromyalgia patient  we estimate that the total market potential in the us is billion 
aen gastroretentive zinc acetate is being developed under an investigator initiated ind application for the treatment of als  also known as lou gehrig s disease 
we intend to sponsor a multi center  double blind  placebo controlled  adaptively designed phase ii iii clinical trial in als patients 
it is anticipated that the clinical trial will comprise two phases 
the first phase of the trial is anticipated to enroll at least patients randomized to receive either aen or placebo for a period of six months at which time the average change in functional rating between the groups will be compared via an interim analysis conducted on a blinded basis 
should the interim analysis meet the threshold criteria in favor of the treatment group  the second phase of the study will be initiated and will seek to enroll approximately additional subjects to receive treatment for nine months 
this study is intended to be conducted by pna which previously sponsored and completed a successful pilot phase i ii study of oral zinc therapy for als 
separately  pna intends to conduct a phase i study of aen in normal volunteers prior to initiating the phase ii iii clinical trial in als patients 
we have committed to support approximately  to pna for the first phase of the phase ii iii clinical trial study  payable based upon study enrollment and milestones 
there is only one approved therapy for als  the efficacy of which is considered to be marginal 
based on an estimated annual price of  per als patient  we estimate that the total market potential in the us is million 
on november   we entered into a channel agreement with intrexon that governs an exclusive channel collaboration arrangement in which we intend to use intrexon s technology directed towards the production of pgis  through the use of in vivo conditionally regulated embedded controllable bioreactors for the treatment of pah 
the channel agreement establishes committees comprised of our and intrexon representatives that will govern activities related to the pah program in the areas of project establishment  chemistry  manufacturing and controls  clinical and regulatory matters  commercialization efforts and intellectual property 
as partial consideration for execution of the channel agreement  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with intrexon pursuant to which we issued to intrexon a number of shares of our common stock equal to of the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding following and giving effect to such issuance the first tranche at a purchase price equal to the par value of such shares  which issuance was deemed paid in partial consideration for the execution and delivery of the channel agreement 
we also agreed to issue additional shares of our common stock to intrexon upon dosing of the first patient in a phase ii clinical trial sponsored by us in the us  or similar study as the parties may agree in a country other than the us on december   we announced that the board of directors had taken several actions to prioritize our focus on our entry into the emerging field of synthetic biology 
in connection with the change in business focus on march   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement  and certain related agreements  pursuant to which we sold all of our interest in the lab to hartlab  llc  an entity controlled by the lab s former owner  in consideration for i the immediate assignment of the lab s outstanding accounts receivable up through the date of closing  plus ii seven hundred thousand dollars  payable pursuant to the terms of a two year non recourse promissory note secured by all of the assets of the lab 
we also announced that we intend to seek marketing partners for our zinc based products reazin and wellzin 
on february   upon stockholder approval  we amended our articles of incorporation to change our name to synthetic biologics  inc our common stock continues trade on the nyse amex stock exchange  currently under the symbol syn 
prior to this time and since october   our name was adeona pharmaceuticals  inc and we traded on the nyse amex stock exchange under the symbol aen 
we are incorporated in the state of nevada 
we continue to maintain our principal executive offices in ann arbor  mi  and are currently located at research park drive  suite  ann arbor  mi effective as of june   we emerged from a development stage entity as defined by financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc on may   we entered into a sublicense agreement with meda ab of sweden 
this agreement provides that meda ab will assume all future development costs for the commercialization of oral flupirtine for fibromyalgia 
as consideration for such sublicense  we received an up front payment of million and are entitled to milestone payments of million upon filing of an nda with the fda of oral flupirtine for fibromyalgia and million upon marketing approval  plus royalties 
we consider the agreement with meda ab to be an indication that we have commenced our principal operations and therefore are not required to report as a development stage entity 
since our inception in january  our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our product candidates  our clinical trials  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
as of june   we emerged from the development stage after entering into a sublicense agreement with meda ab and receiving an up front payment of million 
we consider this sublicense agreement to be an indication that we have commenced our principal operations 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private sales of our common stock  and we expect to continue to seek to obtain the required capital in a similar manner 
we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december  we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all  obtain the required funding  obtain the required regulatory approvals  or complete additional corporate partnering or acquisition transactions 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from these estimates 
there are accounting policies that we believe are significant to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
the most significant accounting policies relate to stock based compensation  revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
stock based compensation calculating stock based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
we apply the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock options 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on historical volatility 
we estimate the expected life of our option using the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
the dividend rate is based on our historical rate  which we anticipate to remain at zero 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent our best estimates  however these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and different assumptions are used  the stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock options expected to vest over the service period 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following have occurred persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is completed without further obligation  the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize milestone payments or upfront payments that have no contingencies as revenue when payment is received 
our primary streams of revenue are license revenue and laboratory revenue 
license revenues our licensing agreements may contain multiple elements  such as non refundable up front fees  payments related to the achievement of particular milestones and royalties 
fees associated with substantive at risk performance based milestones are recognized as revenue upon completion of the scientific or regulatory event specified in the agreement 
when we have substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized over the performance period of the obligations using a time based proportional performance approach 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount of non contingent payments received or due 
when we have no substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize revenue as the related fees become due 
revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectability is reasonably assured 
laboratory revenues we primarily recognize revenue for services rendered upon completion of the testing process 
billing for services reimbursed by third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  are recorded as revenues  net of allowances for differences between amounts billed and the estimated receipts from such payers 
we maintain a sales allowance to compensate for the difference in our clinical laboratory s billing practices and insurance company reimbursements 
in determining this allowance  we look at several factors  the most significant of which is the average difference between the amount charged and the amount reimbursed by insurance carriers over the prior months  otherwise known as the yearly average adjustment amount 
the allowance taken is the averaged yearly average adjustment amount for these prior periods and multiplied by the period s actual gross sales to determine the actual sales allowance for each period 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported at realizable value  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded 
we estimate and review the collectability of our receivables based on a number of factors  including the period they have been outstanding 
historical collection and payer reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for doubtful accounts 
in addition  we regularly assess the state of our billing operations in order to identify issues  which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates 
revisions to the allowances for doubtful accounts estimates are recorded as an adjustment to bad debt expense within general and administrative expenses 
receivables deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts at the time such receivables are written off 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded as credits to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
results of operations year ended december  and revenues  net total net revenues for the year ended december  were million 
total net revenues consisted of million from the oral flupirtine sublicense fee with meda ab  which is net of the  payment to mclean hospital and  of grant revenues from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project qtdp program to support our clinical programs 
there were no net revenues reported for the year ended december   net laboratory revenues for this year are included in discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations of adeona clinical laboratory 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase of is primarily the result of increased salary expense  consultant fees and stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses also include a non cash charge relating to stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the stock based compensation expense for year ended december  includes a one time charge of  relating to the modification of certain stock options  prior to expiration  held by a member of the board of directors 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase of is primarily the result of recording the fair value million of the common stock issued to intrexon as consideration for the exclusive channel collaboration agreement 
this is a non cash charge 
research and development expenses also include a non cash charge relating to stock based compensation expense of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  other expense  net total net other expense was million compared to  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total net other expense for the year ended december   included million relating to the estimated fair value of the warrants associated with the january and april financings  adjusted for the change in their fair value for the year ended december  other income for the year ended december  included  relating to the settlement of accounts payable previously accrued in prior periods offset by other expenses of  and  of interest income from our short term investments 
total net other expense for the year ended december   included an impairment loss of  net loss from continuing operations our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  net loss from discontinued operations our net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december   was  or per common share compared to a  or per common share for the year ended december  on march   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement  and certain related agreements  pursuant to which we sold all of our interest in adeona clinical laboratory  llc the lab to hartlab  llc 
this resulted in the classification of the lab as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations of adeona clinical laboratory for summarized statement of operations data for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through proceeds from equity financings and various private financings  primarily involving private sales of our common stock and other equity securities  corporate partnering license fees and from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock under our registration statement on form s  laboratory revenues  miscellaneous equipment sales 
on january   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with institutional investors  relating to the offering and sale of  shares of common stock  par value per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
we raised gross proceeds of million  before estimated offering expenses of approximately  which includes placement agent fees 
on april   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an institutional investor  relating to the offering and sale of  shares of common stock  par value per share and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock 
we raised gross proceeds of million  before estimated offering expenses of approximately  which includes placement agent fees 
both of these offerings were made pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 which was declared effective by the sec on june  our cash totaled million at december   an increase of million from december  during the year ended december   the primary sources of cash were net proceeds from the issuances of common stock to institutional investors of million and stock option and warrant exercises of  the primary use of cash during the year ended december  was for working capital requirements 
our cash totaled million at december  the primary sources of cash were million from the sublicense fee relating to the meda agreement and proceeds from the issuance of common stock to a single investor of  net of offering costs of  and stock option exercises of  the primary uses of cash for the year ended december   included working capital requirements and  in capital equipment additions 
during the period from january  through march    warrants were exercised for gross proceeds of million 
as of march   our cash balance was approximately million 
our continued operations will primarily depend on whether we are able to generate revenues and profits through partnerships  joint ventures and or raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as license fees from a potential corporate partner  equity and debt financing 
such additional funds may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional funding that we do obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs in the long term 
we will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through the similar sources of capital previously described 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
current and future financing needs we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december  with the exception of the quarter ended june   we have incurred negative cash flow from operations since we started our business 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our planned product development efforts  our clinical trials  and our research and discovery efforts 
based on our current plans  we believe that our cash will be sufficient to enable us to meet our planned operating needs for at least the next months 
however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following the progress of our research activities  the number and scope of our research programs  the progress of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered into research and development agreements  our ability to maintain current research and development licensing arrangements and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements  our ability to achieve our milestones under licensing arrangements  the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  and profitability of our clinical laboratory diagnostic and microbiology services business 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
we may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate 
potential sources of financing include strategic relationships  public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long term capital requirements 
we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time  and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted 
if we are not able to obtain financing when needed  we may be unable to carry out our business plan 
as a result  we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed
