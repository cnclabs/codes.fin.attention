such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking 
the dodd frank act added the requirements that the holding company itself be well capitalized and well managed 
the company has not opted to become a financial holding company 
the federal reserve board has the power to order a holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity  or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary  when it has reasonable cause to believe that the continuation of such activity or such ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that holding company 
dividends 
the federal reserve board has the power to prohibit dividends by bank holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies  which expresses the federal reserve board s view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
the federal reserve board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a bank holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends 
under the prompt corrective action regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  the federal reserve board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company s bank subsidiary is classified as undercapitalized 
see regulation and supervision of the bank prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal reserve board has long had a policy under which bank holding companies are required to serve as a source of strength for their depository subsidiaries by providing capital  liquidity and other resources in times of financial distress 
the dodd frank act codified the source of strength doctrine and required the issuance of implementing regulations 
stock repurchases 
as a bank holding company  the company is required to give the federal reserve board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross 
table of contents consideration for the purchase or redemption  when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding months  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would violate any law  regulation  federal reserve board order  directive  or any condition imposed by  or written agreement with  the federal reserve board 
this requirement does not apply to bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and are not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues

in evaluating such transactions  the federal reserve board considers the financial and managerial resources of and future prospects of the companies involved  competitive factors and the convenience and needs of the communities to be served 
bank holding companies may acquire additional banks in any state  subject to certain restrictions such as deposit concentration limits 
with certain exceptions  the bank holding company act the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which  by statute or by federal reserve board regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bhca and the related federal reserve board regulations 
under the change in bank control act of the cbca  notice must be submitted to the federal reserve board if any person including a company  or any group acting in concert  seeks to acquire of any class of the company s outstanding voting securities  unless the federal reserve board determines that such acquisition will not result in a change of control of the bank

capital requirements 
the federal reserve board maintains guidelines regarding the capital adequacy of bank holding companies  which require bank holding companies to maintain on a consolidated basis  specified minimum ratios of capital to total assets and capital to risk weighted assets 
these requirements  which generally apply to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of million or more  are substantially similar to  but somewhat more generous than  those applicable to the bank 
see regulation and supervision of the bank capital requirements 
the dodd frank act required the federal reserve board to adopt consolidated capital requirements for holding companies that are equally as stringent as those applicable to the depository institution subsidiaries 
that means that certain instruments that had previously been includable in tier capital for bank holding companies  such as trust preferred securities  will no longer be eligible for inclusion 
the revised capital requirements are subject to certain grandfathering and transition rules

in addition to the leverage capital ratio  state chartered nonmember banks must maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least half must be tier capital 
qualifying total capital consists of tier capital plus tier capital also referred to as supplementary capital items 
tier capital items include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and preferred stock with a maturity of over years  certain other capital instruments and up to of pre tax net unrealized holding gains on equity securities

qualifying total capital is further reduced by the amount of the bank s investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for regulatory capital purposes  reciprocal cross holdings of capital securities issued by other banks  most intangible assets and certain other deductions 
under the fdic risk weighted system  all of a bank s balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk weight categories from to  based on the regulators perception of the risks inherent in the type of assets or item 
the aggregate dollar amount of each category is multiplied by the risk weight assigned to that category 
the sum of these weighted values equals the bank s risk weighted assets

insurance of deposit accounts 
under the fdic s risk based assessment system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors  with less risky institutions paying lower assessments 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
effective april   assessment rates ranged from seven to basis points 
on february   the fdic issued final rules  effective april   implementing changes to the assessment rules resulting from the dodd frank act 
initially  the base assessment rates will range from two and one half to basis points 
the rate schedules will automatically adjust in the future when the deposit insurance fund reaches certain milestones 
no institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment 
the fdic imposed on all insured institutions a special emergency assessment of five basis points of total assets minus tier capital  as of june   capped at ten basis points of an institution s deposit assessment base to cover losses to the deposit insurance fund 
that special assessment  in the amount of  was collected on september  in lieu of further special assessments  the fdic required insured institutions to prepay estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of through the fourth quarter of such amount was million for the bank 
the estimated assessments  which include an assumed annual assessment base increase of  were recorded as a prepaid expense asset as of december  as of december   and each quarter thereafter  a charge to earnings is recorded for each regular assessment with an offsetting credit to the prepaid asset 
due to the difficult economic conditions  deposit insurance per account owner was raised to  that limit was made permanent by the dodd frank act 
in addition  the fdic adopted an optional temporary liquidity guarantee program by which  for a fee  noninterest bearing transaction accounts would receive unlimited insurance coverage until december   with an additional extension to december   and certain senior unsecured debt issued by institutions and their holding companies between october  and june  would be guaranteed by the fdic through june   or in some cases  december  the bank initially elected to participate in the unlimited noninterest bearing transaction account coverage program  but opted out effective december  the bank and the company both participated in the unsecured debt guarantee program  but issued no debt under the program 
the dodd frank act adopted mandatory unlimited coverage for certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts from january  until december  the dodd frank act increased the minimum target deposit insurance fund ratio from of estimated insured deposits to of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic must seek to achieve the ratio by september  insured institutions with assets of billion or more are supposed to fund the increase 
the dodd frank act eliminated the maximum fund ratio  instead leaving it to the discretion of the fdic 

table of contents prompt corrective regulatory action 
the federal banking regulators are required to take prompt corrective action if an insured depository institution fails to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage limit  a risk based capital requirement and any other measure deemed appropriate by the federal banking regulators for measuring the capital adequacy of an insured depository institution 
all institutions  regardless of their capital levels  are restricted from making any capital distribution or paying any management fees if the institution would thereafter fail to satisfy the minimum levels for any of its capital requirements 
an institution that fails to meet the minimum level for any relevant capital measure an undercapitalized institution may be subject to increased monitoring by the appropriate federal banking regulator  required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan within days  subject to asset growth limits  and required to obtain prior regulatory approval for acquisitions  branching and new lines of businesses 
the capital restoration plan must include a guarantee by the institution s holding company that the institution will comply with the plan until it has been adequately capitalized on average for four consecutive quarters  under which the holding company would be liable up to the lesser of of the institution s total assets or the amount necessary to bring the institution into capital compliance as of the date it failed to comply with its capital restoration plan

at their discretion  the federal banking regulators may also impose the foregoing sanctions on an undercapitalized institution if the regulators determine that such actions are necessary to carry out the purposes of the prompt corrective provisions 
if an institution s ratio of tangible capital to total assets falls below the critically undercapitalized level established by law  ie  a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of or less  the institution will be subject to conservatorship or receivership within specified time periods 
tangible equity is defined as core capital plus cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus less all intangible assets other than qualifying supervisory goodwill and certain purchased mortgage servicing rights 
under the implementing regulations  the federal banking regulators generally measure an institution s capital adequacy on the basis of its total risk based capital ratio the ratio of its total capital to risk weighted assets  tier risk based capital ratio the ratio of its core capital to risk weighted assets and leverage ratio the ratio of its core capital to adjusted total assets 
the following table shows the capital ratios required for the various prompt corrective action categories 
well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier risk based capital ratio or more or more less than less than tier leverage ratio or more or more less than less than if institution has a composite camels rating 
the fdic may reclassify a well capitalized depository institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory actions applicable to institutions in the next lower capital category but may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized if the fdic determines  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  that the savings institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or that the institution has received and not corrected a less than satisfactory rating for any camels rating category

risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves various risks 
before deciding to invest in our common stock  you should carefully consider the risks described below in conjunction with the other information in this form k  including the items included as exhibits 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any of the following risks or by other risks that have not been identified or that we may believe are immaterial or unlikely 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and our actual results may differ substantially from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
our increased emphasis on commercial lending may expose us to increased lending risk 
at december   our loan portfolio consisted of million  or  of commercial real estate loans  million  or  of construction loans primarily commercial properties and million  or  of commercial and industrial loans and leases 
we intend to continue to maintain our emphasis on the origination of commercial loans 
however  these types of loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property  the income stream of the borrowers and  for construction loans  the accuracy of the estimate of the property s value at completion of construction and the estimated cost of construction 
commercial and construction loans typically involve larger loan balances compared to one to four family residential mortgage loans 
commercial and industrial loans expose us to additional risks since they typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayments from the cash flows of the borrower s business and are secured by non real estate collateral that may depreciate over time 
in addition  since such loans generally entail greater risk than one to four family residential mortgage loans  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses to account for the likely increase in probable incurred credit losses associated with the growth of such loans 
also  many of our commercial and construction borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us 
consequently  an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one to four family residential mortgage loan 

table of contents our nonperforming assets remain elevated and we may be required to increase our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future  each of which could adversely affect our results of operations 
further  our allowance for loan losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio 
for  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million 
we also recorded net loan charge offs of million 
the continued weakness of the economy has contributed to relatively high levels of loan delinquencies and other nonperforming assets as of december  our non performing loans totaled million  representing of total loans  at december  in addition  loans that we have classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss totaled million  representing of total loans  at december  if these loans do not perform according to their terms and the collateral is insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance  we may be required to add further reserves to our allowance for loan losses or we may experience loan losses  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date 
however  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially adversely affect our operating results 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including our historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and classified loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and estimated collateral values  to estimate the risk and amount of loss for those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments  competitive challenges and other factors 
because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change  our actual losses may vary from our current estimates 
at december   our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 
our regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense  or to decrease our allowance for loan losses by recognizing loan charge offs 
any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge offs  as required by these regulatory agencies  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a return to recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and or reduce demand for our products and services  which would lead to lower revenue  higher loan losses and lower earnings 
following a national home price peak in mid  falling home prices and sharply reduced sales volumes  along with the collapse of the united states subprime mortgage industry in early  significantly contributed to a recession that officially lasted until june  although the effects continued thereafter 
dramatic declines in real estate values and high levels of foreclosures resulted in significant asset write downs by financial institutions  which have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with other institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
concerns over the united states credit rating which was recently downgraded by standard poor s  the european sovereign debt crisis  and continued high unemployment in the united states  among other economic indicators  have contributed to increased volatility in the capital markets and diminished expectations for the economy 
a return of recessionary conditions and or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
further declines in real estate values and sales volumes and continued high unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies  increases in our levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for our products and services 
these negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital  liquidity  and financial condition 

table of contents our cost of operations is high relative to our assets 
our failure to maintain or reduce our operating expenses costs could hurt our profits 
our operating expenses  which consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  furniture and equipment expense  professional fees  data processing expense  fdic insurance premiums and assessments  and marketing  totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  we continue our concerted effort to effectively manage our expenses 
our efficiency ratio totaled for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  failure to control our expenses could hurt future profits 
changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings 
our net interest income is the interest we earn on loans and investment less the interest we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our interest rate spread is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and our other sources of funding 
changes in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and  as a result  our net interest income and net interest margin 
although the yield we earn on our assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one can rise or fall faster than the other  causing our net interest margin to expand or contract 
our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates rise  our funding costs may rise faster than the yield we earn on our assets  causing our net interest margin to contract until the yield catches up 
changes in the slope of the yield curve or the spread between short term and long term interest rates could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  meaning short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
changes in interest rates can also affect our ability to originate loans  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to obtain and retain deposits in competition with other investment alternatives  and the ability of our borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans 
the building of market share through our branching strategy could cause our expenses to increase faster than revenues 
we opened a full service banking center in fishers  indiana in october  a second banking center in carmel in december and a third in westfield in may we also purchased property in plainfield in with the expectation to begin construction on a new full service banking center  but those plans were put on hold until it is determined that the economy and other conditions warrant the required investment 
there are considerable costs involved in opening branches and new branches generally require a period of time to generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs  especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence 
accordingly  any new branch can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until the branch reaches certain economies of scale 
recently enacted regulatory reform may have a material impact on our operations 
on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in these include provisions strengthening holding company capital requirements  requiring retention of a portion of the risk of securitized loans and regulating debit card interchange fees 
the dodd frank act also created a new federal agency to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws  a function that is now performed by the depository institution regulators 
the full impact of the dodd frank act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted 
the dodd frank act may have a material impact on our operations  particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs 
in addition to the enactment of the dodd frank act  the federal regulatory agencies recently have begun to take stronger supervisory actions against financial institutions that have experienced increased loan losses and other weaknesses as a result of the recent economic crisis 
the actions include the entering into written agreements and cease and desist orders that place certain limitations on their operations 
federal bank regulators recently have also been using with more frequency their ability to impose individual minimal capital requirements on banks  which requirements may be higher than those imposed under the dodd frank act or which would otherwise qualify the bank as being well capitalized under the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
if we were to become 
table of contents subject to a supervisory agreement or higher individual capital requirements  such action may have a negative impact on our ability to execute our business plan  as well as our ability to grow  pay dividends or engage in mergers and acquisitions and may result in restrictions in our operations 
increased and or special fdic assessments will hurt our earnings 
the recent economic recession has caused a high level of bank failures  which has dramatically increased fdic resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the balance of the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  the fdic has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance 
increases in the base assessment rate have increased our deposit insurance costs and negatively impacted our earnings 
in addition  in may  the fdic imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions 
our special assessment  which was reflected in earnings for the quarter ended june   was  in lieu of imposing an additional special assessment  the fdic required all institutions to prepay their assessments for all of  and  which for us totaled million 
additional increases in the base assessment rate or additional special assessments would negatively impact our earnings 
we may not be able to realize the full value of our deferred tax asset 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities  coupled with unused tax credits and tax benefits from operating loss carryforwards 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was million 
the net deferred tax asset was composed of approximately million of tax benefit from both state and federal net operating loss carryforwards  approximately million of tax benefit from temporary differences between book and tax income and an unused federal tax credit of million  reduced by a valuation allowance of million 
we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences  as well as tax strategies available to expedite the use of both the deferred state tax asset and the deferred federal tax asset 
realization of our deferred tax asset ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient future taxable income 
we currently expect that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax asset at december  will be fully realizable based on our expected future earnings 
realization of our deferred tax asset would significantly improve our earnings and capital through a related reversal of the current valuation allowance 
any reduction in the corporate tax rate for federal or state income taxes would immediately result in partial impairment of the book value of the deferred tax asset  and require a write down that would be charged against earnings in the year of the enactment of the related tax law 
strong competition within our market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and has occasionally forced us to offer higher deposit rates 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which reduces net interest income 
competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits 
according to the fdic  as of june   we held of the deposits in henry county  indiana  which was the largest market share of deposits out of the six financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also held of the deposits in hancock county  indiana  which was the fourth largest market share of deposits out of the ten financial institutions that held deposits in this county 
we also maintain offices in four other counties in which we held between and of the deposits in those counties as of june  some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
technological advances  for example  have lowered barriers to entry  allowed banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and made it possible for non depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks 
changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks  securities firms and insurance companies  which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry 
competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit the company s growth in the future 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area 

table of contents we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the indiana department of financial institutions  its chartering authority  and by the fdic  as insurer of its deposits 
the company is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage  and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and for the depositors and borrowers of the bank 
the regulation and supervision by the indiana department of financial institutions and the fdic are not intended to protect the interests of investors in the company s common stock 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
the trading history of our common stock is characterized by low trading volume 
our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
although our common stock trades on the nasdaq global market  it has not been regularly traded 
we cannot predict whether a more active trading market in our common stock will occur or how liquid that market might become 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time  which presence is dependent upon the individual decisions of investors  over which we have no control 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to numerous factors  including  but not limited to  the factors discussed in other risk factors and the following actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in interest rates  changes in the legal or regulatory environment in which we operate  press releases  announcements or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in our industry  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts and investors  future sales of our common stock  changes in economic conditions in our marketplace  general conditions in the us economy  financial markets or the banking industry  and other developments affecting our competitors or us 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance  and could prevent you from selling your common stock at or above the price you desire 
in addition  the stock markets  from time to time  experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our trading performance 
failure to comply with the restrictions and conditions in the resolutions adopted by our board at the request of our regulators could result in additional enforcement action against us 
on september   the board of directors of the bank adopted a resolution agreeing to higher capital requirements  requirements to reduce the level of our classified and criticized assets and restrictions on dividend payments 
on july   following a joint examination by and discussions with the fdic and the indiana department of financial institutions  the board of directors of the bank adopted a resolution with the same requirements  except for an additional increase in the tier leverage ratio to 
these restrictions may impede our ability to operate our business 

table of contents additionally  on december   the board of directors of the company  at the request of the federal reserve bank of chicago  adopted a resolution requiring the board to obtain the approval of the federal reserve bank at least thirty days before taking any of the following actions the payment of corporate dividends  the payment of interest on trust preferred securities  any increase in debt or issuance of trust preferred obligations the request for approval should include a written debt service plan indicating how payments will be made without causing further strain on ameriana bank s capital position  and the redemption of ameriana bancorp stock 
the resolution will remain in effect until the federal reserve bank authorizes the board to rescind the resolution 
if we fail to comply with the terms and conditions of the board resolutions  our regulators could take enforcement action against us  including the imposition of further operating restrictions 
these enforcement actions could take the form of a memorandum of understanding or a cease and desist order 
any informal or formal enforcement action could harm our reputation and our ability to retain or attract customers or employees and impact the trading price of our common stock 
we may require additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when it is needed 
we anticipate that we have adequate capital for the foreseeable future 
however  we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our continued growth or if we incur significant loan or securities impairment 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth could be materially impaired 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and indiana law  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and the corporate law of the state of indiana could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that shareholders may act on at shareholder meetings 
in addition  we are subject to indiana laws  including one that prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of five years from the date the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors

table of contents financial challenges and expansion in recent years to diversify the balance sheet and provide new avenues for loan and deposit growth  the bank further expanded into indianapolis  adding three full service offices in and in the suburban markets of carmel  fishers and westfield 
as a result  half of the banking centers are located in indianapolis 
these banking centers are focused on generating commercial lending and relationship business  where significant opportunities exist to win market share from smaller institutions lacking capital strength and resources  and large institutions that have concentrated on large business customers 
although the expansion strategy initially negatively affected earnings  the bank s expansion into new markets is critical for its long term sustainable growth 
additional expansion in indianapolis  including construction of a new full service banking center in plainfield on property purchased by the bank in early  was put on hold primarily due to the economic environment 
the economic climate became progressively difficult through most of  as the world wide financial crisis reached a peak in the second half of the year  and the subsequent economic recovery moved slowly through the severity of this environment and its consequences to the industry created many new formidable challenges for bankers 
executive overview of the company recorded net income of million  or per share  for  compared to net income of  or per share  for the results for reflected an improvement in net interest income  but the bank continued to be negatively impacted by high credit costs related to weak economic conditions  which were partly offset by gains realized on sales of investment securities

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  and such estimates and assumptions are integral to the understanding of reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each quarter based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 
the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for commercial loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and an analysis of the migration of commercial loans and actual loss experience 
the allowance recorded for noncommercial loans is based on an analysis of loan mix  risk characteristics of the portfolio  fraud loss and bankruptcy experiences and historical losses  adjusted for current trends  for each loan category or group of loans 
the allowance for loan losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans  or the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the subjective nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger  nonhomogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogenous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer allowance levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights msrs associated with loans originated and sold  where servicing is retained  are capitalized and included in other intangible assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
the value of the capitalized servicing rights represents the present value of the future servicing fees arising 
table of contents from the right to service loans in the portfolio 
critical accounting policies for msrs relate to the initial valuation and subsequent impairment tests 
the methodology used to determine the valuation of msrs requires the development and use of a number of estimates  including anticipated principal amortization and prepayments of that principal balance 
events that may significantly affect the estimates used are changes in interest rates  mortgage loan prepayment speeds and the payment performance of the underlying loans 
the carrying value of the msrs is periodically reviewed for impairment based on a determination of fair value 
impairment  if any  is recognized through a valuation allowance and is recorded as amortization of intangible assets 
valuation measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
investment securities and residential mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value  as defined by fasb fair value guidance  which requires key judgments affecting how fair value for such assets and liabilities is determined 
in addition  the outcomes of valuations have a direct bearing on the carrying amounts for goodwill and intangible assets 
to determine the values of these assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  management makes assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could affect the company s results of operations 
income tax accounting 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on our deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
under us gaap  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning our evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  our forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes any cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december  and december   we determined that our existing valuation allowance was adequate  largely based on available tax planning strategies and our projections of future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
any required increase to the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of an uncertain tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
differences between our position and the position of tax authorities could result in a reduction of a tax benefit or an increase to a tax liability  which could adversely affect our future income tax expense 
we believe our tax policies and practices are critical accounting policies because the determination of our tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we believe our tax liabilities and assets are adequate and are properly recorded in the consolidated financial statements at december

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents the current period credit or cost associated with maintaining an appropriate allowance for loan losses 
periodic fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  assessment by management  third parties and banking regulators of the quality of the loan portfolio  the value of the underlying collateral on problem loans and the general economic conditions in our market area 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we had a provision for loan losses of million for compared to a provision of million for the provisions for both and reflected elevated levels of nonperforming loans and charge offs  and the continuing pressure of current economic conditions on credit quality

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
this requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or at the same rate as changes in the prices of goods and services  which are directly affected by inflation  although interest rates may fluctuate in response to perceived changes in the rate of inflation
