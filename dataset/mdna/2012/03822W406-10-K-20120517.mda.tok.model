item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  we remain active in the storage industry with our design and sale of embedded storage computing chips and gigabit connectivity solutions with our embedded computing products 
we intend to continue working closely with leaders in the storage  networking and computing industries to design and develop new and enhanced storage connectivity products 
we believe that establishing strategic relationships with technology partners is essential to ensure that we continue to design and develop competitive products that integrate well with solutions from other leading participants in the storage markets 
our products incorporate a combination of internally developed and licensed technologies 
for certain of our embedded and server processor products  we are a licensee of arm s bit cores and their bit architecture 
we also license various other technology components used in our products  as well as various engineering design and verification tools 
research and development our research and development r d expertise and efforts are focused on the development of high performance analog  digital and mixed signal ics and on the development of highly integrated embedded processing soc ics for the communications market 
we also develop high performance libraries and design methodologies that are optimized for each of these applications 
our primary r d facilities are located in sunnyvale  san diego and santa clara  california  austin  texas and andover  massachusetts in the united states  ottawa in canada  ho chi minh city in vietnam  pune and bangalore in india and copenhagen in denmark 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  we expended million  million and million  respectively  on r d activities 
our ic product development is focused on building high performance  high complexity digital and analog intensive designs that are incorporated into well documented blocks that can be reused for multiple products 
we have made and will continue to make significant investments in advanced design tools to leverage the efforts of our engineering staff 
our product development is driven by the imperatives of reducing design cycle time  increasing first time design correctness  adhering to disciplined  well documented design processes and continuing to be responsive to customer needs 
we are also developing high performance final assembly packages for our products in collaboration with our packaging suppliers and our customers 
our printed circuit board assembly pcba development efforts are focused on building advanced telecom computing architecture atca evaluation boards and software for our switch fabric  network processors and embedded power architecture processors for the communications market 
before a new product is developed  our r d engineers work with marketing managers and customers to develop a comprehensive requirements specification 
after the product is designed and commercially released  our engineers continue to work with customers on early design in efforts to understand requirements for future generations and upgrades 
the company and veloce technologies  inc veloce are parties to a development agreement  dated as of may   as amended on november  and july  the development agreement  pursuant to which veloce has agreed to perform product development work for the company on an exclusive basis for up to five years for cash and other consideration  including a warrant to purchase shares of the company s common stock which was scheduled to vest in quarterly increments through december a portion of the vested 
table of contents warrant has been committed to be distributed to the employees of veloce and will be settled in cash instead of common stock 
therefore  the company has recognized stock based compensation expense in r d expense and recorded a corresponding liability for this distribution in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the warrant was vested as of march  pursuant to the development agreement  the company is paying veloce million per quarter for up to twelve consecutive quarters in order to assist veloce in meeting its expenses to perform its obligations under the agreement 
in july  the company agreed to pay veloce an additional million over four quarters to cover certain increased expenses under the development agreement 
these additional payments started in july and will end in the quarter ending june   or earlier in the event the company acquires veloce 
the company recognizes the payments as research and development expenses when such operating costs have been incurred by veloce 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  the company recognized million  million and million of costs incurred by veloce as research and development expense  respectively 
as of march   the company proposed to acquire veloce in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of may   as amended by amendment no 
to the agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of november   and collectively referred to as the original merger agreement 
under the original merger agreement  the company agreed to acquire veloce if certain performance milestones and delivery schedules set forth therein are achieved 
should the company acquire veloce pursuant to the original merger agreement  the purchase price payable by the company was estimated to be in the range of approximately million up to approximately million 
the final price would be based upon the achievement and timing of multiple product development and milestones  as adjusted based upon actual technical performance results 
for accounting purposes  veloce is a variable interest entity vie of which the company is the primary beneficiary 
upon entering into the development agreement and the original merger agreement  the consolidated financial statements of the company have included all of the accounts of veloce for all fiscal years presented 
on april  the original merger agreement was amended second amendment 
pursuant to the second amendment  the closing of the company s acquisition of veloce was set to occur upon achievement of a specified fpga product development milestone by veloce and the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions and consummation of certain other transactions contemplated by the second amendment  and the purchase price was modified to be in the range of million up to approximately million  based upon the achievement and timing of product development milestones and technical performance results as described above 
the merger is currently expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal in september  we completed the acquisition of tpack  a denmark based company which specializes in the development and sale of otn chips that are based on fpgas  which enables appliedmicro to expand its presence and customer relationships in the otn and carrier ethernet markets 
manufacturing manufacturing of integrated circuits the manufacturing of ics requires a combination of competencies in advanced silicon technologies  package design and manufacturing and high speed test and characterization 
we have obtained access to advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos manufacturing technology through foundry relationships 
we have substantial experience in the development and use of plastic and ceramic packages for high performance applications 
the selection of the optimal package solution is a vital element of the delivery of high performance products and involves balancing cost  size  thermal management and technical performance 
we purchase our ceramic and plastic packages from several vendors including advanced semiconductor engineering ase  siliconware precision industries co ltd 
spil  ibm  kyocera  unimicron and ntk 

table of contents wafer fabrication we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our products are made 
we use external foundries such as ibm  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation tsmc and united microelectronics corporation umc for the majority of our production of silicon wafers 
subcontracting our manufacturing requirements eliminates the high fixed cost of owning and operating a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility and enables us to focus our resources on design of ics and applications where we believe we have greater core competencies and competitive advantages 
assembly and testing our wafer probe and other product testing are conducted at independent test subcontractors 
after wafer testing is complete  the majority of our products are sent to multiple subcontractors for assembly  predominately located in asia 
following assembly  the devices are tested at subcontractors and returned to us ready for shipment to our customers 
certain of these services are available from a limited number of sources and lead times are occasionally extended 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to develop strong  engineering intensive relationships with the customer design teams for the creation of market leading platforms 
we maintain close working relationships with these customers so our marketing team can focus on identifying and developing new products that will meet their needs in the future  involving us in the early stages of our customers plans to design new equipment 
we sell our products both directly and through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and distributors 
our direct sales force is technically trained 
expert technical support is critical to our customers success and we provide such support through our field applications engineers  technical marketing team and engineering staff  as well as through our extranet technical support web site 
we augment this strategic account sales approach with domestic and foreign distributors that service some of our accounts purchasing standard ics 
typically  these distributors handle a wide variety of products  including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers 
we use marketing programs to augment the distribution effort to reach many of our customers 
most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection and stock rotation of unsold merchandise 
our sales headquarters is located in sunnyvale  california 
we maintain sales offices throughout the world 
net revenues generated from each category of our products as well as information regarding net revenue generated from each of our significant customers and a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of products 
quantities of our products to be delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in customers needs  customer orders generally can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
for these reasons  our backlog as of any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period and therefore  we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future revenue trends 
competition in the connectivity communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as broadcom  pmc sierra  cortina and vitesse 
in the embedded computing communications ic market  we compete with technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  cavium and intel 
in addition  some of our customers and potential customers have internal ic designs or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 

table of contents the communications ic market is highly competitive and is subject to rapid technological change 
the nature of the communications ic market is that design cycles are often measured in years 
as such  an ic supplier s timing of delivery to market is critical since once an ic supplier s product is designed into a customer s products  the ic supplier can often enjoy sales of the product for several years 
conversely  if a supplier misses a design cycle or develops an uncompetitive product  the supplier may never generate significant revenues from the product 
we typically face competition at the design stage when our customers are selecting which components to use in their next generation device and equipment products 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for the markets we serve include product performance  quality  reliability  integration  price and time to market  as well as our engineering expertise  reputation and level of customer support 
our ability to successfully compete in these markets depends on our ability to design and subcontract the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies and gain end market acceptance in a time efficient and cost effective manner 
proprietary rights we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property ip 
we have been issued approximately patents  which principally cover certain aspects of the design and architecture of our ic and enterprise storage products 
in addition  we have over inventions in various stages of the patenting process in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that if challenged  will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our ip  we also rely on a combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
as a general matter  the semiconductor and enterprise storage industries are characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other ip rights 
in the past we have been  and in the future may be  notified that we may be infringing on the ip rights of third parties 
in some cases  the third parties have demanded that we pay significant patent license fees in order to avoid litigation asserting ip infringement  to date  we have refused to enter into any such patent license agreements 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party ip rights by our products 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the ip rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
any limitations on our ability to market our products  any delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals that were used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior 
table of contents discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain remediation efforts at the omega chemical corporation site and the surrounding groundwater acquifers  which efforts are ongoing

risk factors 
risk factors before deciding to invest in us or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this annual report and in our other filings with the sec 
we update our descriptions of the risks and uncertainties facing us in our periodic reports filed with the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment 
if we are unable to timely develop new products or new generations and versions of our existing products to replace our current products  our operating results and competitive position will be materially harmed 
our industry is characterized by intense competition  rapidly evolving technology and continually changing customer requirements 
these factors could render our existing products obsolete 
accordingly  our ability to compete in the future will depend in large part on our ability to identify and develop new products or new generations and versions of our existing products that achieve market acceptance on a timely and cost effective basis  and to respond to changing requirements 
if we are unable to do so  our business  operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected 
the successful development and market acceptance of our products depend on a number of factors  including  but not limited to our accurate prediction of changing customer requirements  timely development of new designs  timely qualification and certification of our products for use in electronic systems  continued availability on commercially reasonable terms of the technology components and tools licensed from third parties  commercial acceptance and production of the electronic systems into which our products are incorporated  availability  quality  price  performance  and size of our products relative to competing products and technologies  our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness  successful development of relationships with existing and potential new customers  successful development of relationships with key developers of advanced digital semiconductors  changes in technology and industry standards  and rapidly changing consumer preferences 
we have in recent years devoted substantial engineering and financial resources to designing  developing and rolling out new products and technologies  including without limitation our product development arrangement with veloce  discussed in more detail below  and the recent introduction of several new products in our connectivity and computing business units 
however  there can be no assurance that veloce s product development efforts will be successful see additional risk factor below or that the other products and technologies we have recently developed and which we are currently developing will achieve market acceptance 
if these products and technologies fail to achieve market acceptance  or if we are unable to continue developing 
table of contents new products and technologies that achieve market acceptance  our business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  for our x gene tm and other server processor products  we are a licensee of the arm v bit architecture  and will depend upon the continuing timely completion and delivery by arm of various updates and other deliverables under the license agreement 
any failure or material delay by arm in completing its deliverables to us under the license could adversely affect our product development arrangement with veloce and other planned server processor products that utilize the arm bit architecture 
our agreements with and significant investment in veloce may not result in the successful development of new technologies or products 
as part of our product development efforts  in november we amended our development agreement with veloce pursuant to which veloce agreed to perform certain arm v compliant processor development work for us on an exclusive basis 
as compensation for such development work  veloce is receiving cash and other consideration  including a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock  which will vest quarterly through december we also provided veloce a million loan which is being forgiven in equal installments over eight quarters starting on march  pursuant to the development agreement  as amended  we are paying veloce million per quarter for up to twelve consecutive quarters in order to assist veloce in meeting its expenses to perform its obligations under the agreement 
in july  we agreed to pay veloce an additional million over the next four quarters to cover certain increased expenses under the agreement 
these additional payments started in july and will end in the quarter ending june  these amounts have increased in the past and may change again in the future 
we also paid  and will likely do so again  certain product development and manufacturing expenses incurred by veloce 
under a merger agreement we entered into with veloce in may  as amended in november and april  we agreed to acquire veloce if certain performance milestones and delivery schedules set forth under the merger agreement are achieved 
as amended  the merger agreement provides for us to complete our acquisition of veloce upon its achievement of a specified fpga product development milestone and the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions 
it is currently anticipated that the fpga milestone and other closing conditions will be satisfied  and that our acquisition of veloce will be completed  in june should we acquire veloce pursuant to the merger agreement  as currently amended  the purchase price is estimated to be in the range of million up to approximately million  depending upon the achievement and timing of multiple product development milestones and technical performance results 
at this time the eventual outcome is not determinable and as such we are unable to provide a narrower range for the estimated total merger consideration 
we will update the range in the future when additional relevant information is available 
even if we successfully complete the acquisition of veloce as described above  we may fail to appropriately integrate the operations of veloce into the company 
although we have spent considerable time and resources in the developmental effort  eventually veloce may be unsuccessful in developing the products that are described in the development and merger agreements  in which case our investment in veloce would not bear any significant value to our business and financial results and condition 
we face intense competition and price pressure 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive 
we expect competition to continue to increase as our industry and our competitors evolves and develop 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories and presences in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do  and in some cases operate their own fabrication facilities 
these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
we also face competition from newly established competitors  suppliers of products  and customers who choose to develop their own semiconductor solutions 

table of contents existing or new competitors may develop technologies that more effectively address our markets with products that offer enhanced features and functionality  lower power requirements  greater levels of integration or lower cost 
increased competition also has resulted in and is likely to continue to result in increased expenditures on research and development  declining average selling prices  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in certain markets 
these factors in turn create increased pressure to consolidate 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against current or new competitors 
if we do not compete successfully  we may lose market share in our existing markets and our revenues may fail to increase or may decline 
we and our customers face intense price pressure from competition from companies in lower cost countries like china 
in response to these price pressures  our customers could require us to reduce prices which could impact our financial results adversely 
these price pressures could cause our customers and us to not be competitive and lose significant revenues 
furthermore  our discrete legacy products are being and could continue to be integrated into asics that could cause our revenues from such products to decline at a faster rate 
our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that our cost of materials will be higher than expected 
we depend upon third parties to manufacture  assemble  package or test certain of our products 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with these third parties  including reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs  ability to attract and retain key personnel and to maintain knowledge base  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  potential lack of adequate capacity at the foundry during periods of excess demand  resulting in significant increases in lead time requirements and production delays  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventory charges due to the higher level of inventories in response to the increased lead times  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices  potential instability and business disruption in countries where third party manufacturers are located  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our outside foundries generally manufacture our products on a purchase order basis  and we have few long term supply arrangements with these suppliers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
a manufacturing disruption or capacity constraint experienced by one or more of our outside foundries or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry  including discontinuance of our products by that foundry  would negatively impact the production of certain of our products for a substantial period of time 
as our third party manufacturing suppliers extend their lead time requirements  we will likely need to also extend our lead time requirements to our customers 
this could cause our customers to lower their competitive assessment of us as a supplier and  as a result  we may not be considered for future design awards 
our ic products are generally only qualified for production at a single foundry 
these suppliers can allocate  and in the past have allocated  capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
there is also the potential that they may discontinue manufacturing our products or go out 
table of contents of business 
because establishing relationships  designing or redesigning ics  and ramping production with new outside foundries may take over a year  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for these products 
difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our ic products 
the process technology of an outside foundry is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between us and our manufacturer 
this risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls 
these risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
if the foundries or subcontractors we use to manufacture our products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade their technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers  which could materially adversely affect our operating results and harm our reputation 
the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies at one or more of our outside foundries could be unsuccessful or delayed 
our requirements typically represent a very small portion of the total production of the third party foundries 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce our parts 
we cannot assure you that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of parts for our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs  lower our gross margin  cause us to hold more inventories or materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time 
as our volumes decrease with any third party foundry  the likelihood of unfavorable pricing increases 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
natural disasters in certain regions  such as japan and thailand  could adversely affect our manufacturing and supply chain which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 
the occurrence of natural disasters in certain regions  such as the earthquake and tsunami in japan and flooding in thailand  could negatively impact our manufacturing and supply chain  our ability to deliver products  on a timely basis or at all  to our customers  the cost of our products  and the demand for our products 
the occurrence of natural disasters could also cause delays in our customers supply chains  causing them to delay their requirements for our products until they resolve shortages from their other suppliers 
any such occurrences of natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry computing technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and  as a result  may experience reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
as smaller line width geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality into our ic products and to transition our ic products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and will require us and our foundries to migrate to new manufacturing processes for our products 
we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance  and we have designed ic products to be manufactured at as little as 
micron geometry processes 
we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies and new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
the transition to smaller geometries is inherently more expensive and as we manufacture more products using smaller geometries  the incremental costs could have an adverse impact on our earnings 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our ic products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if we or our foundries experience significant delays in this transition or fail to implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the gross margins for our products could decrease rapidly or not increase as forecasted  which will negatively impact our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
the gross margins for our solutions have historically declined over time 
factors that we expect to cause downward pressure on the gross margins for our products include competitive pricing pressures  the cost sensitivity of our customers  particularly in the higher volume markets  new product introductions by us or our competitors  the overall mix of our products sold during a particular quarter  and other factors 
from time to time  for strategic reasons  we may accept orders at less than optimal gross margins in order to facilitate the introduction of new products or the market penetration of existing products 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to offset any reduction in gross margins of our products by reducing costs  increasing sales volume  developing and introducing new products and developing new generations and versions of existing products on a timely basis 
if the gross margins for our products decline or not increase as anticipated and we are unable to offset those reductions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
the current economic circumstances and uncertain political conditions could harm our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the economies of the united states and other developed or developing countries appear to be slowly emerging from an economic downturn 
we cannot predict whether this economic recovery will continue or reverse course 
the recent downturn has caused a decline in our near term revenues and it will take some time for our near term revenues to return to their previous levels 
our current operating plans are based on assumptions concerning levels of consumer and corporate spending 
if weak global and domestic economic and market conditions persist or deteriorate  we may experience further material impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
if economic conditions worsen  we may have to implement additional cost reduction measures or delay certain r d spending  which may adversely impact our ability to introduce new products and technologies 

table of contents we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
our portfolio primarily includes fixed income securities  mutual funds and preferred stock  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
the deterioration of these market prices has had an unfavorable impact on our portfolio and has caused us to record impairment charges to our earnings 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we did not record any other than temporary impairment charges while during the fiscal year ended march  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million 
if market prices continue to decline or securities continue to be in a loss position over time  we may recognize additional impairments in the fair value of our investments 
adverse economic and market conditions could also harm our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business  including our business partners  our customers and our suppliers 
these conditions could impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased from us 
as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable from our customers may increase 
in addition  our suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could negatively affect their operations and their ability to supply us with the parts we need to manufacture our products 
we have invested  and will continue to invest  in privately held companies  most of which can still be considered to be in startup or developmental stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose all or substantially all of the value of our investments in these companies and  in some cases  we have lost all or substantially all of the value of our investment in such entities 
our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of research analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect our quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult to control or predict  are communications  information technology and semiconductor industry conditions  fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  including as a result of slowing demand for our products or our customers products or over ordering or double booking of our products or our customers products  changes in the mix of products that our customers buy  the gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our ability to introduce  certify and deliver new products and technologies on a timely basis  the announcement or introduction of new products and technologies by our competitors  competitive pressures on selling prices  the ability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  fluctuations in manufacturing output  yields or other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products or our customers products  disasters that could affect our supply chain or our customers supply chain  increases in the costs of products or discontinuance of products by our suppliers  
table of contents the availability of external foundry capacity  contract manufacturing services  purchased parts and raw materials including packaging substrates  the availability of package and test vendor capacity  problems or delays that we and our foundries may face in shifting the design and manufacture of our future generations of ic products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design and device integration  the amounts and timing of meeting the specifications and expense recovery on non recurring engineering projects  the amounts and timing of costs associated with warranties and product returns  the amounts and timing of investments in r d  the product lifecycle and recoverability of capitalized architectural licenses  technology access fees and mask sets  the amounts and timing of the costs associated with payroll taxes related to stock option exercises or settlement of restricted stock units  costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact of potential one time charges related to purchased intangibles  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact on interest income of a significant use of our cash for an acquisition  stock repurchase or other purpose  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit worthiness on the value and yield of our short term investment portfolio  costs associated with compliance with applicable environmental  other governmental or industry regulations including costs to redesign products to comply with those regulations or lost revenue due to failure to comply in a timely manner  the effects of changes in accounting standards  costs associated with litigation  including without limitation  attorney fees  litigation judgments or settlements  relating to the use or ownership of intellectual property or other claims arising out of our operations  our ability to identify  hire and retain senior management and other key personnel  the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in logistics and security arrangements  and global economic and industry conditions 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed if we do not achieve anticipated revenues 
we can have revenue shortfalls for a variety of reasons  including shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to their other customers  which may disrupt our ability to meet our production obligations  our customers may experience shortages from their suppliers that may cause them to delay orders or deliveries of our products  delays in the availability of our products or our customers products  
table of contents delays in the availability of the software elements from third party vendors that may cause delays in customers using our hardware products resulting in further delays of bringing our product to market  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  declines in the average selling prices of our products  delays when our customers are transitioning from old products to new products  a decrease in demand for our products or our customers products  a decline in the financial condition or liquidity of our customers or their customers  the failure of our products to be qualified in our customers systems or certified by our customers  excess inventory of our products held by our customers  resulting in a reduction in their order patterns as they work through the excess inventory of our products  fabrication  test  product yield  or assembly constraints for our products that adversely affect our ability to meet our production obligations  the failure of one or more of our subcontract manufacturers to perform its obligations to us  our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  and global economic and industry conditions 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
because we do not have substantial non cancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
customer orders for our products typically have non standard lead times  which make it difficult for us to predict revenues and plan inventory levels and production schedules 
if we are unable to plan inventory levels and production schedules effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside contract manufacturers  suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering has in the past resulted and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize  or other factors render our products less marketable 
if we are forced to hold excess inventory or we incur unanticipated inventory write downs  our financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
changes to production volumes and impact of overhead absorption may result in a decline in our financial condition or liquidity 
our business is dependent on the pace of recovery of the communications industry 
we are currently seeing certain signs that would indicate to us that we can expect the slowdown in our connectivity business to reverse in the near future 
it is possible that our estimations are incorrect and that it will take longer for the reversal of the slowdown to occur  or that our estimated market share in the connectivity space is in fact much lower than we anticipate 
our liquidity may deteriorate on our future uses of cash although we currently believe we have adequate liquidity to operate normally  our cash balances could decrement significantly if we decide to pay for the veloce acquisition using a greater proportion of cash or if our 
table of contents normal operations require us to expend more cash 
if our cash balances decline significantly  we may be faced with liquidity issues and may be forced to raise capital from other sources  which may or may not be possible to do so on reasonable terms 
interruptions  delays  security breaches or other unauthorized activities at third party data centers or other cloud computing infrastructure providers could materially harm our business 
we conduct significant business functions and computer operations  including without limitation data storage and email  using the infrastructure systems of third party vendors  such as remote data centers  virtual servers and other cloud computing resources 
cloud computing is an information technology hosting and delivery system in which data is stored outside of the user s physical infrastructure and is delivered to and used by the user as an internet based application service 
these third party systems may experience cyber attacks and other security breaches  along with the possible risk of loss  theft or unauthorized publication of our technical  proprietary and trade secret information or other confidential information of our employees and customers 
any interruptions or problems at such data centers or other cloud computing facilities could result in significant disruptions to our business operations hosted at or affected by such site 
we do not control the operation of such data center or other providers  and each is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  vandalism  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
these third party vendor relationships present further risk management challenges for us  including  among others confirming and monitoring the third party s security measures  the potential for improper handling of or access to our data  and data location uncertainty  including the possibility of data storage in inappropriate jurisdictions  where laws or security measures may be inadequate  or the unauthorized movement of technical data between locations in violation of applicable export laws 
we undertake substantial efforts to assure the security and confidentiality of information provided to our vendors under cloud computing or other arrangements through appropriate risk evaluation  security and financial due diligence  contracts designed to set and maintain high security and confidentiality standards  and ongoing evaluation of third party compliance with the required standards 
while we expend significant resources on these measures  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing attacks  breaches or other unauthorized activities or detecting and stopping them once they have begun 
our failure to effectively manage and communicate our strategies with our outsourced service providers  or their failure to perform as required or to properly protect our data  may result in operational difficulties which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  such data center and other providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to renew our agreements with the data center and other providers on commercially reasonable terms  we may experience costs or down time in connection with the transfer to new third party providers 
we are dependent on orders that are received and shipped in the same quarter and are therefore limited in our visibility of future product shipments 
our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter  which we refer to as turns business 
we measure turns business at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the shipment forecasts that we set entering the quarter 
historically  we have relied on our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy  resulting in customers placing orders with relatively short delivery schedules 
shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduce our backlog visibility on future product shipments 
turns business correlate to overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times 
because turns business is difficult to predict  varying levels of turns business make our net sales more difficult to forecast 
if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns business in a particular quarter relative to our revenue forecasts  our revenue and operation results may suffer 

table of contents our business is dependent on selling to distributors 
sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our revenues during the fiscal year ended march  and during the fiscal year ended march  our largest distributor accounted for approximately of our revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and during the fiscal year ended march  we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and either party can terminate the relationship with little advance notice any future adverse conditions in the us and global economies or in the us and global credit markets could materially impact the operations of our distributors 
any deterioration in the financial condition of our distributors or any disruption in the operations of our distributors could adversely impact the flow of our products to our end customers and adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  during an industry or economic downturn  it is possible there will be an oversupply of products and a decrease in sell through of our products by our distributors which could cause them to hold excess inventories and reduce our net sales in a given period and result in an increase in stock rotations 
our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
the technology equipment industry is cyclical and has in the past experienced significant and extended downturns 
the recent downturn was significant and we cannot predict if the current improvement is sustainable in the near future 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
we sell our communications ic products primarily to communications equipment manufacturers that in turn sell their equipment to customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
the past downturn has caused a reduction in capital spending on information technology 
while we are beginning to see indications of improvement  there are no guarantees that this growth will sustain  resulting in potential volatility 
if there is another downturn  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of one or more key customers  the diminished demand for our products from a key customer  or the failure to obtain certifications from a key customer or its distribution channel could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from our key customers 
one or more of our key customers may discontinue operations as a result of consolidation  bankruptcy or otherwise 
reductions  delays and cancellation of orders from our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our ability to maintain or increase sales to key customers and attract significant new customers is subject to a variety of factors  including supply constraints and manufacturing delays by our outside foundries may result in significantly reduced volumes and delayed deliveries of our products  customers may stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and may suffer little or no penalty as a result of such action  customers or prospective customers may not incorporate our products into their future product designs  design wins as explained below with customers or prospective customers may not result in sales to such customers  the introduction of new products by customers may occur later or be less successful in the market than planned  
table of contents we may successfully design a product to customer specifications but the customer may not be successful in the market  sales of customer product lines incorporating our products may rapidly decline or such product lines may be phased out  our agreements with customers typically are non exclusive and do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may cause our customers to switch from using our products to using competing products  some of our oem customers may develop products internally that would replace our products  we may not be able to successfully develop relationships with additional network equipment vendors  our relationships with some of our larger customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products  the impact of terminating certain sales representatives or sales personnel as a result of a company workforce reduction or otherwise  and some of our customers and prospective customers may become less viable or fail 
the occurrence of any one of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no guarantee that design wins will become actual orders and sales 
a design win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be integrated with the customer s product 
there can be delays of several months or more between the design win and when a customer initiates actual orders of our product 
following a design win  we will commit significant resources to the integration of our product into the customer s product before receiving the initial order 
receipt of an initial order from a customer following a design win  however  is dependent on a number of factors  including the success of the customer s product  and cannot be guaranteed 
the design win may never result in an actual order or sale of our products 
any significant order cancellations or order deferrals could cause unplanned inventory growth resulting in excess inventory  which may adversely affect our operating results 
our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages or cancel orders if their inventories are too high 
major inventory corrections by our customers are not uncommon and can last for significant periods of time and affect demand for our products 
customers may also cancel or delay orders in anticipation of new products or for other reasons 
cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins by reducing sales prices  incurring inventory write downs or writing off additional obsolete products 
the book to bill ratio is commonly used by investors to compare and evaluate technology and semiconductor companies 
the book to bill ratio is a demand to supply ratio that compares the total amount of orders received to the total amount of orders filled 
this ratio tells whether the company has more orders than it delivered if greater than  has the same amount of orders that it delivered equals  or has less orders than it delivered under 
though the ratio provides an indicator of whether orders are rising or falling  it does not consider the timing of  or if the order will result in future revenues and the effect of changing lead times on bookings 
as lead times increase  customers will place orders sooner  therefore increasing our bookings and book to bill ratio 

table of contents the increasing lead times from our suppliers cause us to make commitments for inventory purchases earlier in our production cycle which in turn increases our risk of having excess inventory 
in addition  some of our suppliers are delivering based on allocations which in turn cause us to increase our inventory levels 
we must balance our inventory levels between the risk of losing a significant customer to a competitor because we cannot meet our customer s requirements and the risk of having excess inventory if a significant order is cancelled 
inventory fluctuations could affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times  meet customer expectations and guard against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not pay for these products  we could miss future revenue projections or incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our customers products typically have lengthy design cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional nine months or more to begin volume production of the equipment or devices that incorporate our product 
due to this generally lengthy design cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we cannot guarantee that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or devices that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in this lengthy design cycle increases the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
while our customers design cycles are typically long  some of our product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to r d  product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant r d and marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to mitigate those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 
an important part of our strategy is to focus on the markets for communications equipment 
if we change strategy or are unable to further expand our share of these markets or react timely or properly to emerging trends  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
our markets frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if our products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  or if our products fail to be certified by oems  we will lose business from an existing or potential customer and may not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins or certification until the next product transition occurs 
if we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards  or if we experience a delay as short as a few months in certifying or bringing a new product to market  or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period 
we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to be derived from sales of products based on current  widely accepted transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or gain substantial market acceptance 

table of contents if we do not identify and pursue the correct emerging trends and align ourselves with the correct market leaders  we may not be successful and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
customers for our products generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have traditionally used these resources to internally develop their own products 
the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products 
future sales prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third party sourcing for products as an alternative to in house development 
network equipment vendors may in the future continue to use internally developed components 
they also may decide to develop or acquire components  technologies or products that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
if our network equipment vendor customers fail to accept our products as an alternative  if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products  or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our business strategy contemplates the acquisition of other companies  products and technologies 
merger and acquisition activities involve numerous risks and we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems that could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties  making equity investments in companies developing such products  technologies or businesses  and making additional investments in companies in which we already have an interest are all part of our long term business strategy 
the risks involved with merger and acquisition and equity investment activities include diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  failure to integrate or potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired companies  difficulty in completing an acquired company s in process research or development projects  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company s products or services  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  costs associated with acquisitions  mergers or investments  difficulties associated with combining or integrating acquired companies  purchased operations  products or technologies  difficulties and risks associated with entering and competing in markets that are unfamiliar to us  and ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections 
in addition  in the event of any such investments  mergers or acquisitions  we could  issue stock that would dilute  in some cases significantly  our current stockholders percentage ownership  use a significant portion of our cash reserves or incur debt  assume liabilities  including unknown liabilities or other unanticipated costs  events or circumstances  incur amortization or impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and deferred compensation  and incur large and immediate write offs 

table of contents any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as with past acquisitions  future acquisitions could adversely affect operating results 
in particular  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  unanticipated third party litigation  adverse tax consequences  substantial additional depreciation or deferred compensation charges 
our past purchase acquisitions required us to capitalize significant amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
as a result of the slowdown in our industry and reduction of our market capitalization  we have been required to record significant impairment charges against these assets as noted in our previous financial statements 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long these current uncertain economic conditions may last 
these conditions have caused a decline in our near term revenues and it will take some time to ramp back up to our previous levels  if at all 
additionally  market values had deteriorated  which had an unfavorable impact on our valuations which are part of the goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment tests 
there can be no assurances that market conditions will not deteriorate further or that our market capitalization will not decline further 
at march   we had million of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take significant charges as a result of impairment to the carrying value of the purchased intangible assets  due to further adverse changes in market conditions 
in september  we completed the acquisition of tpack for million in cash  exclusive of million cash acquired  and potentially up to an additional million if certain performance milestones are achieved during an month period following the closing of the acquisition 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we recorded million in amortizable intangible assets and million in goodwill 
please see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in january  tpack s primary supplier of fpgas announced it had acquired a competitor of tpack 
this supplier will continue to provide fpgas for tpack s current products and products currently under development  but not for any future products 
while we were negotiating with another supplier of fpgas  they too acquired a competitor of tpack in march the increased competition from these synergistic acquisitions could adversely affect the future revenue streams from tpack as we implement a library strategy where customers can choose either fpga supplier 
the financial forecasts and other assumptions used to evaluate the acquisition that is included as part of the overall reporting unit may not materialize as expected 
in april  the company amended its original merger agreement with veloce and proposes to acquire veloce for an initial consideration of million with potential additional consideration that could range from to million  as adjusted based upon actual technical performance results 
the acquisition is expected to close in june our industry and markets are subject to consolidation  which may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand 
there has been industry consolidation among communications ic companies  network equipment companies and telecommunications companies in the past  such as the acquisition of seamicro inc by advanced micro devices in february  netlogic microsystems  inc by broadcom corporation in february and gennum corporation by semtech corporation in march we expect this consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets 
consolidation may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations because we rely heavily on international sales 
international sales account for a significant part of our revenues and may account for an increasing portion of our future revenues 
the revenues we derive from international sales may be subject to certain risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  
table of contents changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  rising protectionism and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  natural disasters  increased exposure to liability under u 
s and foreign anti corruption laws and regulations  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in managing distributors  difficulties in obtaining governmental and export approvals for communications  processors and other products  reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable in some countries  burdens of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences  and an uncertain economic condition that may trail any improvements in the united states 
we are subject to risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products  information and technology 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from laws in the united states  or may require that dispute resolution occur in a foreign country 
as a result  our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements may be limited compared with our ability to enforce our rights under agreements governed by laws in the united states and adjudicated in the united states 
our foreign operations may subject us to risks relating to the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar foreign anti bribery regulations that may have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations are also subject to laws regarding the conduct of business overseas  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  and similar anti bribery regulations in foreign jurisdictions where we do business  such as china  india  vietnam and in europe 
the fcpa prohibits the provision of illegal or improper inducements to foreign government officials in connection with obtaining or retaining business overseas or to secure an improper commercial advantage 
the fcpa also requires us to keep accurate books and records of business transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls 
violations of the fcpa or other similar laws by us  any of our foreign subsidiaries  or any of our or their employees  executive officers  distributors or other agents or intermediaries could subject us and the individuals involved to significant criminal or civil liability 
in recent years  the department of justice and sec have significantly stepped up their 
table of contents investigation and prosecution of alleged fcpa violations 
any such allegations of non compliance with the fcpa or other similar laws could harm our reputation  divert management attention and result in significant expenses  and could therefore materially harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our portfolio of short term investments is exposed to certain market risks 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
our investment portfolio is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of the issuers  as well as to the risks of default by the issuers and lack of overall market liquidity 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit rating risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced 
increases in interest rates or decreases in the credit worthiness of one or more of the issuers in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded million in write downs in the carrying value of certain securities as we determined the decline in the fair value of these securities to be other than temporary 
if there is a further deterioration in market conditions or there are additional losses incurred  we may be required to record a further decline in the carrying value of these securities resulting in further charges 
at march   the unrealized losses on these securities that were not written down as an other than temporary impairment charge were approximately million  of which substantially the entire amount has been at an unrealized loss for greater than months 
if the fair value of any of these securities does not recover to at least the amortized cost of such security or we are unable to hold these securities until they recover  we may be required to record a decline in the carrying value of these securities 
our restructuring activities could result in management distractions  operational disruptions and other difficulties 
over the past several years  we have initiated several restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating costs and such restructuring activities are likely to continue 
employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with our competitors  customers or suppliers 
although each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire  which agreement contains covenants prohibiting among other things the disclosure or use of our confidential information and the solicitation of our employees  we cannot guarantee that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment  or that our key continuing employees will not be solicited to terminate their employment with us 
any additional restructuring efforts could divert the attention of our management away from our operations  harm our reputation  increase our expenses  increase the work load placed upon remaining employees and cause our remaining employees to lose confidence in the future performance of the company and decide to leave 
we cannot guarantee that any additional restructuring activities undertaken in the future will be successful  or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or future restructuring plans 
in addition  if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to new growth opportunities 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent introductions of new products and enhancements  
table of contents increased integration with other functions  long design and sales cycles  short product life cycles  and intense competition 
to develop new products for the communications or other technology markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to develop technical and design expertise 
we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet customers changing needs 
we must respond to changing industry standards  trends towards increased integration and other technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
our pursuit of technological advances may require substantial time and expense and may ultimately prove unsuccessful 
if we are not successful in adopting such advances  we may be unable to timely bring to market new products and our revenues will suffer 
many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in these markets in the future 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect that domestic and international competition will increase in these markets  due in part to deregulation  rapid technological advances  price erosion  changing customer preferences and evolving industry standards 
increased competition could result in significant price competition  reduced revenues  lower profit margins or loss of market share 
our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors  including our ability to partner with oem and channel partners who are successful in the market  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality  interoperability  reliability  performance and certification  our ability to attract and retain key engineering  operations  sales and marketing employees and management  customer support  time to market  price  production efficiency  design wins  expansion of production of our products for particular systems manufacturers  end user acceptance of the systems manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products  and general economic conditions 

table of contents our competitors may offer enhancements to existing products  or offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements that are available to customers on a more timely basis than comparable products from us or that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our products 
the introduction of enhancements or new products by our competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
we expect that certain of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may seek to develop and introduce products that integrate the functions performed by our ic products on a single chip  thus eliminating the need for our products 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the transport communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as broadcom  cortina  pmc sierra and vitesse 
in the embedded processor communications ic market  we compete with technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  cavium and intel 
many of these companies may have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
certain of our customers or potential customers have internal ic design or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
we may also face competition from new entrants to our target markets  including larger technology companies that may develop or acquire differentiating technology and then apply their resources to our detriment 
any failure by us to compete successfully in these target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results depend on manufacturing output and yields of our ics and printed circuit board assemblies  which may not meet expectations 
the yields on wafers we have manufactured decline whenever a substantial percentage of wafers must be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer are nonfunctional 
such declines can be caused by many factors  including minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  design issues  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer and difficulties in the fabrication process 
design iterations and process changes by our suppliers can cause a risk of defects 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  are time consuming and expensive to remedy and can result in shipment delays 
we estimate yields per wafer and final packaged parts in order to estimate the value of inventory 
if yields are materially different than projected  work in process inventory may need to be re valued 
we may have to take inventory write downs as a result of decreases in manufacturing yields 
we may suffer periodic yield problems in connection with new or existing products or in connection with the commencement of production using a new design geometry or at a new manufacturing facility 
we must develop or otherwise gain access to improved ic process technologies 
our future success will depend upon our ability to access new ic process technologies 
in the future  we will be required to transition one or more of our ic products to process technologies with smaller geometries  other materials or higher speeds in order to reduce costs or improve product performance 
we may not be able to gain access to new process technologies in a timely or affordable manner or products based on these new technologies may not achieve market acceptance 
the complexity of our products may lead to errors  defects and bugs  which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability 
products as complex as ours may contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have in the past experienced such errors  defects and bugs 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
errors  defects or bugs could cause problems with device functionality  resulting in interruptions  delays or cessation of sales to our customers 

table of contents we may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems 
we cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production  despite testing by us  our suppliers or our customers 
any such problems could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  and loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
regulatory authorities in jurisdictions into which we ship out products could levy fines or restrict our ability to export products 
a significant portion of our sales are made outside of the us through the exporting and re exporting of products 
in addition to local jurisdictions export regulations  our us manufactured products and products based on us technology are subject to us laws and regulations governing international trade and exports 
these laws and regulations include  but not limited to  the foreign corrupt practices act  the export administration regulations ear  and trade sanctions against embargoed countries and destinations administered by the us department of the treasury  office of foreign assets control ofac 
licenses or proper license exceptions are required for the shipment of our products to certain countries as well as for the transfer of certain information and technology to certain foreign countries  foreign nationals or other prohibited persons within the united states or abroad 
a determination by the us or local government that we have failed to comply with these or other export or anti bribery regulations can result in penalties which may include denial of export privileges  fines  civil and criminal penalties and seizure of products 
such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to meet our sales and earnings forecasts 
further  a change in these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to export to previously permitted countries  customers  distributors or other third parties 
any one or more of these sanctions or a change in laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential us tax legislation regarding our foreign earnings could materially and adversely impact our business and financial results 
currently  a majority of our revenue is generated from customers located outside the us and a substantial portion of our employees are located outside the us present us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings for our non us subsidiaries  because such earning are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of those subsidiaries 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k for that fiscal year 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s 
table of contents objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of control must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of internal control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been  or will be  detected 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  our internal control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
our management has concluded  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report our internal control over financial reporting as ineffective 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  we may experience a restatement like we have in the past of our financial statements and or a loss of public confidence  either of which could have an adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key senior management  design engineering  sales  marketing  and manufacturing personnel  our ability to identify  hire and retain additional  qualified personnel and successful succession planning 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management and engineering personnel and successful succession planning 
the loss of key senior executives or engineers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design  product and test engineers 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business  or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future 
we also face the risks associated with our former employees assisting their new employers to recruit our key talent  in violation of their contractual non solicitation and confidentiality covenants to us 
for example  in december we commenced a lawsuit in the california superior court in santa clara county against two former appliedmicro employees one of whom was a former company officer and their new employer for causes of action including  among other things  breach of the employees contractual non solicitation covenants to us in connection with their efforts to recruit key appliedmicro engineers to join their new company 
in august  following the results of our discovery in that action  we amended our complaint to add an additional defendant and additional causes of action  including breach of fiduciary duty and new breach of contract and contract interference claims 
in such action  which is not yet scheduled for trial  we are seeking damages  including exemplary and punitive damages  injunctive relief and costs of suit 
in addition  while we encourage our employees to abide by all contractual and legal obligations owed to their former employers  there can be no assurance that we will not be the target of allegations made by other companies that we have  directly or indirectly  unlawfully solicited their employees to join us 
there are significant costs associated with recruiting  hiring and retaining personnel  as well as significant actual and potential losses to our business arising from the delays in or cancellation of technology development  product completion and roll out  customer design wins and product orders  and sales revenues caused by the departure of key engineering resources 
to manage our operations effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems and to successfully hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
also  the integration of future business acquisitions would require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to manage our expanded operations effectively 

table of contents periods of contraction in our business may also inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel 
as we respond to declining revenues and or implement additional cost improvement measures such as reductions in force  our remaining key employees may lose confidence in the future performance of the company and decide to leave 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business 
our ability to supply a sufficient number of products to meet demand could be severely hampered by a shortage of water  electricity or other supplies or by natural disasters or other catastrophes or by the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats 
the manufacture of our products requires significant amounts of water 
previous droughts have resulted in restrictions being placed on water use by manufacturers 
in the event of a future drought  reductions in water use may be mandated generally and our external foundries ability to manufacture our products could be impaired 
several of our facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located in california 
california has experienced prolonged energy alerts and blackouts caused by disruption in energy supplies 
as a consequence  businesses and other energy consumers in california continue to experience substantially increased costs of electricity and natural gas 
we are unsure whether energy alerts and blackouts will reoccur or how severe they may become in the future 
many of our customers and suppliers are also headquartered or have substantial operations in california 
if we or any of our major customers or suppliers located in california experience a sustained disruption in energy supplies  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in asia 
these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods  like japan and thailand 
we do not have earthquake insurance for these facilities  because adequate coverage is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
a significant natural disaster or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  including  but not limited to  the outbreak of epidemic disease  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to local and global economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with more than other companies that used omega chemical corporation waste treatment facility in whittier  california the omega site 
the us environmental protection agency epa has alleged that the omega site failed to properly treat and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain on going remediation efforts at the omega site and with respect to the regional groundwater allegedly contaminated thereby 

table of contents in  the prps were sued by a chemical company located downstream from the omega site  seeking a judicial determination that the omega prps are responsible for some or all of the plaintiff s potential liability to clean up groundwater contamination beneath plaintiff s site  that action has been stayed since march to allow for further delineation of the regional groundwater 
in september  epa issued an interim remedial action proposal  designed to arrest the further spread of groundwater contamination  in the next few months epa is expected to notify the prps with requests to implement the interim remedial action 
in  a toxic tort litigation was commenced against omega and the prp group by individuals alleging injuries caused by the omega site  trial in such action has been scheduled for november based on currently available information  we have a loss accrual for the omega site that is not material and we believe that the actual amount of costs and liabilities will not be materially different from the amount accrued 
however  proceedings are ongoing and the eventual outcome of the clean up efforts and the pending litigation matters is uncertain at this time 
based on currently available information  we do not believe that any eventual outcome will have a material adverse effect on our operations but we cannot guarantee this result 
in  the us supreme court decided us v 
burlington northern santa fe railway co  s 
ct 
 which determined that hazardous substance cleanup liability need not be joint and several in all cases 
as a result of this decision  the liability is potentially divisible among the prps at an earlier stage in superfund cases such as omega 
at this time we do not know and cannot predict the full impact of this decision on our liability 
in november  a significant member of the prp group withdrew from the group 
in january  as a result of the prp group s modification of its allocation formulae and group member withdrawal  our proportional allocation of responsibility among the prps for the current remediation space increased 
any future increases to our proportional allocation of responsibility among the prps or the future reduction of parties participating in the prp group due to additional member withdrawals could materially increase our potential liability relating to the omega site 
although we believe that we have been and currently are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in material compliance with these laws or regulations or that our future obligations to fund any remediation efforts  including those at the omega site  or expenses and potential liabilities relating to the pending litigation matters  will not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
customers demands and new regulations related to conflict free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act may require disclosure of use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries and efforts to prevent the use of such minerals 
in the semiconductor industry  these minerals are most commonly found in metals 
as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free metals  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  since our supply chain is complex and some suppliers will not share their confidential supplier information  we may face challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to sufficiently verify that the metals used in our products are conflict free 
some customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier and we may have to write off inventory in the event that it becomes unsalable as a result of these regulations 
environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 
we are subject to various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain products 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate  including various european union eu member countries 
for example  the eu has enacted the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs and the waste electrical and 
table of contents electronic equipment weee directives 
rohs prohibits the use of lead and other substances in semiconductors and other products put on the market after july  the weee directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment on the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment  register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment  and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment 
there can be no assurance that similar programs will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs  possible delays in delivering products  and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
we rely in part on patents to protect our ip 
we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will adequately protect the ip in our products and processes  will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that if challenged  any such patents will be found to be valid or enforceable 
others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents we currently hold or that may be issued to us 
to protect our ip  we also rely on the combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and licensing arrangements 
despite these efforts  we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent ip or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or ip  or disclose such ip or trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our ip 
a failure by us to meaningfully protect our ip could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  suppliers  customers and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we could be harmed by litigation involving patents  proprietary rights or other claims 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our ip rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other ip rights 
currently the company is not a named defendant in any ip infringement lawsuits 
nevertheless  as our products and ip become instantiated in more and more customer products and applications  and as patent infringement litigation brought by our competitors  non practicing entities also known as patent trolls and patent licensing companies is on the rise  we are at an increased risk of being named as a defendant in such litigation 
due in part to the factors described above  the company has been or currently is subject to the following having information about our products and technologies subpoenaed in patent litigation between other third parties  demands that we enter into expensive licenses of third party patent portfolios in order to avoid being named as a defendant in future ip infringement suits  and 
table of contents claims demanding that we indemnify customers or end users of our products with respect to their potential liability  including without limitation defense costs  arising from third party ip infringement claims brought against them 
such claims  demands and litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of our management and technical personnel  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be accused of infringing on or misappropriating the ip rights of third parties 
in addition  we have contractual indemnification obligations to some of our customers  and other customers or end users may assert we have duties to indemnify them  with respect to claims that our products infringe third party ip rights 
for example  in connection with the patent infringement lawsuit previously brought by broadcom corporation against emulex corporation in the united states district court in the central district of california  emulex has demanded that several of its components suppliers  including appliedmicro  indemnify emulex from and against certain legal expenses and other potential liabilities arising from the lawsuit 
although we are a supplier of components used by emulex in certain products accused in the broadcom litigation  we do not currently believe we have any obligations under the terms of our existing supply agreement with emulex to indemnify it with respect to the broadcom litigation 
notwithstanding the foregoing  there can be no assurance that ip infringement or misappropriation claims by third parties  or additional claims for indemnification by customers or end users resulting from infringement claims against them  will not be asserted in the future  or that any such existing or future assertions will not harm our business 
any litigation relating to the ip rights of third parties would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the ip rights of the third party claiming infringement 
a license might not be available on reasonable  economic and other terms or at all 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to other claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
the ultimate outcome of any such litigation matters could have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
in the future  the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to general economic and market conditions and in response to quarter to quarter variations in our anticipated or actual operating results  announcements or introductions of new products by us or our competitors  anticipated or actual operating results of our customers  peers or competitors  technological innovations or setbacks by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor  communications or information technology markets  the commencement or outcome of litigation or governmental investigations  changes in ratings and estimates of our performance by securities analysts  announcements of merger or acquisition transactions  management changes  our inclusion in certain stock indices  and other events or factors 

table of contents the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many high technology companies  particularly semiconductor companies 
in some instances  these fluctuations appear to have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the affected companies 
whether or not our stock is part of one or more index funds could have a significant impact on our stock 
we cannot assure you that our stock will be part of any index fund 
in addition  the current decline of the financial markets and related factors beyond our control  including the credit and mortgage crisis in both the us and worldwide  may cause our stock price to decline rapidly and unexpectedly 
delaware law and our corporate charter and bylaws contain anti takeover provisions that could delay or discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  as amended  and our bylaws  as amended and restated  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our directors and management 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board of directors to issue up to million shares of blank check preferred stock with terms designed to prevent or delay a takeover attempt  as described further below  the prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates  the requirement for advance notice for nominations of directors for election to the board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders meeting  the ability of the board of directors to alter our bylaws without obtaining stockholder approval  the requirement that any stockholder derivative actions and certain other intra corporate disputes be litigated solely and exclusively in delaware state court the right of the board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors and the prohibition of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions may prohibit  restrict or significantly delay large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of our outstanding voting stock  from merging or combining with us 
although we believe these provisions in our charter and bylaws and under delaware law collectively provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in any event  these provisions may delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us 
any such delay or prevention could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents if we issue additional shares of stock in the future  it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have a significant number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available 
these shares will provide us with the flexibility to issue our common stock for proper corporate purposes  which may include making acquisitions including without limitation  our proposed acquisition of veloce through the use of stock  adopting additional equity incentive plans and raising equity capital 
any issuance of our common stock may result in immediate dilution of our stockholders

our corporate headquarters are located in sunnyvale  california 
sales and engineering offices are located throughout the world 
we are a semiconductor company that possesses fundamental and differentiated intellectual property for high speed signal processing  packet based communications processors and telecommunications transport protocols 
this intellectual property enables us to be a key player in the data center  enterprise and telecommunications applications 
our customer focus is on the oems and telecommunications companies that build and connect to data centers 
as of march   our business had two reporting units  computing and connectivity formerly referred to as process and transport  respectively 
since the start of fiscal  we have invested a total of million in the r d of new products  including higher speed  lower power and lower cost products  products that combine the functions of multiple existing products into single highly integrated solutions  and other products to expand and complete our portfolio of communications solutions 
these products  and our customers products for which they are intended  are highly complex 
due to this complexity  it often takes several years to complete the development and qualification of a product before it enters into volume production 
accordingly  we have not yet generated significant revenues from some of the products developed during this time period 
in addition  downturns in the telecommunications market can severely impact our customers business and often result in significantly less demand for our products than was expected when the development work commenced 
acquisition of veloce the company proposes to acquire veloce in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and plan of merger  entered into as of may   by and among the company  veloce  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company merger sub  and the stockholders representative named therein the initial agreement 
the initial agreement was amended by amendment no 
entered into on november  the first amendment and amendment no 
entered into on april  the second amendment and  together with the initial agreement and the first amendment  the merger agreement 
the second amendment  which added a second wholly owned subsidiary of the company merger sub ii as a party  amended  restated and replaced the first amendment in its entirety 
pursuant to the merger agreement  upon achievement of a specified fpga product development milestone by veloce the fpga ii milestone  and the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions  a two step merger will occur  in each case in accordance with the merger certificate filing and other statutory requirements of the delaware general corporation law 
first  merger sub will merge with and into veloce  with veloce as the surviving entity 
second  directly thereafter veloce will merge with and into merger sub ii  with merger sub ii surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of the company the surviving entity 
in and as a result of the merger  and without any further action by any party to the merger agreement or any security holder of veloce  each authorized share of veloce capital stock or its equivalent will be converted at the effective time of the merger into and represent the right to receive a portion of the total consideration payable by the company in the merger the merger consideration  subject to the satisfaction of any remaining vesting requirements  if applicable 
the merger consideration will consist of the following aggregate amounts million payable upon the closing of the merger the closing  and additional amounts ranging from to million  as adjusted based upon actual technical performance results  in the event that certain post closing performance based product development milestones relating to the products on which veloce has worked are achieved by the surviving entity and the company 
the additional consideration would be payable in partial amounts calculated pursuant to the merger agreement upon the achievement of each such milestone 

table of contents the merger consideration is payable  at the company s election  in cash  shares of the company s common stock  or a combination of the two 
pursuant to the merger agreement  each share of company common stock issued as merger consideration will be valued  with respect to any given payment  based upon the average closing price of the company s common stock as quoted on the nasdaq global select market for the ten trading days immediately preceding the date such payment is paid or becomes payable 
the company currently intends to treat the merger as a reorganization under section of the internal revenue code a reorganization in the tax returns of the company  veloce and the surviving entity 
one of the requirements of a reorganization is that the continuity of interest test be satisfied  which requires that shares of company common stock form a substantial part of the consideration received by veloce s shareholders in exchange for their veloce stock 
one of the intended purposes of the two step merger procedure described above is to reduce the total amount of company common stock required to be issued to satisfy the continuity of interest test 
the company currently intends to issue sufficient shares of its common stock to cause the continuity of interest test to be satisfied 
under the nasdaq rules  the company would be required to obtain company shareholder approval if the merger transaction involved the issuance or potential issuance of shares of company common stock equal to or more of the company s common stock outstanding before the issuance 
the company does not currently anticipate that the amount of company common stock to be issued as merger consideration will trigger the company shareholder approval requirement described above 
the company has filed an application for the purpose of qualifying the sale of the company s common stock to be issued in the merger in accordance with the california corporations code the ccc  and for the purpose of requesting and conducting a hearing the fairness hearing pursuant to the ccc  in order to exempt such common stock from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  by virtue of the exemption provided by section a thereof 
under applicable corporate law  upon the closing  all of the property  rights  privileges  powers and franchises of veloce will vest in the surviving entity and all debts  liabilities and duties of veloce will become the debts  liabilities and duties of the surviving entity 
it is currently anticipated that the closing will occur in june  subject to the achievement of the fpga ii milestone by veloce and the satisfaction of all closing conditions  including the completion of the fairness hearing 
in the event of a june closing  the company anticipates that approximately million to million of the million initial merger consideration will be paid out at the closing and the remaining portion of the million will be payable over the next three years upon completion of the remaining vesting requirements of the veloce shares or share equivalents 
for accounting purposes  all merger consideration  regardless of form  will be recognized as r d expense 
the merger agreement contains customary representations  warranties and covenants and may be terminated upon mutual agreement of the parties or unilaterally by the company or veloce if the other party fails to meet certain conditions and comply with certain obligations set forth in the agreement 
under the second amendment  the company and veloce agreed to have the company  subject to the terms and conditions of the merger agreement  offset claims for future potential indemnifiable losses  if any  against the amount of any unpaid merger consideration as of the time such claim is made 
the company s right to offset claims for future potential indemnifiable losses against unpaid merger consideration is in lieu of any requirement that a portion of the merger consideration be deposited in an escrow account to secure any future claims by the company for such losses 
in connection with the second amendment  the company and veloce also modified the warrant to purchase shares of the company s common stock  previously granted to veloce in may and amended in november  by accelerating the vesting schedule so as to be fully vested on april  
table of contents on may   the company and veloce also entered into a product development agreement as amended on november  and july   the development agreement pursuant to which veloce performs product development work relating to an arm v processor for the company on an exclusive basis for cash and other consideration  including a warrant to purchase company common stock 
veloce s product development work for the company comprises substantially all of veloce s business and operations 
the company does not hold any equity interest in veloce 
in march  we entered into a master technology license agreement tla with arm  a leading semiconductor ip supplier  enabling us thereafter to license specific arm technology

table of contents net revenues 
we generate revenues primarily through sales of our ic products  embedded processors and printed circuit board assemblies to oems  such as alcatel lucent  ciena  cisco  brocade  fujitsu  hitachi  huawei  juniper  ericsson  nec  nortel  nokia siemens networks  and tellabs  who in turn supply their equipment principally to communications service providers 
in november  we entered into a patent purchase agreement ppa with acacia patent acquisition llc whereby we agreed to sell a series of our patents  patent applications and associated rights related to certain technologies for an aggregate purchase price of million payable over two years and a share of royalty payments for assignment of rights under the sale and or use of the patents 
due to the nature of the payment terms  related revenue is being recorded as the payments are received 
in july  we also entered into a ppa with qualcomm incorporated whereby we agreed to sell a series of our patents  patent applications and associated rights related to certain technologies for an aggregate purchase price of million payable over three years in equal quarterly payments of million each beginning in the three months ended december  through march  due to the nature of the payment terms  related revenue was recorded as the payments were received 
on a sell through basis  we had approximately days of inventory in the distributor channel at march  as compared to days at march  the increase in inventory days during fiscal related in part due to the effect of increased revenues from end of life product sales that are usually sold on a non cancellable  non returnable basis and may take several quarters for the product to be sold through and decremented from the channel 
the gross margins for our solutions have historically declined over time 
some factors that we expect to cause downward pressure on the gross margins for our products include competitive pricing pressures  unfavorable product mix  the cost sensitivity of our customers particularly in the higher volume markets  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and capacity constraints in our supply chain 
from time to time  for strategic reasons  we may accept orders at less than optimal gross margins in order to facilitate the introduction of  or  market penetration of our new or existing products 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to offset any reduction in gross margins of our products by reducing costs  increasing sales volume  developing and introducing new products and developing new generations and versions of existing products on a timely basis 
we classify our revenues into two categories based on the markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are computing and connectivity 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets 
we are continuing to focus our current connectivity investments on high growth g and faster ethernet solutions  data center  optical transport network otn and enterprise market opportunities while continuing to service the telecom sonet sdh market 
over time  we believe customers will transition from the sonet sdh standard to higher speed  lower power products that utilize the otn standard in order to support the increasing demand for transmission of data over networks 
however  the timing and extent of this transition is uncertain due to the significant investment that is needed to convert networks to the otn standard 
as such  the rate of conversion to the otn standard is  in part  greatly influenced by global economic market conditions 
recessionary type market conditions will result in a slower transition of networks to the otn standard 
additionally  there can be no assurance that our revenues will increase as the otn standard is adopted 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory corrections  
table of contents the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on the sales  pricing and gross margins of our products 
our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and communications markets  combinations of companies in our customer base  resulting in the combined company choosing our competitor s ic standardization rather than our supported product platforms  the gain or loss of one or more key customers  or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our expectation of a market ramp for our products could be incorrect and such ramp could get pushed out or not happen at all  our ability to meet customer demand due to capacity constraints at our suppliers  and natural disasters that could affect our supply chain or our customer s supply chain which would affect their requirements of our products 
for these and other reasons  our net revenue and results of operations for the three fiscal years ended march  may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
based on direct shipments  net revenues to customers that was equal to or greater than of total net revenues in any of the three years ended march  were as follows avnet distributor wintec global logistics provider flextronics sub contract manufacturer hon hai sub contract manufacturer less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
net revenues by geographic region were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended march  united states of america taiwan hong kong china europe japan malaysia singapore other asia other the change is primarily due to a major end customer changing its logistics management program 

table of contents all of our revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars  other than revenues that account for less than of our total revenues  which are denominated primarily in danish kroner 
key non gaap measurements 
we use certain non gaap metrics such as adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda to measure our performance 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss  less interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  amortization of intangibles and other one time and or non cash items 
the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda to the accompanying financial statements in thousands fiscal years ended march  net loss adjustment to net loss interest and other income  net stock based compensation expense amortization of purchased intangibles restructuring charges veloce accrued liability impairment of marketable securities depreciation gain impairment on strategic investments  net acquisition related adjustment other and income tax adjustment gain from discontinued operations adjusted ebitda for non gaap purposes  any gain or loss relating to marketable securities is not recognized until the underlying securities are sold and the actual gain or loss is realized 
we believe that adjusted ebitda is a useful supplemental measure of our operation s performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the accounting impact of the company s financing strategies  tax provisions  depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  stock based compensation expense  discontinued operations and certain other operating items 
we adjust for these excluded items because we believe that  in general  these items possess one or more of the following characteristics their magnitude and timing is largely outside of the company s control  they are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business in the ordinary course  they are unusual or infrequent and the company does not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business  or they are non cash expenses 
adjusted ebitda is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for operating income  net income or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda is used by our management as a measure of operating efficiency and overall financial performance for benchmarking against our peers and competitors and is used as a metric to determine the performance vesting of our three year restricted stock unit grants issued in may the ebitda grants and may the ebitda grants 
management believes adjusted ebitda provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the underlying operating performance of our business 
management also believes that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate the company 
the book to bill ratio is another metric commonly used by investors to compare and evaluate technology and semiconductor companies 
the book to bill ratio is a demand to supply ratio that compares the total amount 
table of contents of orders received to the total amount of orders filled 
this ratio tells whether the company has more orders than it delivered if greater than  has the same amount of orders that it delivered equals  or has less orders than it delivered under 
though the ratio provides an indicator of whether orders are rising or falling  it does not consider the timing of or if the order will result in future revenues 
our book to bill ratio at march   and was  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to inventory valuation and capitalized mask set costs  which affect our cost of sales and gross profit  the valuation of goodwill and purchased intangibles  which has in the past affected  and could in the future affect  our impairment charges to write down the carrying value of purchased intangibles and the amount of related periodic amortization expense recorded for definite lived intangibles  the valuation of the veloce consideration which affects operating expenses  and an evaluation of other than temporary impairment of our investments  which affects the amount and timing of write down charges 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for stock based compensation and revenue recognition 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
investments we hold a variety of securities that have varied underlying investments 
we review our investment portfolio periodically to assess for other than temporary impairment 
we assess the existence of impairment of our investments in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
the factors used to determine whether an impairment is temporary or other than temporary involves considerable judgment 
the factors we consider in determining whether any individual impairment is temporary or other than temporary are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the nature of underlying assets including the degree of collateralization  the financial condition  credit rating  market liquidity conditions and near term prospects of the issuer 
if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the balance sheet date  an assessment would have to be made as to whether the impairment is other than temporary 
if we decided to sell the security  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
however  if we do not intend to sell the debt security  we shall consider available evidence to assess whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis due to cash  working capital requirements  contractual or regulatory obligations indicate that the security will be required to be sold before a forecasted recovery occurs 
if it is more likely than not that we are required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is considered to have occurred 
if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security  we would not be able to assert that we will recover its amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security 
therefore  in those situations  an other than temporary impairment shall be considered to have occurred 
we use present value cash flow models to determine whether the entire amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered 
we will compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security 
an other than temporary impairment is said to have occurred if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less 
table of contents than the amortized cost basis of the security 
in the fiscal year ended march   we did not record any other than temporary impairment charges 
as of march   we did not record an impairment charge in connection with other securities in a continuous loss position fair value less than carrying value with unrealized losses of million as we believe that such unrealized losses are temporary 
in addition  we also had million in unrealized gains 
for the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of zero and million  respectively 
veloce consideration we periodically evaluate the progress of the development work that is performed by our vie  veloce  in connection with our contractual arrangement with veloce 
based on such an evaluation as well as considering various other qualitative factors  we assess the estimated timing and probability of attaining certain performance milestones 
upon assessing a milestone as probable of achievement  the expense that is recognized considers the stage of product development and estimating the performance metrics that will be achieved 
the consideration that we will pay for each performance milestone is based upon the timing and the performance metrics that will ultimately be achieved 
significant judgment is required to assess estimated timing and the probability of achieving the performance milestones and determining the amount of expense to be recognized 
based on our assessment as of march   we concluded that one of the milestones was probable of being attained and accordingly we recognized million of research and development expense 
our probability determination included both an evaluation of the current stage of product development and the remaining risks associated with attaining completion of the milestone 
the amount of expense recognized included consideration of our revised contractual arrangement with veloce which was executed on april  and for which we have committed to pay million upon the occurrence of certain events which are expected to occur during the first quarter of fiscal the additional performance milestones included in our contractual arrangement that was in effect as of march  are not considered probable of being achieved 
no expense was recognized in connection with these milestones during any of the periods presented 
inventory valuation our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for future demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and net operating results 
any impairment charges taken establishes a new cost basis for the underlying inventory and the cost basis for such inventory is not marked up on changes in circumstances until a gain is realized upon its eventual sale 
this accounting is consistent with the guidance provided by sab topic bb 
to illustrate the sensitivity of inventory valuations to future estimates  as of march   reducing our future demand estimate to six months would decrease our current inventory valuation by approximately million or increasing our future demand forecast to months would not have any significant effect on our current inventory valuation 
purchased definite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of an asset or asset group is not recoverable if the 
table of contents amount of undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate including any net proceeds expected from the disposal of the asset are less than its carrying value 
when we identify an impairment has occurred  we reduce the carrying value of the assets to its comparable market value if available and appropriate or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on four basic criteria there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until the applicable customer s acceptance criteria have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment 
our standard terms and conditions of sale do not allow for product returns and we generally do not allow product returns other than under warranty or stock rotation agreements 
revenue from shipments to distributors is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated allowances such as returns not pursuant to contractual rights  competitive pricing programs and rebates 
these estimates are based on our experience with stock rotations and the contractual terms of the competitive pricing and rebate programs 
royalty revenues are recognized when cash is received  only when royalty amounts cannot be reasonably estimated 
royalty revenues are based upon sales of our customer s products that include our technology 
shipping terms are generally fca free carrier shipping point 
if actual returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  we would record additional reductions to revenue 
from time to time we generate revenue from the sale of our internally developed ip 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of ip when all basic criteria outlined above are met  which is generally when the payments are received 
mask costs we incur significant costs for the fabrication of masks used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our products 
if we determine  at the time the cost for the fabrication of masks are incurred  that technological feasibility of the product has been achieved  we consider the nature of these costs to be pre production costs 
accordingly  such costs are capitalized as property and equipment under machinery and equipment and are amortized as cost of sales over approximately three years  representing the estimated production period of the product 
if we determine  at the time fabrication mask costs are incurred  that either technological feasibility of the product has not occurred or that the mask is not reasonably expected to be used in production manufacturing or that the commercial feasibility of the product is uncertain  the related mask costs are expensed to r d in the period in which the costs are incurred 
we will also periodically assess capitalized mask costs for impairment 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  total mask costs capitalized was million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  are required to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments  excluding rsus  which we use the fair market value of our common stock 
the fair values generated by the black scholes model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected 
table of contents by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date by equally weighting the historical volatility and the implied volatility of our stock over specific periods of time as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from those estimated 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
we currently estimate when and if performance based grants will be earned 
if the awards are not considered probable of achievement  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if we consider the award to be probable  expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent that our assumptions are incorrect  the amount of stock based compensation recorded will be increased or decreased 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  representing a decrease of from the net revenues of million for the fiscal year ended march  we classify our revenues into two categories based on the markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are computing and connectivity previously called process and transport 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets 
see the following tables dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  increase decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue computing connectivity during the fiscal year ended march   our computing revenues declined by while our connectivity revenues declined by 
the overall revenue decline was spread across both the computing and connectivity product families and was as a result of lower demand for our products due to overall softness in the macro conditions 
in addition  the revenues for our connectivity products were lower due to the delay in the overall otn infrastructure build out and the impact of the end of licensing revenues related to the sale of ip to qualcomm 

table of contents gross profit 
the following table presents net revenues  cost of revenues and gross profit for the fiscal years ended march  and dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  increase decrease change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue net revenues cost of revenues gross profit the gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended march  decreased to  compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in our gross profit percentage  excluding the impact of amortization of purchased intangibles  was and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the decrease in our gross profit percentage was primarily due to an overall decline in both computing and connectivity product margins arising out of lower licensing revenues  unfavorable product mix and declining average selling prices 
the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in cost of revenues during the fiscal year ended march  was million  compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to certain purchased intangible assets being fully amortized during the fiscal year ended march  resulting in a lower amortization charge in the current fiscal year ended march  future acquisitions of businesses may result in substantial additional charges  which may impact the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table presents research and development and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the fiscal years ended march  and dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  increase change amount of net revenue amount of net revenue research and development selling  general and administrative research and development 
increases in research and development r d expenses are primarily driven by the effect of the merger and consolidation of veloce  our vie  our internal costs related to the arm bit silicon server development effort  and the costs relating to tpack  an entity we acquired in september  offset by a decrease in other r d expenses 
total consolidated r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs including stock based compensation of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
we recorded an initial consideration of million as of march  relating to the veloce merger as the consummation of this merger was considered probable as of this date 
for accounting purposes  the initial consideration of million is considered a compensatory r d expenditure as the merger consideration is primarily to acquire the r d employees of veloce which will be paid out in cash or equity  or a combination thereof  at the discretion of the company 
assuming that the acquisition of veloce occurs in june  approximately million to million of the million will be payable upon the closing of the acquisition  and the remaining portion of the million will be payable upon the completion of certain post closing development milestones and the continued vesting of time based veloce common stock and other equity awards 
additional purchase consideration will be recorded and amortized in future periods  if and when the additional development milestones are achieved 
refer to note for further details relating to veloce 

table of contents the increase in r d expenses of for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to million for the veloce accrued liability and increases of million in personnel cost  million in stock based compensation charges  million in consumable equipment and software cost  million in technology access fees  million in corporate allocation expense offset by a decrease of million in third party foundry cost  million decrease in development cost related to new products and million in printed circuit board costs 
we believe that a continued commitment to r d is vital to our goal of maintaining a leadership position with innovative products 
in addition to our internal r d programs  our business strategy includes acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
future acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses may result in substantial additional on going r d costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including stock based compensation  professional and legal fees  corporate branding and facilities expenses 
the decrease in sg a expenses of for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to a million reversal of certain acquisition related contingencies and reductions relating to million of acquisition related expenses  million in contractor costs  million in travel and entertainment  million in marketing costs offset by an increase of million corporate allocation expense  million in stock compensation expense and million in professional service fees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and a decline in the stock market 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us treasury  corporate bonds  commercial paper  mortgage backed and asset backed securities  and closed end bond funds  with credit ratings as specified in our investment policy 
we also have invested in preferred stocks  which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
at march   our investment portfolio included short term securities classified as available for sale investments with an aggregate fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate risk  as well as credit risk and liquidity risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase or an issuer s credit rating or financial condition is weakened 

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our short term investments held at march  in thousands valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps fair value as of march  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps bps available for sale investments the modeling technique used measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points  basis points  and basis points 
while this modeling technique provides a measure of our exposure to market risk  the current economic turbulence could cause interest rates to shift by more than basis points 
we also invest in equity instruments of private companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are valued based on our historical cost  less any recognized impairments 
the estimated fair values are not necessarily representative of the amounts that we could realize in a current transaction 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars  and as a result  we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we did not enter into any forward currency exchange contract during the fiscal year ended march  gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period
