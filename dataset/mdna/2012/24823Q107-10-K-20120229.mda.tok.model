our product portfolio includes active cellular immunotherapy and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
provenge sipuleucel t is our only commercialized product licensed by the united states food and drug administration fda  and is a first in class autologous cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic  metastatic  castrate resistant hormone refractory prostate cancer 
commercial sale of provenge began in may in january  we announced plans to seek marketing authorization for the sale of provenge in europe 
prostate cancer is the most common non skin cancer among men in the united states  with over one million men currently diagnosed with the disease  and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men in the united states 
we own worldwide rights for provenge 

table of contents we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was billion and our net loss for the year ended december  was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing and facility expenses  costs associated with the commercial launch of provenge and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and research efforts 
we anticipate that near term we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from available cash  including proceeds from our january convertible notes offering  and revenue generated from commercial sales of provenge 
however there can be no assurance that available cash and cash generated through current operations will be sufficient to continue to conduct our operations and expand according to our business plans 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of the commercialization of provenge 
even if we are able to successfully realize our commercialization goals for provenge  because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with commercialization of a biologic  we are unable to predict when we will become profitable  if at all 
even if we do produce revenues and achieve profitability  we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability 
revenue generated from the sale of provenge since fda approval on april  is million  including million in product sales during during  we supported commercial sale of provenge from the available capacity at our manufacturing facility in morris plains  new jersey the new jersey facility 
on march   the fda approved the remainder of the new jersey facility for the commercial manufacture of provenge 
in addition  on june  the fda approved our facility in orange county  california the orange county facility for the commercial manufacture of provenge and on august  the fda approved our facility in atlanta  georgia the atlanta facility for the commercial manufacture of provenge 
the approval of the additional capacity in our new jersey facility and two new facilities in california and georgia significantly increased our manufacturing capacity and geographic coverage for the supply of provenge 
approximately infusion sites had been authorized by us for treatment using provenge as of the end of on june   the centers for medicare and medicaid services the cms issued a final national coverage determination ncd for provenge  completing the analysis commenced one year prior and requiring medicare contractors to cover the use of provenge for on label use 
the ncd standardized coverage processes across the country for all medicare patients with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate resistant hormone refractory prostate cancer and provides the local medicare administrative contractors macs specific criteria  consistent with the label  on how provenge should be covered 
provenge was issued a product specific q code effective july   which allows for electronic submission of claims 
during november  cms also updated their coverage policy for provenge to cover the infusion costs associated with the administration of provenge  making coverage for provenge consistent with all other infused biologics 
on august   as a result of a decrease in anticipated revenue growth in  we announced plans to reduce expenses  including workforce related expenses  to align with our near term manufacturing requirements 
on september   our board of directors approved a reduction in force of approximately of our total workforce  or approximately employees 
the employees affected by the reduction in force were notified the week of september  on september  we provided written notice to glaxosmithkline llc gsk of termination of our development and supply agreement  effective october  this agreement was originally entered into as a potential second source for the commercial production and supply of the antigen used in the manufacture of provenge 
as part of the workforce reduction and contract termination  we recorded a charge of million for the year ended december  related to severance  other termination benefits and outplacement services  non cash stock compensation due to the accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock awards of certain employees  contract termination costs and other associated costs 
in january  we announced plans to seek marketing authorization for the sale of provenge in europe 
following a number of pre submission meetings with european union national agencies  we expect 
table of contents that data from our phase db impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study  supported by data from our d and da studies  will be sufficient to seek regulatory approval for provenge in the eu using clinical data contained in our united states biologics license application  we filed our marketing authorization application maa with the european medicines agency ema  which was validated on january  to accelerate the regulatory timeline  we will initially manufacture product for our maa through a contract manufacturing organization 
we anticipate a regulatory decision from the eu in mid as of december   our manufacturing operations employed approximately individuals and our commercial team included approximately individuals employed in sales  marketing  and market access support 
other potential product candidates we have under development include our investigational active cellular immunotherapy  dn  directed against her neu for the treatment of patients with bladder  breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
in december we filed an investigational new drug application with the fda for dn for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma  including bladder cancer following surgical resection  and we enrolled our first patient in this trial in september active cellular immunotherapies directed at carbonic anhydrase ca  an antigen highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma  and carcinoembryonic antigen cea  an antigen expressed in colorectal and other cancers  are in pre clinical development 
we are also developing an orally available small molecule targeting trpm that could be applicable to multiple types of cancer in advanced cancer patients 
we completed our phase clinical trial initiated in to evaluate trpm and are in the process of analyzing the data 
critical accounting estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates that could have reasonably been used would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue primarily from the sale of provenge 
revenue from the sale of provenge is recorded net of product returns and estimated price discounts  including rebates and chargebacks offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and  commencing in the fourth quarter of  to members of group purchasing organizations gpos with which we have contracts 
revenue from sales of provenge is recognized upon our confirmed product delivery to and issuance of the product release form to the physician site 
product returns are limited to those instances in which the provider receives the product but does not infuse the product prior to expiry  either due to timing or the failure of the product to meet specifications and pass site inspection 
due to the limited usable life of provenge of approximately hours from the completion of the manufacturing process to patient infusion  actual return information is known and credited against sales in the month incurred 
as we executed drop shipment agreements with credit worthy third party wholesalers the wholesalers to sell provenge  the wholesalers assume all bad debt risk from the physician site or institution  and no allowance for bad debt is recorded 
under the terms of our distribution agreements  our return policy allows for the 
table of contents return of product that has expired prior to delivery  product that expires prior to infusion  product that is defective or damaged following delivery and product that cannot be infused because it does not otherwise meet specified requirements 
our product is subject to certain required pricing discounts via rebates and or chargebacks pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs  and accordingly our revenue recognition policy requires estimates of rebates and chargebacks 
we have agreements with the cms providing for a rebate on sales to eligible medicaid patients  the public health service phs providing for a chargeback on sales to phs eligible providers  and federal supply schedule fss customers  including the department of veteran affairs and the department of defense  providing for a chargeback on sales to eligible patients 
for sales of our product to eligible medicaid patients  the healthcare provider purchases our product at full price  and then receives a rebate from the state for the amount paid in excess of the contract price 
the state  in turn  invoices us for the amount of the rebate 
estimated rebates payable under medicaid are recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in product sales revenue  and are classified as other accrued liabilities until paid 
our estimate of rebates payable is based on information we gather related to the physician site as well as health insurance information related to the patient being treated 
since there is often a delay between product sale and the processing and payment of the medicaid rebates  we evaluate our estimates regularly  and adjust our estimates as necessary 
chargebacks occur when a contracted healthcare provider purchases our product at fixed contract prices that are lower than the price we charge the wholesalers 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges us back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price paid to the wholesaler by the healthcare providers 
these chargebacks are estimated and recorded in the period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in product sales revenue and trade accounts receivable 
the following table is a roll forward of our accrued chargebacks for the year ended december  in thousands accrued chargebacks balance at december  current provision related to sales made in current period current provision related to sales made in prior period payments credits balance at december  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into agreements with certain gpos which contract for the purchase of provenge on behalf of their members and provide certain contract administration services 
eligible members of the gpos purchase provenge at the wholesaler acquisition cost  and may be entitled to receive a rebate on eligible purchases at the end of each quarter 
estimated rebates payable to gpos are recognized in the same period that the related revenue is recognized  resulting in a reduction in product sales revenue  and are classified as other accrued liabilities until paid 
our estimate of rebates payable is based on information we gather related to sales of our product to eligible gpo members 
royalty revenue in the third quarter of  we began receiving royalties on merck s sales of victrelis tm boceprevir  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  which was approved in may we received royalties on worldwide net sales of boceprevir pursuant to the terms of a license and collaboration agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold this royalty to an unrelated third party for million and recognized the full amount as revenue 
no revenue will be recorded related to this royalty in future periods 
inventory inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method 
inventories consisted of raw materials as of december  and  but we may also have work in process at any given time 
we began capitalizing raw material inventory in mid april  in 
table of contents anticipation of the potential approval for marketing of provenge in the first half of at this time  our expectation of future benefits became sufficiently high to justify capitalization of these costs  as regulatory approval was considered probable and the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
costs incurred prior to mid april were recorded as research and development expense in our statements of operations 
as of april  we had approximately million in inventory  based on our current standard cost  which was previously expensed and could be used for the commercial and clinical manufacture of provenge  training or additional research and development efforts 
as of december   approximately million of our zero cost inventory remained on hand 
we estimate the remaining balance of this inventory will be used in research and commercial operations during the first quarter of as a result  cost of product revenue reflects  and will continue to reflect in the first quarter of  a lower average per unit cost of raw materials 
convertible senior notes due the company s convertible senior notes due the notes  issued in the first quarter of  are convertible at the option of the holder  and we may choose to satisfy conversions  if any  in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  based on a conversion rate initially equal to shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
should a holder of the notes exercise their conversion option during the next twelve month period  it is our intention to satisfy the conversion with shares of our common stock 
the notes are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  debt with conversion and other options 
under asc  issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature and may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the carrying amount of the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was calculated by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at an effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in the company s debt structure 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and resulted in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense through the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the date of conversion 
fair value we measure and report at fair value our cash equivalents and investment securities 
we also measured and reported at fair value our warrant liability  prior to exercise of the warrants in the second quarter of fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability  an exit price  in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities typically recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis include long lived assets measured at fair value due to an impairment assessment under asc  property  plant and equipment  and asset retirement obligations initially measured under asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations 
accounting for stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value and is recognized on the accelerated method as expense over the requisite service period 
the fair value of our stock options is calculated using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense for new awards may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents we also grant restricted stock awards that generally vest and are expensed over a four year period 
in and  we granted restricted stock awards with certain performance conditions to certain executive officers and key employees 
at each reporting date  we are required to evaluate whether achievement of the performance conditions is probable 
compensation expense is recorded over the appropriate service period based upon our assessment of accomplishing each performance provision or the occurrence of other events which may cause the awards to accelerate and vest 
recent accounting pronouncements in  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued two accounting standard updates asu which amend guidance for the presentation of comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity will be eliminated 
although the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under existing guidance 
these asus are effective for us in the first quarter of and retrospective application will be required 
these asus will change our financial statement presentation of comprehensive income but will not impact our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue year ended december  in thousands product revenue royalty revenue collaborative revenue total revenue product revenue of million in and million in resulted from the commercial sale of provenge following fda approval on april  product revenue for reflects approximately eight months of product sales activity 
we expect product revenue to increase in as we expand commercialization 
revenue from the sale of provenge is recorded net of product returns and estimated pricing discounts via rebates and or chargebacks  offered pursuant to mandatory federal and state government programs and to members of gpos 
our revenue recognition requires estimates of rebates and chargebacks each period 
we recorded estimated rebates of approximately million during the year ended december  no rebates were recorded for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded estimated chargebacks of approximately million 
no chargebacks were recorded for the year ended december  in the third quarter of  we began receiving royalties on merck s sales of victrelis tm boceprevir  for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c  which was approved in may we received royalties on worldwide net sales of boceprevir pursuant to the terms of a license and collaboration agreement 
we recorded royalty revenue of million during the year ended december   related to royalties received on sales of this product in the second and third quarters of in the fourth quarter of  we sold this royalty for million to an unrelated third party and recognized the full amount as revenue  as we have no further obligations under the agreement 
no revenue will be recorded related to this royalty in future periods 
collaborative revenue resulted from the recognition of deferred revenue related to a license agreement 

table of contents cost of product revenue year ended december  in thousands cost of product revenue gross profit gross profit is calculated by subtracting cost of product revenue from product revenue 
the increase in cost of product revenue in was due to increased sales of provenge and increased approved manufacturing capacity 
cost of product revenue includes the costs of manufacturing and distributing provenge 
prior to fda approval of these facilities  these costs were classified as selling  general and administrative expense 
upon fda approval of the remaining capacity of the new jersey facility in march  the orange county facility in june and the atlanta facility in august  all commercial manufacturing costs at these facilities are included in cost of product revenue 
costs related to the manufacture of provenge for clinical patients are classified as research and development expense 
we incurred substantial costs associated with the portion of the new jersey facility that was not operational during the first quarter of and the year ended december   as well as at the orange county facility for the first half of and the atlanta facility into the third quarter of we began capitalizing raw material inventory in mid april  in anticipation of the potential approval for marketing of provenge in the first half of at this time  our expectation of future benefits became sufficiently high to justify capitalization of these costs  as regulatory approval was considered probable and the related costs were expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
costs incurred prior to mid april were recorded as research and development expense in our statements of operations 
as of april  we had approximately million in inventory  based on our current standard cost  which was previously expensed and could be used for the commercial and clinical manufacture of provenge  training or additional research and development efforts 
as of december   approximately million of our zero cost inventory remained on hand 
we estimate the remaining balance of this inventory will be used in research and commercial operations during the first quarter of as a result  cost of product revenue reflects  and will continue to reflect in the first quarter of  a lower average per unit cost of raw materials 
gross margins on new product introductions generally increase over the life of the product as utilization of capacity increases and manufacturing efforts on product cost reduction are successful 
as we expand our product distribution  we anticipate cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue will decline in future years 

table of contents research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in expenses related to our research and development activities are categorized as either costs associated with clinical programs  discovery research or contract manufacturing expenses 
our research and development expenses were as follows year ended december  in millions clinical programs direct costs indirect costs total clinical programs contract manufacturing expenses discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical programs include wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses  including stock based compensation  rent  utilities and other facilities related maintenance costs 
costs attributable to contract manufacturing expenses include technology transfer and process development costs related to developing second source suppliers 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
our current product candidates and potential targets for the focus of new product candidates in research and development include dn  our investigational active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with bladder  breast  ovarian and other solid tumors expressing her neu 
in december  we filed an ind application with the fda for dn for the treatment of her urothelial carcinoma  including bladder cancer  following surgical resection 
the trial will randomize patients to dn or standard of care  with a primary endpoint of overall survival 
we enrolled our first patient in this trial in september targeted enrollment is approximately patients at clinical sites throughout the united states 
ca and cea  antigen targets for the study of potential active cellular immunotherapies  currently both in pre clinical development 
trpm transient receptor potential  sub family m  a target for manipulation by small molecule drug therapy 
we are developing an orally available  small molecule targeting trpm that could be applicable to multiple types of cancer in advanced cancer patients 
we completed our phase clinical trial initiated in to evaluate trpm and are in the process of analyzing the data 
for the years ended december   and  research and development costs incurred related to these product candidates and potential targets were as follows year ended december  in millions dn ca trpm 
table of contents research and development costs associated with cea for each period presented were immaterial 
the significant majority of our historical research and development expense has been in connection with provenge in the united states 
in we commenced work in connection with our intention to seek approval of provenge for marketing in the eu research and development costs associated with provenge in the united states for each period presented  and associated with provenge in the eu in  were as follows year ended december  in millions provenge united states provenge european union the nature and efforts required to complete a prospective research and development project are typically indeterminable at very early stages when research is primarily conceptual and may have multiple applications 
once a focus towards developing a specific product candidate has been developed  we obtain more visibility into the efforts that may be required to reach conclusion of the development phase 
however  there are inherent risks and uncertainties in developing novel biologics in a rapidly changing industry environment 
to obtain approval of a product candidate from the fda  we must  among other requirements  submit data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate 
in most cases  this entails extensive laboratory tests and pre clinical and clinical trials 
the collection of this data  as well as the preparation of applications for review by the fda and other regulatory agencies outside the united states  is costly in time and effort  and may require significant capital investment 
we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain fda approvals or approvals to market products in foreign markets 
for example  the fda or the equivalent in jurisdictions outside the united states may determine that our data is not sufficiently compelling to warrant marketing approval and may require that we engage in additional clinical trials or provide further analysis which may be costly and time consuming 
regardless of the nature of our efforts to complete development of our products and receive marketing approval  we may encounter delays that render our product candidates uncompetitive or otherwise preclude us from marketing products 
we may be required to obtain additional funding to complete development of product candidates or in order to commercialize approved products 
however such funding may not be available to us on terms we deem acceptable or at all 
our ability to access additional capital is dependent on the success of our business and the perception by the market of our future business prospects 
in the event we were unable to obtain necessary funding  we might halt or temporarily delay ongoing development projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consisted of salaries and wages  stock based compensation  consulting fees  sales and marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include the expenses associated with the portion of the new jersey facility which was not commercially operational during the first quarter of and the year ended december   the orange county facility for the first half of and the atlanta facility into the third quarter of  and related costs of personnel in training 
the significant increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in as compared to  and as compared to  was primarily attributable to higher payroll costs from increased headcount and commercial product launch activities  including non operational manufacturing capacity 
each of our facilities requires approval by the fda prior to the manufacture of provenge for clinical or commercial manufacture  and accordingly  are not operational until such approval 
we incurred pre operational 
table of contents costs associated with the portion of the new jersey facility which was not commercially operational during the first quarter of  the orange county facility for the first half of and the atlanta facility into the third quarter of these costs include facilities related expenditures prior to fda approval  administrative costs associated with training personnel and training a workforce to operate the facility upon fda approval  as well as the cost of outside consultants and other administrative expenses 
in addition  we have incurred start up costs related to the transfer of technology and training at the facilities 
pre operational costs incurred at the facilities and related to start up activities for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
similar costs are classified as cost of product revenue when the related commercial operations commence 
restructuring and contract termination expenses restructuring on august   as a result of a decrease in anticipated revenue growth in  we announced plans to reduce expenses  including workforce related expenses  to align with our near term manufacturing requirements 
on september   our board of directors approved a reduction in force of approximately of our total workforce  or approximately employees 
the employees affected by the reduction in force were notified the week of september  as a result of this workforce reduction  we recorded a charge of million related to severance  other termination benefits  outplacement services and non cash stock compensation due to the accelerated vesting of options and restricted stock awards of certain employees 
the amount is included in restructuring and contract termination in the statement of operations for the year ended december  we do not expect to incur additional restructuring charges in related to severance and other termination benefits in connection with the september restructuring 
we expect to pay the amounts owed within the next three months 
contract termination on september  we provided written notice to gsk of termination of our development and supply agreement  effective october  the agreement was originally entered into as a potential second source for the commercial production and supply of the antigen used in the manufacture of provenge 
we terminated the agreement due to unforeseen delays and implementation difficulties experienced by gsk in achieving the commercial purpose of the agreement 
assets included in our prepaid expense and other current assets balance related to the agreement were deemed unusable and  as such  we incurred an expense of million  included in restructuring and contract termination in the statement of operations for the year ended december  as the manufacturing phase had not yet commenced  and as no production runs or product batches had been initiated as of september   all previously issued product orders were cancelled 
as a result of the contract termination  we recorded a charge of million for the year ended december  the amount is included in restructuring and contract termination in the statement of operations for the year ended december  refer to item for further discussion of a legal proceeding related to this matter 
interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest income in was primarily due to increased holdings of cash and investments as a result of the net proceeds of million realized from the offering of our notes in january and february the slight increase in interest income in as compared to was primarily due to higher average investment balances during interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in interest expense in as compared to was due to the issuance of our notes in the first quarter of  which resulted in non cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance 
table of contents costs of million for the year ended december  in addition  we incurred interest expense of million for the year ended december   based on the stated coupon rate of our notes 
refer to liquidity and capital resources financings from the sale of securities and issuance of convertible notes for further discussion of the accounting for our notes 
the decrease in interest expense in compared to was primarily due to increased capitalized interest expense in related to the construction of our manufacturing facilities 
warrant liability non operating loss associated with the increase in our warrant liability for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the fair value was calculated using the bsm model and was revalued at each reporting period and at the date of exercise in may therefore the fair value of the warrants will have no future impact on our results of operations 
income taxes we recognized million in income tax benefit in relating to refundable credits  compared with no income tax expense or benefit in or as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately billion and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development credit carryforwards r d credits of approximately million and million  respectively 
the nols and r d credits expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the nols and r d credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of nols and r d credits before utilization 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
significant components of our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards  research credits and stock based compensation 
our total deferred tax assets of million and million at december  and  respectively  have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the deferred tax assets have been offset by a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance relates primarily to net deferred tax assets from operating losses 
excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises are recorded directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
as a result  the excess tax benefits included in net operating loss carryforwards  but not reflected in deferred tax assets  for fiscal years and are million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation expense we recorded stock based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for  and as follows year ended december  in millions cost of product revenue research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring 
table of contents total stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for  and increased our net loss per share by  and  respectively 
the increase in stock based compensation expense in and was primarily related to increased headcount and the increased valuation of stock options and restricted stock awards granted in and in the first half of as a result of our increased stock price 
liquidity and capital resources cash uses and proceeds as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity and convertible debt securities  cash receipts from collaborative agreements  interest income  commercial sale of provenge and  most recently  the sale of the boceprevir royalty 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures related to operating activities in these periods were a result of costs associated with the commercial launch of provenge in and  research and development expenses including clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs and selling  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in and  as compared to  resulted from expenses associated with the commercial launch of provenge including working capital needs to support increased inventory and increased selling  general and administrative expense  primarily as a result of an increase in personnel from as of december  to  as of december  and to  as of december  this increase in net cash used in operating activities in was offset by cash received from the commercial sale of provenge and the sale of the boceprevir royalty in the fourth quarter of net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment of million in were substantially higher than million in and million in  due to expenditures for the three manufacturing facility build outs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in was due to the offering of our notes  from which we realized net proceeds of approximately million 
cash provided by financing activities in was due to the exercise of the warrants in exchange for million shares of common stock  resulting in aggregate cash proceeds of million 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the absence of any public offerings in  while cash provided from common stock issuances in may and december resulted in net proceeds of million 
we believe that our current cash on hand as of december   together with revenue generated from commercial sales of provenge and the reduced levels of spending following the restructuring during the third quarter of  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months as we expand our operations  continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  potentially invest in commercial infrastructure outside the united states and invest in research and product development 
the majority of our resources continue to be used in support of the commercialization of provenge in the united states 
we expect revenue from provenge product sales could be a significant source of cash 
however  we may need to raise additional funds to meet potential long term liquidity needs including continued investment in marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge in the united states  continuing and expanding our internal research and development programs  engaging in clinical trials outside of the united states  commercial infrastructure development and other investment in order to support the commercialization of provenge in territories outside the united states  and working capital needs

on january   we entered into the first supplemental indenture the supplemental indenture with the bank of new york mellon trust company  na  as trustee the trustee  to our existing base indenture the base indenture and  together with the supplemental indenture  the indenture  dated as of march  the indenture sets forth the rights and provisions governing the notes 
interest is payable on the notes semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  beginning on july  record dates for payment of interest on the notes are each january and july the notes are convertible at the option of the holder  and we may choose to satisfy conversions  if any  in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  based on a conversion rate initially equal to shares of our common stock per  principal amount of the notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion rate 
table of contents will be increased under certain circumstances described in the indenture  however  the number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of a note will not exceed per  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in accordance with the indenture 
should a holder exercise their conversion option during the next twelve month period  it is our intention to satisfy the conversion with shares of our common stock 
consequently  the notes are classified as a long term liability as of december  the conversion rate will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events  including stock dividends or share splits  the issuance of rights  options or warrants  spin offs or other distributed property  cash dividends or distributions  or tender offers or exchange offers 
we will not make an adjustment to the conversion rate for any transaction described above other than share split or share combination if each holder of the notes has the right to participate in such transaction at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of our common stock  and solely as a result of holding the notes  without having to convert the notes and as if a number of common shares were held equal to the applicable conversion rate multiplied by the principal amount of notes held 
the notes are subject to repurchase by us at the option of the holders following a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture 
if a fundamental change occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due thereon 
however  if a fundamental change occurs and a holder elects to convert the notes  we will under certain circumstances  increase the applicable conversion rate for the notes surrendered for conversion by a number of additional shares of common stock  based on the date on which the fundamental change occurs or becomes effective and the price paid per share of our common stock in the fundamental change as specified in the indenture 
at our option  we will satisfy our conversion obligation with cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares  unless the consideration for our common stock in any fundamental change is comprised entirely of cash  in which case the conversion obligation will be paid in cash 
the number of additional shares of common stock was determined such that the fair value of the additional shares would be expected to approximate the fair value of the convertible option at the date of the fundamental change 
in addition  we may from time to time increase the conversion rate  to the extent permitted by law  by any amount for any period of time if the period is at least business days and we provide business days prior written notice of such increase 
in addition  we may increase the conversion rate if the board of directors determines that such increase would avoid or diminish united states federal income tax to holders of the common stock in connection with a dividend or distribution 
the indenture contains customary covenants 
the notes are accounted for in accordance with asc  under which issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was calculated by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at an effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in the company s debt structure 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and resulted in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
the debt discount is being amortized as interest expense through the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the date of conversion 
the application of asc resulted in the initial recognition of million as the debt discount recorded in additional paid in capital for the notes 
at december   the net carrying amount of the liability component  which is recorded as a long term liability in the consolidated balance sheet  was million  and the remaining unamortized debt discount was million 
amortization of the debt discount and debt issuance costs for the year ended december  resulted in non cash interest expense of million 
in addition  interest expense based on the stated coupon rate of the notes was million for the year ended december  
table of contents notes in  an aggregate of million of the notes was sold in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers 
proceeds from the offering  after deducting placement fees and our estimated expenses  were approximately million 
the notes were issued at face principal amount and pay interest of semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
record dates for payment of interest on the notes are each june and december in certain circumstances  additional amounts may become due as additional interest 
we can elect that the sole remedy for an event of default for our failure to comply with the reporting obligations provisions of the indenture under which the notes were issued the indenture  for the first days after the occurrence of such event of default would be for the holders of the notes to receive additional interest on the notes at an annual rate equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the notes 
we recorded interest expense  including the amortization of debt issuance costs  related to the notes of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the notes are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder  initially at the conversion price of per share  equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment 
there may be an increase in the conversion rate of the notes under certain circumstances described in the indenture  however  the number of shares of common stock issued will not exceed per  principal amount of the notes 
the notes are subject to repurchase by us at the option of the holder following a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture 
if a fundamental change occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts due thereon 
however  a holder that converts notes in connection with a fundamental change may  in some circumstances  be entitled to an increased conversion rate ie  a lower per share conversion price as a make whole premium 
the increased conversion rates were determined such that the fair value of the additional shares would be expected to approximate the fair value of the convertible option at the date of the fundamental change 
in addition  the conversion rate will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events  including stock dividends or share splits  the issuance of rights or warrants  other distribution of property  cash dividends or distributions  or tender offers or exchange offers 
we will not make an adjustment to the conversion rate for any transaction described above other than share split or share combination if each holder of the notes has the right to participate in such transaction at the same time and upon the same terms as holders of our common stock  and solely as a result of holding the notes  without having to convert the notes and as if a number of common shares were held equal to the applicable conversion rate multiplied by the principal amount of notes held
