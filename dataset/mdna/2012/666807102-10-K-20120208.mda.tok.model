item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview notable events certain notable events or activities affecting our consolidated financial results included the following significant financial events for the year ended december  n we completed the spin off of our shipbuilding business huntington ingalls industries or hii  which is now reported within discontinued operations 
n in connection with the spin off of hii  we received cash of billion 
n we reduced our participation in the national security technologies nstec joint venture  which resulted in a billion reduction in contract backlog and a million reduction in revenues 
n we repaid notes with a face value of million 
n we made voluntary pension funding contributions totaling billion 
n we repurchased million shares of common stock for a total of billion 
n in the second quarter of  we increased the quarterly stock dividend from per share to per share 
n we paid million in cash dividends 
other notable events for the year ended december  n we relocated our corporate offices in los angeles  california and in rosslyn  virginia to our new corporate office in falls church  virginia 
n we increased the authorization for share repurchases by approximately billion 
political and economic environment the us and global economies have experienced a period of substantial economic uncertainty and turmoil  with high levels of national debt  and the related financial markets have been characterized by significant volatility 
current levels of deficit spending in the us could prove to be unsustainable over the long term 
although defense spending is expected to remain a national priority within future federal budgets  the passage of the budget control act of the budget control act in august marked a growing political acceptance of cutting planned defense spending as part of a deficit reduction solution 
some allied government defense spending has also come under increasing pressure as governments search for ways to reduce their deficits and national debts 
the administration and congress will likely continue to debate the size of the new defense budget plan for the next decade  but spending over the next several years is expected to drop measurably from previously planned levels  absent a significant national security event 
future defense plans and changes in defense spending levels could adversely affect the individual programs and delay purchasing by our customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations  and or cash flows 
while these significant budgetary considerations put downward pressure on growth in our industry  we believe that our business is well positioned in areas that the dod has indicated are areas of focus for future defense spending to help the dod meet its critical future capability requirements for protecting us security and the security of our allies in the years to come 
the budget control act raised the statutory limit on the amount of permissible federal debt and committed the us government to reduce significantly the federal deficit in the coming decade 
the budget control act consists of two parts  both of which could impact future defense spending levels 
the first part mandates a total reduction of billion to the fiscal year presidential budget submission as part of established caps on discretionary spending through of this total reduction  approximately billion is expected to come from defense spending 
the budget control act also set up a joint committee of congress the joint committee that 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation was responsible for identifying an additional to trillion in deficit reductions by november  the joint committee was unable to identify the additional deficit reductions by this deadline thereby triggering a second provision of the budget control act called sequestration  which calls for very substantial automatic spending cuts split between defense and non defense programs that will start in and continue over a nine year period 
both the administration and many members of congress have indicated that sequestration is not the preferred path to deficit reduction and that alternative steps should be pursued 
while we believe efforts may be underway to prevent the automatic spending cuts scheduled to begin in  the outcome of these efforts is uncertain 
the fiscal year defense budget provides a nominal increase in base funding over fiscal year levels 
we anticipate continued debate over defense spending with the president s budget request for fiscal year and the subsequent congressional budget process 
the forthcoming general election in november is expected to generate significant additional political dialogue centered around the federal deficit and potential cuts in government spending 
budget decisions made in this environment could have long term consequences for our company and the entire defense industry 
we expect us force levels and budget resources tied to current hostilities to continue to draw down 
as overall defense spending is reduced  the dod is re evaluating the role and structure of the military 
the dod recently released a new defense strategy that resulted from a comprehensive review intended to guide its priorities and budgeting decisions 
the new guidance indicates the us military needs to project power globally and operate effectively in all domains  including cybersecurity  and it places particular emphasis on the asia pacific region as an area of strategic focus 
in january  the secretary of defense announced a number of program changes and cancellations that are scheduled to take place over the next several years in part to comply with certain provisions of the budget control act 
certain of these program changes and cancellations will have an impact on programs in which we participate 
the us is expected to continue to maintain a range of powerful military capabilities to support us national security interests  even amidst economic difficulties and reductions in defense spending levels  and consequently we expect the us will continue to need many of the sophisticated capabilities that we provide 
we believe our portfolio aligns well with the dod s indicated requirements  and  as a result  we believe we are well positioned to help the dod meet its critical future capability requirements for protecting us security in the years ahead 
although reductions to individual programs in which we participate or for which we expect to compete are always possible such as the recent announcements regarding the block global hawk and f programs  we believe that spending on recapitalization  modernization and maintenance of defense  intelligence  and homeland security assets will continue to be a national priority 
future defense spending is expected to include the development and procurement of new manned and unmanned military platforms and systems along with advanced electronics and software to enhance the capabilities of individual systems and provide real time integration of individual surveillance  information management  strike  and battle management platforms 
given the current era of irregular warfare  we expect increased investment in persistent awareness with intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance isr systems  cyber warfare  and an expansion of information available for the warfighter to make timely decisions 
we expect other significant new competitive opportunities to include long range strike  directed energy applications  missile defense  satellite communications systems  restricted programs  cybersecurity  technical services and information technology contracts  and numerous international and homeland security programs 
we believe that the us government will continue to place a high priority on defense spending and national security  as well as economic challenges  and will continue to invest in sophisticated systems providing long range surveillance and intelligence  battle management  precision strike  and strategic agility 
in addition  the us government continues to face challenges with recapitalizing equipment and rebuilding readiness while also pursuing modernization and reducing overhead and inefficiency

green initiatives we could be affected by future laws or regulations  including but not limited to  those enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions known as green initiatives 
in  we established a goal of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions over a five year period through december  in  we established goals for water usage and solid waste generation 
to comply with laws  regulations  and green initiatives  including our goals  we have incurred and expect to incur capital and operating costs  but at this time  such costs have not had  and we do not expect that such costs will have  a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
business dispositions we completed the spin off to our shareholders of hii effective march  hii operates the business that was previously the shipbuilding segment shipbuilding of the company prior to the spin off 
the spin off was the culmination of the company s decision to explore strategic alternatives for shipbuilding as it was determined to be in the best interests of shareholders  customers  and employees to allow both the company and shipbuilding to pursue more effectively their respective opportunities to maximize value 
we made a pro rata distribution to our shareholders of one share of hii common stock for every six shares of our common stock held on the record date of march   or million shares of hii common stock 
there was no gain or loss recognized by the company as a result of the spin off transaction 
in connection with the spin off  hii issued senior notes and entered into a credit facility with third party lenders  and hii used a portion of the proceeds of the notes and credit facility to fund a billion cash contribution to us 
sales for shipbuilding for the three months ended march   were billion and sales for the years ended december  and  were billion and billion  respectively 
the assets  liabilities and operating results of this business unit are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
we sold our advisory services division asd in december  for billion in cash to an investor group led by general atlantic  llc and affiliates of kohlberg kravis roberts co 
lp  and recognized a gain of million  net of taxes 
asd was a business unit comprised of the assets and liabilities of tasc  inc  its wholly owned subsidiary tasc services corporation  and certain contracts carved out from other businesses also in information systems that provide systems engineering technical assistance seta and other analysis and advisory services 
sales for asd in the year ended december  was approximately billion

government contracts typically include the following major cost elements material  labor  overhead  subcontract costs  and general and administrative costs 
unless otherwise specified in a contract  costs billed to contracts with the us government are determined under the requirements of the federal acquisition regulation far and cas regulations as allowable and allocable costs 
examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the us government in accordance with the requirements of the far and cas regulations include  but are not limited to  certain legal costs  lobbying costs  charitable donations  interest expense and advertising costs 
our long term contracts typically fall into one of two broad categories flexibly priced contracts flexibly priced contracts include both cost type and fixed price incentive contracts 
cost type contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs incurred plus a fee that represents profit 
cost type contracts generally require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and some stated dollar limitation 
fixed price incentive contracts also provide for reimbursement of the contractor s allowable costs up to a ceiling amount  but are subject to a cost share limit that affects profitability 
fixed price incentive contracts effectively become firm fixed price contracts once the cost share limit is reached 
firm fixed price contracts a firm fixed price contract is a contract in which the specified scope of work is agreed to for a price that is a pre determined  negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor 
time and materials contracts are considered firm fixed price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged 
the following table summarizes revenue recognized by contract type and customer in millions us government other customers total percent of total flexibly priced contracts firm fixed price contracts total sales and service revenues 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation contract fees negotiated contract fee structures  for both flexibly priced and fixed price contracts include  but are not limited to fixed fee amounts  cost sharing arrangements to reward or penalize for either under or over cost target performance  positive award fees  and negative penalty arrangements 
profit margins may vary materially depending on the negotiated contract fee arrangements  the achievement of performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under incentive and award fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees certain contracts contain provisions consisting of award fees based on performance criteria such as cost  schedule  quality  and technical performance 
award fees are determined and earned based on an evaluation by the customer of the company s performance against negotiated criteria 
award fees that can reasonably be estimated and are deemed reasonably assured  are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
award fee contracts are used in certain of our operating segments 
compliance and monitoring we monitor our policies and procedures with respect to our contracts on a regular basis to enhance consistent application under similar terms and conditions  as well as compliance with all applicable government regulations and laws 
in addition  costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the us government are routinely audited by the defense contract audit agency 
critical accounting policies  estimates  and judgments revenue recognition overview we derive the majority of our business from long term contracts for the production of goods and services provided to the federal government  which are accounted for in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap for construction type and production type contracts and federal government contractors 
we classify contract revenues as product sales or service revenues depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contract 
we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the federal government  such as contracts to provide certain services to non federal government customers 
we account for those contracts in accordance with the relevant gaap revenue recognition principles 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when determining the proper accounting method for a particular contract 
percentage of completion accounting we generally recognize revenues from our long term contracts under the cost to cost or the units of delivery measures of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
for most contracts  sales are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
under percentage of completion accounting  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on each contract s percentage of completion 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires us to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products and services 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge of our engineers  program managers and financial professionals  and draws on their significant experience and judgment 
such costs are typically incurred over a period of several years  and estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
many contracts contain positive and negative profit incentives based upon performance relative to predetermined targets that may occur during or subsequent to delivery of the product 
these incentives take the form of potential additional fees to be earned or penalties to be incurred 
incentives and award fees that can be reasonably assured and reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract 
incentives and award fees that are not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded or at such time as we believe a reasonable estimate can be made 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation changes in estimates of contract sales  costs  and profits are recognized using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
this method recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
hence  the effect of the changes on future periods of contract performance is recognized as if the revised estimate had been the original estimate 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain service contracts we generally recognize revenue under contracts to provide services to non federal government customers when services are performed 
service contracts include operations and maintenance contracts  and outsourcing type arrangements  primarily in technical services and information systems 
we generally recognize revenue under such contracts on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these service contracts are expensed as incurred  except that direct and incremental set up costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
operating profit related to such service contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
contracts that include more than one type of product or service are accounted for under the relevant gaap guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple elements 
accordingly  for applicable arrangements  revenue recognition includes the proper identification of separate units of accounting and the allocation of revenue across all elements based on relative fair values 
cost estimation the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge of our engineers  program managers and financial professionals  and draws on their significant experience and judgment 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability  productivity and cost of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the recoverability of any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
we update our contract cost estimates at least annually and more frequently as determined by events or circumstances 
we generally review and reassess our cost and revenue estimates for each significant contract on a quarterly basis 
we record a provision for the entire loss on the contract in the period the loss is determined when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned 
we offset loss provisions first against costs that are included in unbilled accounts receivable or inventoried assets  with any remaining amount reflected in liabilities 
purchase accounting overview we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair market values  with the excess recorded as goodwill 
such fair market value assessments require judgments and estimates that can be affected by contract performance and other factors over time  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 
adjustments to the fair value of purchased assets and liabilities after the initial measurement period are recognized in net earnings 
acquisition accruals we establish certain accruals in connection with indemnities and other contingencies from our acquisitions and divestitures 
we have recorded these accruals and subsequent adjustments during the purchase price allocation period for acquisitions and as events occur for divestitures 
the accruals are determined based upon the terms of the purchase or sales agreements and  in most cases  involve a significant degree of judgment 
we record these accruals based on our interpretation of the terms of the purchase or sale agreements  known facts  and an estimation of probable future events based on our experience  which may cause final amounts to differ materially from original estimates 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation goodwill and other intangible assets we perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of november th  or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets should be evaluated 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment  whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
when testing goodwill  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we primarily use the income approach based on the cash flows that the reporting unit expects to generate in the future 
this income valuation method requires management to project revenues  operating expenses  working capital investment  capital spending and cash flows for the reporting units over a multi year period  as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital wacc used as a discount rate and the terminal value assumptions 
the wacc takes into account the relative weights of each component of our consolidated capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted as appropriate to consider lower risk profiles associated with longer term contracts and barriers to market entry 
the terminal value assumptions are applied to the final year of the discounted cash flow model 
impairment assessment inherently involves management judgments as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill  differences in assumptions may have a material effect on the results of our impairment analysis 
we also corroborate the fair values determined under the income approach using the market valuation method to estimate the fair value of our reporting units by utilizing industry multiples including relevant control premiums of operating earnings 
when calculating impairment for intangible assets with indefinite lives  we compare the fair value of these assets  as determined based on the income and market valuation methods  to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit s individual assets and liabilities and calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment evaluation 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying value 
there were no impairment charges recorded in the years ended december   and litigation  commitments  and contingencies we are subject to a range of claims  investigations  lawsuits  environmental matters  income tax matters  and administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment based upon professional knowledge and experience of management and our internal and external legal counsel 
in accordance with our practices relating to accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to record a charge to earnings and  if so  what amount based on consideration of the facts and circumstances of each matter as then known to us  including any settlement offers  and our assessment of the probability of the liabilities and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure to us may vary materially from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances develop or become known to us 
when we believe  based on the facts available to us  that a liability is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable  we record our best estimate of the amount of the ultimate loss 
when a range of costs is reasonably estimable  but no amount within that range is a better estimate than another  we record what we estimate as the lower end of the range 
for further information on the treatment of these contingencies  see note  note and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item us government cost claims from time to time  our customers advise us of ordinary course claims and penalties concerning certain potential disallowed costs 
when such findings are presented  we engage us government representatives in discussions to enable us to evaluate the merits of these claims  as well as to assess the amounts being claimed 
where appropriate  provisions are made to reflect our expected exposure to matters raised by the us government representatives 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation income taxes provisions for federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pre tax income based on current tax law and include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes 
state and local income and franchise tax provisions are allocable to contracts in process and  accordingly  are included in operating income 
uncertain tax positions tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized in the financial statements 
if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties  the company recognizes an expense for the amount of the penalty in the period it is determined 
the company recognizes federal interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense 
federal penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item retirement benefits overview we record our employee pension and other post retirement plans in accordance with us gaap under financial accounting standards fas and charge the costs of these plans to our contracts with customers in accordance with the far and the related cost accounting standards cas that govern such plans 
in measuring periodic pension cost  both fas and cas recognize a normal services cost component  but there are differences in the way the remaining components of annual pension costs are calculated under each method  including the assumptions and methods used for measuring the plan obligations 
as a result  retiree benefit plan expense amounts for fas purposes are different from the amounts for cas purposes 
further  differences result from different methodologies in how estimated earnings on pension assets and interest expense on the pension obligations are measured  and the measurement and allocation periods over which gains losses related to pension assets and actuarial changes are determined 
cas pension expense is allocated to our segments and is included in their measurement of segment operating income  and the difference between the cas and fas pension expense is recorded in operating income at the consolidated company level 
recent developments in us government cost accounting standards pension recovery rules on december  the cas board published a final rule revising cas  composition and measurement of pension cost  and cas  adjustment and allocation of pension cost 
these revisions are intended to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of defined benefit pension plan costs allocable to us government contracts  and the minimum required contribution under the employee retirement income security act of erisa  as amended by the pension protection act ppa of we anticipate that the rule will better align  but not eliminate  mismatches between erisa funding requirements and cas pension costs for us government cas covered contracts 
under the final rule  there is a five year transition period  during which an increasing percentage of the harmonization effect is to be recognized  starting from in the first year to in the fifth year and thereafter 
the rule becomes effective february   with being the first year of applicability for the revised accounting practices required by the rule 
price proposals for cas covered contracts awarded on or after the effective date of february   will reflect the effects of the rule 
we believe for cas covered contracts awarded prior to the effective date  contractors will be entitled to an equitable adjustment for any additional cas basis contract costs resulting from implementation of the final rule 
fas benefit plan assumptions we perform an annual evaluation of the assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for our pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans in consultation with our outside actuaries 
in the event that we determine that plan amendments or changes in the assumptions are warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease 
the principal assumptions that have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate and the estimated fair market value of plan assets 
for certain plan assets where the fair market value is not readily determinable  such as real estate  private equity  and hedge funds  estimates of fair value are determined using the best information available 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and post retirement benefit obligations 
the discount rate is generally based on the yield of high quality corporate fixed income investments 
at the end of each year  the discount rate is primarily determined using a portfolio of high quality bonds matching the notional cash inflows with the expected benefit payments for each significant benefit plan 
taking into consideration the factors noted above  our weighted average pension composite discount rate was percent at december   and percent at december  holding all other assumptions constant  and since net actuarial gains and losses were in excess of the percent accounting corridor in  an increase or decrease of basis points in the discount rate assumption for would have decreased or increased pension and post retirement benefit expense for by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits  and decreased or increased the amount of the benefit obligation recorded at december   by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits 
the effects of hypothetical changes in the discount rate for a single year may not be representative and may be asymmetrical or nonlinear for future years because of the application of the accounting corridor 
the accounting corridor is a defined range within which amortization of net gains and losses is not required 
expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets represents the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested in a specified target asset allocation to provide for anticipated future benefit payment obligations 
for and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
an increase or decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return assumption for  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease our pension and post retirement benefit expense for by approximately million  of which million relates to post retirement benefits 
for pension and post retirement benefit plan purposes  we have assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent 
health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on external estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
using a combination of market expectations and economic projections including the effect of health care reform  we selected an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent for and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in in  we assumed an expected initial health care cost trend rate of percent for and an ultimate health care cost trend rate of percent reached in although our actual cost experience is much lower at this time  market conditions and the potential effects of health care reform are expected to increase medical cost trends in the next one to three years thus our past experience may not reflect future conditions 
differences in the initial through the ultimate health care cost trend rates within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on post retirement benefit results in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease increase decrease from change in health care cost trend rates to post retirement benefit expense post retirement benefit liability 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation consolidated operating results selected financial highlights are presented in the table below year ended december in millions sales and service revenues cost of sales and service revenues general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense charge on debt redemption federal and foreign income tax expense cash provided by continuing operations operating performance assessment and reporting we manage and assess the performance of our businesses based on our performance on individual contracts and programs two or more closely related contracts generally obtained from government organizations using the financial measures referred to below  with consideration given to the critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments described above in part ii  item as indicated in our discussion on contracts above in part ii  item  our portfolio of long term contracts is largely flexibly priced  which means that sales tend to fluctuate in concert with costs across our large portfolio of active contracts  with operating income being a critical measure of operational performance 
due to far rules that govern our business  most types of costs are allowable  and we do not focus on individual cost groupings such as manufacturing  engineering  and design labor costs  subcontractor costs  material costs  overhead costs  and general and administrative costs  as much as we do on total contract costs  which is the key driver of both revenue and operating income 
in any given reporting period  each of our segments manages numerous contracts that provide for the delivery of products or services to our customers 
our contract management process involves the use of contract estimates at completion eacs that are generally prepared and evaluated on a bottoms up basis at least annually and reviewed on a quarterly basis over the performance period of the contract 
these eacs include an estimated contract operating income margin rate based initially on the contract award amount  adjusted to reflect estimated risks related to contract performance 
these risks typically include technical risk  schedule risk and performance risk based upon our evaluation of the contract effort 
similarly  the eacs include identified opportunities for operating income margin rate improvement 
over the performance period of the contract  our program management organizations perform recurring evaluations of contract performance and adjust the contract revenue and cost estimates over the life of the contract to reflect the latest reliable information available 
our business and program management organizations are comprised of a large cadre of skilled professional managers who utilize our contract administration and management control systems with the objective of successfully overseeing our contract performance to satisfy the customer s expectations  deliver high quality products and services  and manage contract risks and opportunities to achieve an appropriate operating income margin rate on the contract 
our comprehensive business and contract management process involves personnel from the planning  production control  contracts  cost management  supply chain and program and business management functions 
as part of this overall contract management function  these personnel monitor compliance with our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting and compliance with u 
s 
government regulations 
as a result  contract operating income and period to period contract operating income margin rates are adjusted over the contract performance period to reflect changes in the risks and opportunities affecting the contract  and adjustments may have a favorable or unfavorable effect on operating income margin depending upon the specific conditions affecting each contract 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation in evaluating our operating performance  we look primarily at changes in sales and service revenues  and operating income  including the effects of meaningful changes in operating income as a result of changes in contract estimates and the use of the cumulative catch up method of accounting in accordance with gaap 
where applicable  unusual fluctuations in operating performance attributable to changes in a specific cost element across multiple contracts are described in our analysis 
based on this approach and the nature of our operations  the discussion of results of operations generally focuses around our four segments versus distinguishing between products and services 
sales and service revenues sales and service revenues consist of the following year ended december in millions product sales service revenues sales and service revenues sales and service revenues for decreased  million  or percent  as compared to  reflecting lower sales at all four operating segments 
product sales for decreased  million  or percent  as compared to  primarily due to lower sales volume on space and manned aircraft programs at aerospace systems and lower sales volume in land and self protection systems at our electronic systems segment 
service revenues for decreased million  or percent  as compared to  primarily due to the reduced participation by the technical services segment in the nstec joint venture effective january   resulting in no sales recorded for the joint venture in  compared to million in  and lower sales volume on defense and civil systems at the information systems segment

table of contents northrop grumman corporation product sales at information systems decreased in volume by approximately primarily due to million in sales volume that transitioned from product to service activity in electronic systems product sales volume decreased million during the period  and product cost of sales decreased by million reflecting performance improvement in land and self protection programs  higher volume in targeting systems  and lower operating loss provisions in postal automation programs 
cost of segment service revenues cost of service revenues in decreased by million and basis points as a percentage of service revenues as compared to  due to the overall decline in sales for the period and margin rate improvements at information systems  technical services and electronic systems  offset somewhat by an unfavorable margin rate change at aerospace systems 
contributing to the overall decline in revenues was the company s participation in the nstec joint venture  which resulted in the deconsolidation of this business in nstec contributed revenues of million and segment cost of sales of million in when it was included in technical service s sales  thus driving a basis point improvement in margin rate for this segment 
more modest margin rate improvements at electronic systems and information systems effectively offset the decline in margin rate at the aerospace systems business 
cost of segment service revenues of billion in was up over by million due to increased volume  which resulted in an increase in sales from billion in to billion in the sales volume increase was due principally to technical services contract volume  driven by the kc and c contracts  which together increased by million 
segment service margin rates across all segments improved in  with information systems being the primary contributor as it experienced higher margin rates at its civil systems division  and due to the absence of non recurring costs of million from the sale of asd in overall  information systems experienced a basis point margin rate improvement 
unallocated corporate expenses unallocated corporate expenses generally include the portion of corporate expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas and far rules  and therefore not allocated to the segments  such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation and retiree benefits  and other expenses 
unallocated corporate expenses for decreased million  or percent  as compared with  primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation 
unallocated corporate expenses for increased million  or percent  as compared with  primarily due to inclusion of a million net gain from a legal settlement in  as well as an increase in environmental  health and welfare  and stock based compensation expenses in net pension adjustment net pension adjustment reflects the difference between pension expenses determined in accordance with gaap and pension expense allocated to the operating segments determined in accordance with cas 
for and  the net pension adjustment resulted in income of million and million  respectively 
the increase in net pension adjustment for both years is due to decreased gaap pension expense  primarily resulting from higher estimated returns on higher pension plan assets as of the beginning of the year 
royalty income adjustment royalty income is included in segment operating income and reclassified to other income for financial reporting purposes 
general and administrative expenses in accordance with industry practice and the regulations that govern the cost accounting requirements for government contracts  most general corporate expenses incurred at both the segment and corporate locations are considered allowable and allocable costs on government contracts 
for most components of the company  these costs are allocated to contracts in progress on a systematic basis and contract performance factors therefore include this cost component as an element of cost 
general and administrative expenses primarily relate to segment operations 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation general and administrative expenses for decreased million  or percent  compared to  primarily due to overall reductions in administrative costs due to cost reduction initiatives  lower bid and proposal costs and lower research and development expenses

table of contents northrop grumman corporation segment operating results basis of presentation we are aligned into four reportable segments aerospace systems  electronic systems  information systems and technical services 
see note in part ii  item for more information about our segments 
in january  we transferred our internal information technology services unit from the information systems segment to our corporate shared services group 
the intersegment sales and operating income for this unit that were previously recognized in the information systems segment are immaterial and have been eliminated for the years presented

changes in sales and service revenues are typically expressed in terms of volume 
unless otherwise described  volume generally refers to increases or decreases in reported revenues incurred due to varying production activity levels  delivery rates  or service levels on individual contracts 
volume changes will typically carry a corresponding operating income change based on the margin rate for a particular contract 
segment operating income segment operating income reflects the aggregate performance results of contracts within a business area or segment 
excluded from this measure are certain costs not directly associated with contract performance  including 
table of contents northrop grumman corporation the portion of corporate expenses such as management and administration  legal  environmental  certain compensation costs and other retiree benefits  and other expenses not considered allowable or allocable under applicable cas regulations and the far  and therefore not allocated to the segments 
changes in segment operating income are typically expressed in terms of volume  as discussed above  or performance 
performance refers to changes in contract margin rates for the period 
these changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract eac that reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance on a particular contract 
operating income changes are accounted for on a cumulative catch up basis at the time an eac change is recorded 
we identify favorable and unfavorable adjustments to determine our qualitative discussion of performance results and  where meaningful  we disclose the effects of such adjustments on a contract or program basis 
operating income may also be affected by  among other things  the effects of workforce stoppages  natural disasters such as earthquakes  resolution of disputed items with the customer  recovery of insurance proceeds  and other discrete events 
at the completion of a long term contract  any originally estimated costs not incurred or reserves not fully utilized such as warranty reserves could also impact contract earnings 
where such items have occurred and the effects are meaningful  a separate description is provided 
changes in estimates related to our contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method are recorded using the cumulative catch up method of accounting 
the aggregate effects of these favorable and unfavorable changes across our portfolio of numerous contracts can have a significant effect upon our reported sales and operating income in each of our reporting periods 
in  and  we recognized favorable operating income adjustments of billion  million and million  and unfavorable operating income adjustments of million  million and million  respectively  consisting of cumulative catch up adjustments from the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting

backlog definition total backlog at december   was approximately billion 
total backlog includes both funded backlog firm orders for which funding is contractually obligated by the customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding is not currently contractually obligated by the customer 
unfunded backlog excludes unexercised contract options and unfunded indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq orders except for authorized task orders  which are included up to the authorized value 
for multi year services contracts with non federal government customers having no stated contract values  backlog includes only the amounts committed by the customer 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation the following table presents funded and unfunded backlog by segment for the year ended december  and total backlog for the year ended december  in millions funded unfunded total backlog total backlog aerospace systems electronic systems information systems technical services total backlog backlog is converted into the following years sales as costs are incurred or deliveries are made 
approximately percent of the billion total backlog at december   is expected to be converted into sales in total us government orders  including those made on behalf of foreign governments  comprised percent of the total backlog at the end of total foreign customer orders accounted for percent of the total backlog at the end of domestic commercial backlog represented percent of total backlog at the end of backlog adjustments in the fourth quarter of  we changed our backlog measurement criteria to include a valuation adjustment for open  unfulfilled contracts that in our judgment  may not be converted to future sales  but which have not been closed or de obligated by the customer 
under our prior criteria  backlog represented remaining work effort to be incurred on signed contracts in process  or open contract value generally related to either work scope not fully utilized by the customer  and open contract value related to the close out of overhead claim years 
based on this prior criteria  backlog was reduced as revenue was recognized or as the customer took contract action to close contracts and or de obligate funds 
our recent experience indicates that our customers have not been timely in taking the aforementioned contract actions 
accordingly  effective december   we have modified our criteria to include the recognition of a valuation reserve to adjust our outstanding backlog to reflect our future contract revenue expectations 
the effects of this change in procedures reduced december  backlog by billion  including a reduction in the backlog at information systems by billion and technical services by million 
total backlog was reduced by billion at technical services to reflect a change in the company s participation in the nstec joint venture effective january   at which time the nstec joint venture results were no longer consolidated into the company s consolidated financial statements 
total backlog was also reduced by an aggregate of billion at aerospace systems to reflect restructuring and termination of certain space programs 
a billion reduction in backlog was recorded in as a result of the restructure of the npoess program at our aerospace systems segment 
backlog was also impacted in by an agreement we reached with the commonwealth of virginia related to the vita contract 
the agreement defined minimum revenue amounts for the remaining years under the base contract and extended the contract for three additional years through we recorded a favorable backlog adjustment of million for the definitization of the base contract revenues for years through  while the contract extension and portion of the base contract revenues  totaling million  were recorded as new awards in the period in our information systems segment

liquidity and capital resources we endeavor to ensure the most efficient conversion of operating results into cash for deployment in growing our businesses and maximizing shareholder value 
we actively manage our capital resources through working capital improvements  capital expenditures  strategic business acquisitions and divestitures  debt issuance and repayment  required and voluntary pension contributions  returning cash to our shareholders through dividend payments  and repurchases of common stock 
in addition to our cash position  we use various financial measures to assist in capital deployment decision making  including  but not limited to  cash provided by operations  free cash flow  and debt to ebitda ratio 
we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our financial performance 
as of december   the amount of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities held outside of the us by foreign subsidiaries was million 
at the present time  we do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations 
the table below summarizes key components of operating cash flow for continuing operations year ended december in millions net earnings earnings from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of business charge on debt redemption other non cash items retiree benefit funding less than in excess of expense trade working capital change cash provided by continuing operations includes depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred taxes 
free cash flow free cash flow from continuing operations is a non gaap financial measure and is calculated as cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures and outsourcing contract and related software costs 
outsourcing contract and related software costs are similar to capital expenditures in that the contract costs represent incremental external costs or certain specific internal costs that are directly related to the contract acquisition and transition set up 
these outsourcing contract and related software costs are deferred and expensed over the contract s period of performance 
we believe free cash flow from continuing operations is a useful measure for investors to consider 
this measure is a key factor in our planning for and consideration of strategic acquisitions  stock repurchases and the payment of dividends 

table of contents northrop grumman corporation free cash flow from continuing operations is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner 
this measure should not be considered in isolation  as a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes  or as an alternative to operating results presented in accordance with gaap as indicators of performance

in  pension plan contributions totaled billion  of which billion was voluntarily pre funded 
in  we expect to contribute the required minimum funding level of approximately million to our pension plans and approximately million to our other post retirement benefit plans 
we expect our cash on hand and cash generated from operations for to be sufficient to service debt and contract obligations  finance capital expenditures  continue acquisition of shares under the share repurchase program  and continue paying dividends to our shareholders 
although cash from operations is expected to be sufficient to service these obligations  we may borrow under credit facilities to accommodate timing differences in cash flows 
we have an aggregate commitment of billion available under two revolving credit facilities that can be accessed on a same day basis 
both facilities are currently undrawn and had no borrowings during the year ended december  additionally  we believe we could access capital markets for debt financing for longer term funding  under current market conditions  if needed

credit facilities in september  the company entered into two senior unsecured credit facilities the credit agreements in an aggregate principal amount of billion 
the first credit agreement amended the company s billion five year credit facility dated august   by reducing the aggregate principal amount available under the facility by million to billion and extending the maturity date to september the second credit agreement is a new day revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the credit agreements contain covenants substantially similar to those of the previous five year credit facility  which restrict the company s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets  merge or consolidate with another entity or undertake other fundamental changes and incur liens 
the company also cannot permit the ratio of its consolidated debt to capitalization as set forth in the credit agreements to exceed percent 
the company is in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreements 
at december   there was no balance outstanding under either of these credit facilities 
other sources and uses of capital additional capital we believe we can obtain additional capital  if necessary for long term liquidity  from such sources as the public or private capital markets  the sale of assets  sale and leaseback of operating assets  and leasing rather than purchasing new assets 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the sec 
we expect that cash on hand at the beginning of the year plus cash generated from continuing operations supplemented by borrowings under credit facilities and in the capital markets  if needed  will be sufficient in to service debt and contract obligations  finance capital expenditures  pay federal  foreign  and state income taxes  fund required and voluntary pension and other post retirement benefit plan contributions  continue acquisition of
