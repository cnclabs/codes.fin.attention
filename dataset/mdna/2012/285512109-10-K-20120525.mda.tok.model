item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a high level discussion of our operating results  as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute game software content and services that can be played by consumers on a variety of platforms  including video game consoles such as the sony playstation  microsoft xbox  and nintendo wii  personal computers  mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones  tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle  and the internet 
our ability to publish games across multiple platforms  through multiple distribution channels  and directly to consumers online and wirelessly has been  and will continue to be  a cornerstone of our product strategy 
we have generated substantial growth in new business models and alternative revenue streams such as subscription  micro transactions  and advertising based on the continued expansion of our online and wireless platform 
some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  battlefield  mass effect  need for speed  the sims  bejeweled  and plants v 
zombies  and some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  fifa  madden nfl  and star wars the old republic 
our goal is to turn our core intellectual properties into year round businesses available on a range of platforms 
our products and services may be purchased through physical and online retailers  platform providers such as console manufacturers and mobile carriers via digital downloads  as well as directly through our own distribution platform  including online portals such as origin and playfree 
financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was  million  up million as compared to the fiscal year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by million as compared to march   directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march  at march   deferred net revenue associated with sales of online enabled packaged goods and digital content increased by million as compared to march   directly reducing the amount of reported net revenue during the fiscal year ended march  without these changes in deferred net revenue  reported net revenue would have increased by approximately million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenue for fiscal year was driven by fifa  battlefield and madden nfl net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to a diluted loss per share of for the fiscal year ended march  net income increased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of a million increase in gross profit due to a decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content and a greater percentage of net revenue from ea studio and digital products  which have higher margins than our co publishing and distribution products and a million decrease in restructuring and other charges 
the increase in net income was partially offset by a million increase in marketing and sales costs  a million increase in research and development costs  and a million increase in general and administrative costs 

table of contents trends in our business digital content distribution and services 
consumers are spending an ever increasing portion of their money and time on interactive entertainment that is accessible online  or through mobile digital devices such as smart phones  or through social networks such as facebook 
we provide a variety of online delivered products and services including through our origin platform 
many of our games that are available as packaged goods products are also available through direct online download through the internet 
we also offer online delivered content and services that are add ons or related to our packaged goods products such as additional game content or enhancements of multiplayer services 
further  we provide other games  content and services that are available only via electronic delivery  such as internet only games and game services  and games for mobile devices 
advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving devices that are being used to play games by an ever broadening base of consumers 
we have responded to these advances in technology and consumer acceptance of digital distribution by offering different sales models  such as subscription services  online downloads for a one time fee  micro transactions and advertising supported free to play games and game sites 
in addition  we offer our consumers the ability to play a game across platforms on multiple devices 
we significantly increased the revenues that we derive from wireless  internet derived and advertising digital products and services from million in fiscal year to  million in fiscal year and we expect this portion of our business to continue to grow in fiscal and beyond 
wireless and other emerging platforms 
advances in technology have resulted in a variety of platforms for interactive entertainment 
examples include wireless technologies  streaming gaming services  and internet platforms 
our efforts in wireless interactive entertainment are focused in downloadable games for mobile devices 
these platforms grow the consumer base for our business while also providing competition to existing established video game platforms 
we expect sales of games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 
growth of casual and social games 
the popularity of wireless and other emerging gaming platforms such as smart phones  tablets and social networking sites  such as facebook  has led to the growth of casual and social gaming 
casual and social games are characterized by their mass appeal  simple controls  flexible monetization including free to play and micro transaction business models  and fun and approachable gameplay 
these games appeal to a larger consumer demographic of younger and older players and more female players than video games played on console devices 
these areas are among the fastest growing segments of our sector and we have responded to this opportunity by developing casual and social games based on our established intellectual properties such as the sims  fifa and battlefield  and with our acquisition of popcap games 
we expect sales of casual and social and casual games for wireless and other emerging platforms to continue to be an important part of our business 
concentration of sales among the most popular games 
we see a larger portion of packaged goods games sales concentrated on the most popular titles  and those titles are typically sequels of prior games 
we have responded to this trend by significantly reducing the number of games that we produce to provide greater focus on our most promising intellectual properties 
we published primary packaged goods titles in fiscal year  in fiscal year and in fiscal year  we expect to release primary packaged goods titles and plan to build additional online features  content and services around each of these titles 
evolving sales patterns 
our business has evolved from a traditional packaged goods business model to one where our games are played on a variety of platforms including mobile devices and social networking sites 
our strategy is to transform our core intellectual properties into year round businesses  with a steady flow of downloadable content and extensions on new platforms 
our increasingly digital  multi platform business no longer reflects the retail sales patterns associated with traditional packaged goods launches 
for example  we offer our consumers additional services and or additional content available through online services to further enhance the gaming experience and extend the time that consumers play our games after their initial purchase 
our social and casual games offer free to play and micro transaction models 
we also offer subscription based products  such as our mmo role playing game star wars the old republic 
the revenues we derive from these services has become increasingly more significant year over year 
our service revenue represented percent  percent  and percent of total net revenue in fiscal year   and  respectively 

table of contents recent developments stock repurchase program 
in february  we announced that our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over the next months 
we completed our program in april we repurchased approximately million shares in the open market since the commencement of the program  including pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans 
during the fiscal year  we repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million  net of commissions 
international operations and foreign currency exchange impact 
international sales revenue derived from countries other than canada and the united states  are a fundamental part of our business 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year and approximately percent of our total net revenue during fiscal year our net revenue is impacted by foreign exchange rates during the reporting period associated with net revenue before revenue deferral  as well as the foreign exchange rates associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of online enabled packaged goods and digital content that were established at the time we recorded this deferred net revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 
the foreign exchange rates during the reporting period may not always move in the same direction as the foreign exchange rate impact associated with the recognition of deferred net revenue of online enabled packaged goods and digital content 
during the fiscal year ended march   foreign exchange rates had an overall favorable impact on our net revenue of approximately million  or percent 
in addition  our international investments and our cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  then foreign exchange rates may have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations and our financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both management judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we derive revenue principally from sales of interactive software games on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wii and pcs  on mobile devices such the apple iphone and google compatible android phones  on tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle  and from software and content and online game services associated with these products 
we evaluate revenue recognition based on the criteria set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  as revised by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we classify our revenue as either product revenue or service and other revenue 
we evaluate and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement 
evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products must be present 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
for services  delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided 
fixed or determinable fee 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 

table of contents collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and management judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report in each period 
changes to any of these assumptions and judgments  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
multiple element arrangements we enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which we may provide a combination of game software  updates or additional content and online game services 
for some software products we may provide updates or additional content digital content to be delivered via the internet that can be used with the original software product 
in many cases we separately sell this digital content for an additional fee 
in other transactions  we may have an obligation to provide incremental unspecified digital content in the future without an additional fee ie  updates on a when and if available basis or we may offer an online matchmaking service that permits consumers to play against each other via the internet 
collectively  we refer to these as software related offerings 
in those situations where we do not require an additional fee for the software related offerings  we account for the sale of the software product and software related offerings as a bundled sale  or multiple element arrangement  in which we sell both the software product and relating offerings for one combined price 
generally  we do not have vsoe for the software related offerings and thus  we defer net revenue from sales of these games and recognize the revenue from the bundled sales games over the period the offering will be provided the offering period 
if the period is not defined  we recognize revenue over the estimated offering period  which is generally estimated to be six months  beginning in the month after delivery 
in addition  determining whether we have an implicit obligation to provide incremental unspecified future digital content without an additional fee can be difficult 
determining the estimated offering period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 
determining whether an element of a transaction constitutes an online game service or a digital content download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult 
the accounting for these transactions is significantly different 
revenue from product downloads is generally recognized when the download is made available assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
revenue from an online game service is recognized as the service is rendered 
if the period is not defined  we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period 
for example  our mmo games have an estimated service period of eighteen months  beginning in the month after delivery 
for our software and software related multiple element arrangements ie  software game bundled with software related offerings  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element is delivered  determine whether the undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  determine whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements 
changes to any of these assumptions and judgments  or changes to the elements in the arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
in some of our multiple element arrangements  we sell tangible products with software and or software related offerings 
these tangible products are generally either peripherals or ancillary collectors items 
prior to april   because either the software or other elements sold with the tangible products were essential to the functionality of the tangible product and or we did not have vsoe for the tangible product  we did not separately account for the tangible product 
on april   we adopted fasb asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
the new accounting principles establish a selling price 
table of contents hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and require the application of the relative selling price method to allocate the arrangement consideration to each deliverable in a multiple element arrangement that includes tangible products 
accordingly for our multiple element arrangements that include tangible products entered into after april   revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each deliverable using the relative selling prices of each deliverable in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy described below 
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the software deliverables as a group and then allocated to each software deliverable in accordance with asc we determine the selling price for a tangible product deliverable based on the following selling price hierarchy vsoe ie  the price we charge when the tangible product is sold separately if available  third party evidence tpe of fair value ie  the price charged by others for similar tangible products if vsoe is not available  or our best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
determining the besp is a subjective process that is based on multiple factors including  but not limited to  recent selling prices and related discounts  market conditions  customer classes  sales channels and other factors 
as the result of adopting asu and asu  for the year ended march   we recognized million more revenue than would have been recognized under previous accounting standards 
we reduce revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
price protection represents the right to receive a credit allowance in the event we lower our wholesale price on a particular product 
the amount of the price protection is generally the difference between the old price and the new price 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc and video game system software products  which allow for the exchange of these software products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange software products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 
in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for our software products 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our software products  current trends in retail and the video game industry  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our software products  and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold software products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing software products 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates change  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
in addition  if our estimates of returns and price protection related to online enabled packaged goods software products change  the amount of deferred net revenue we recognize in the future would change 
significant management judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 

table of contents fair value estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states often requires us to determine the fair value of a particular item in order to fairly present our financial statements 
without an independent market or another representative transaction  determining the fair value of a particular item requires us to make several assumptions that are inherently difficult to predict and can have a material impact on the accounting 
there are various valuation techniques used to estimate fair value 
these include the market approach where market transactions for identical or comparable assets or liabilities are used to determine the fair value  the income approach  which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  future cash flows or future earnings to a single present value amount  and the cost approach  which is based on the amount that would be required to replace an asset 
for many of our fair value estimates  including our estimates of the fair value of acquired intangible assets  we use the income approach 
using the income approach requires the use of financial models  which require us to make various estimates including  but not limited to the potential future cash flows for the asset or liability being measured  the timing of receipt or payment of those future cash flows  the time value of money associated with the expected receipt or payment of such cash flows  and the inherent risk associated with the cash flows risk premium 
making these cash flow estimates are inherently difficult and subjective  and if any of the estimates used to determine the fair value using the income approach turns out to be inaccurate  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  relatively small changes in many of these estimates can have a significant impact to the estimated fair value resulting from the financial models or the related accounting conclusion reached 
for example  a relatively small change in the estimated fair value of an asset may change a conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired 
while we are required to make certain fair value assessments associated with the accounting for several types of transactions  the following areas are the most sensitive to these assessments business combinations 
we must estimate the fair value of assets acquired  liabilities and contingencies assumed  acquired in process technology  and contingent consideration issued in a business combination 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of each of these can have a material effect on our reported results as intangible assets are amortized over various estimated useful lives 
furthermore  a change in the estimated fair value of an asset or liability often has a direct impact on the amount we recognize as goodwill  an asset that is not amortized 
determining the fair value of assets acquired requires an assessment of the highest and best use or the expected price to sell the asset and the related expected future cash flows 
determining the fair value of acquired in process technology also requires an assessment of our expectations related to the use of that asset 
determining the fair value of an assumed liability requires an assessment of the expected cost to transfer the liability 
determining the fair value of contingent consideration issued requires an assessment of the expected future cash flows over the period in which the obligation is expected to be settled  and applying a discount rate that appropriately captures a market participant s view of the risk associated with the obligation 
this fair value assessment is also required in periods subsequent to a business combination 
such estimates are inherently difficult and subjective and can have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
assessment of impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets 
current accounting standards require that we assess the recoverability of our finite lived acquisition related intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is potentially impaired 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management must make various assumptions about the estimated fair value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated future cash flows 
for some assets  our estimated fair value is dependent upon predicting which of our products will be successful 
this success is dependent upon several factors  which are beyond our control  such as which operating platforms will be successful in the marketplace 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
on january   we adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining 
table of contents whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test 
if based on that assessment  we believe it is more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting units is less than its carrying value  a two step goodwill impairment test is required to be performed 
the first step measures for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to the individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
our reporting units are determined by the components of our operating segments that constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
to determine the fair value of each reporting unit used in the first step  we use the market approach  which utilizes comparable companies data  the income approach  which utilizes discounted cash flows  or a combination thereof 
determining whether an event or change in circumstances does or does not indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount is inherently subjective 
each step requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include long term growth rates  tax rates  and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
these estimates and assumptions have to be made for each reporting unit evaluated for impairment 
as of our last annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we concluded that the estimated fair values of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying amounts and we have not identified any indicators of impairment since 
our estimates for market growth  our market share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
our business consists of developing  marketing and distributing video game software using both established and emerging intellectual properties and our forecasts for emerging intellectual properties are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information and have an inherently higher risk of inaccuracy 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
assessment of impairment of short term investments and marketable equity securities 
we periodically review our short term investments and marketable equity securities for impairment 
our short term investments consist of securities with remaining maturities greater than three months at the time of purchase and our marketable equity securities consist of investments in common stock of publicly traded companies  both are accounted for as available for sale securities 
unrealized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  net of tax  until either the security is sold  the security has matured  or we determine that the fair value of the security has declined below its adjusted cost basis and the decline is other than temporary 
realized gains and losses on our short term investments and marketable equity securities are calculated based on the specific identification method and are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income  net  and gains losses on strategic investments  net  respectively 
determining whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary requires management judgment based on the specific facts and circumstances of each security 
the ultimate value realized on these securities is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the credit quality of the issuer  the duration that the fair value has been less than the adjusted cost basis  severity of the impairment  reason for the decline in value and potential recovery period  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investees  and our intent to sell and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  any contractual terms impacting the prepayment or settlement process  as well as  if we would be required to sell an investment due to liquidity or contractual reasons before its anticipated recovery 
our ongoing consideration of these factors could result in impairment charges in the future  which could have a material impact on our financial results 

table of contents assessment of inventory obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand 
we write down inventory based on excess or obsolete inventories determined primarily by future anticipated demand for our products 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and market value  based upon assumptions about future demand that are inherently difficult to assess 
at the point of a loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
adoption of asu on january   we adopted the fasb accounting standards update asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the guidance limits the highest and best use measure to nonfinancial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts 
additionally  the guidance expands the disclosures on level inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure of the unobservable inputs and assumptions  as well as description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs 
adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of products 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of revenue generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on the total projected net revenue for contracts with guaranteed minimums 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors  including the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell  which can be impacted by a number of variables  including product quality  the timing of the title s release and competition  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the amount and timing of royalty expense we recognize 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product  and therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally expensed to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of revenue 
our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments  which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor 
when performance remains with the licensor  we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 
royalty liabilities are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next months 

table of contents each quarter  we also evaluate the expected future realization of our royalty based assets  as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments or losses determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments or losses determined post launch are charged to cost of revenue 
we evaluate long lived royalty based assets for impairment generally using undiscounted cash flows when impairment indicators exist 
unrecognized minimum royalty based commitments are accounted for as executory contracts  and therefore  any losses on these commitments are recognized when the underlying intellectual property is abandoned ie  cease use or the contractual rights to use the intellectual property are terminated 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statement amount and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax losses and tax credit carry forwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that all or a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in making this determination  we are required to give significant weight to evidence that can be objectively verified 
it is generally difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is significant negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
forecasts of future taxable income are considered to be less objective than past results  particularly in light of the economic environment 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
in addition to considering forecasts of future taxable income  we are also required to evaluate and quantify other possible sources of taxable income in order to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets  namely the reversal of existing deferred tax liabilities  the carry back of losses and credits as allowed under current tax law  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
evaluating and quantifying these amounts involves significant judgments 
each source of income must be evaluated based on all positive and negative evidence  this evaluation involves assumptions about future activity 
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law cannot be considered as a source of future taxable income that may be available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 
based on the assumptions and requirements noted above  we have recorded a valuation allowance against most of our us deferred tax assets 
in addition  we expect to provide a valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability or until other significant positive evidence arises that suggest that these benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation  as well as with respect to other matters  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international corporate structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 
we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  and accordingly  no us taxes have been provided thereon 
we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 

table of contents results of operations our fiscal year is reported on a or week period that ends on the saturday nearest march our results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and each contained weeks and ended on march  and april   respectively 
our results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  contained weeks and ended on april  for simplicity of disclosure  all fiscal periods are referred to as ending on a calendar month end 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year net revenue net revenue consists of sales generated from video games sold as packaged goods or as digital downloads and designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wii  and pcs  video games for mobile devices such as the apple iphone and google android compatible phones  video games for tablets and electronic readers such as the apple ipad and amazon kindle  software products and content and online game services associated with these products  programming third party websites with our game content  allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products  and advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 
we provide three different measures of our net revenue 
two of these measures are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue and net revenue by geography 
the third measure is a non gaap financial measure net revenue by revenue composition  which is primarily based on method of distribution 
we use this third non gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance  when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods  and when assessing the performance of our management team 
management places a greater emphasis and focus on assessing our business through a review of the net revenue by revenue composition than by net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue 
these two measures differ as net revenue by product revenue and service and other revenue reflects the deferral and recognition of revenue in periods subsequent to the date of sale due to us gaap while net revenue by revenue composition does not  and both measures contain a different aggregation of sales from one another 
for instance  service and other revenue does not include the majority of our full game digital download and mobile sales that are fully included in our digital revenue 
further  service and other revenue includes all of our revenue associated with mmo games while software sales associated with our mmos are included in either digital revenue or publishing and other revenue depending on whether the sale was a full game digital download or a packaged goods sale

net revenue before revenue deferral  a non gaap financial measure  is provided in this section of md a  including a discussion of the components of this measure publishing and other  wireless  internet derived  and advertising digital  and distribution 
see non gaap financial measures below for an explanation of our use of this non gaap financial measure 
a reconciliation to the corresponding measure calculated in accordance with us gaap is provided in the discussion below 
revenue deferral in this net revenue section includes the unrecognized revenue from bundled sales of software and software related offerings for which we do not have vsoe for the software related offerings  certain sales of mmo games  and entitlements to content that are delivered through hosting services  which are types of micro transactions 
fluctuations in the revenue deferral are largely dependent upon the amounts of products that we sell with the online features and services previously discussed  while the recognition of revenue deferral for a period is also dependent upon the amount deferred  the period of time the software related offerings are to be provided  and the timing of the sale 
for example  most revenue deferrals incurred in the first half of a fiscal year are recognized within the same fiscal year  however  substantially all of the revenue deferrals incurred in the last month of a fiscal year will be recognized in the subsequent fiscal year

this increase was offset by a million decrease in sales primarily from the tetris and warhammer franchises  as well as a decrease in sales generated by our pogo branded online services 
distribution revenue distribution revenue includes sales of game software developed by independent game developers that we distribute and sales through our switzerland distribution business 
for fiscal year  distribution net revenue was million and increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year driven by an million increase in sales in the portal franchise 
this increase was offset by an million decrease primarily driven by a decrease in sales in the rock band franchise 
revenue deferral revenue deferral for fiscal year increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a percent increase in our current year digital sales and a higher percentage of both our publishing and digital sales being deferred and recognized over time  due in part to a percent increase in full game download sales and a percent increase in micro transaction sales  of which both contain an online service component which requires revenue recognition as the service is delivered 
recognition of revenue deferral the vast majority of our sales are deferred and recognized over a six month period  and therefore  the related revenue recognized in any fiscal year is primarily due to sales that occurred during the respective twelve months period ended december the recognition of revenue deferral for fiscal year increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased publishing and digital sales during the twelve months ended december   and a higher percentage of those sales being comprised of games sales that have an online service component  as compared to the same period in fiscal year net revenue for fiscal year  net revenue was  million and increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal year this increase was driven by a  million increase in revenue primarily from the battlefield  crysis  and fifa franchises

revenue deferral includes the unrecognized revenue from bundled sales of software and software related offerings for which we do not have vsoe for the software related offerings  certain sales of mmo games  and entitlements to content that are delivered through hosting services  which are types of micro transactions 
we recognize the revenue from these games over the estimated period 
we believe that excluding the impact of revenue deferral and the recognition of revenue deferral related to games and digital content from our operating results is important to facilitate comparisons between periods in understanding our underlying sales performance for the period  and understanding our operations because all related costs of revenues are expensed as incurred instead of deferred and recognized ratably 
we use this non gaap financial measure internally to evaluate our operating performance  when planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods  and when assessing the performance of our management team 
while we believe that this non gaap financial measure is useful in evaluating our business  this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with gaap

total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue during fiscal year  total cost of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by percent as compared to fiscal year this decrease as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to a greater percentage of net revenue from our digital products  that have a lower cost than our other products  which positively impacted gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by approximately percent and a million decrease in the change in deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods and digital content for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  which positively impacted gross profit as a percent of total net revenue by percent

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was a tax benefit of percent 
in fiscal year we recorded approximately million of additional net deferred tax liabilities related to the popcap and klicknation corporation klicknation acquisitions 
these additional deferred tax liabilities create a new source of taxable income  thereby requiring us to release a portion of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance with a related reduction in income tax expense of million 
in addition  during the three months ended march   we recorded million of additional tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations in non us tax jurisdictions 
consistent with prior years  the fiscal year effective tax rate continues to differ from the statutory rate of percent as a result of the utilization of us deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance and non us profits subject to a reduced or zero tax rate  partially offset by non deductible stock based compensation 
in addition  the fiscal year effective tax rate is impacted by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and the resolution of examinations by taxing authorities  as well as a reduction in the us valuation allowance related to the popcap and klicknation acquisitions 
in fiscal year  the effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of percent primarily due to us losses for which no benefit is recognized  non us losses with a reduced or zero tax benefit and non deductible stock based compensation expenses  partially offset by tax benefits related to the expiration of statutes of limitations and resolution of examination by taxing authorities 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal year and future periods will depend on a variety of factors  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  changes in or termination of our agreements with tax authorities  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in our annual pre tax income or loss 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our pre tax consolidated income or loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income or loss than at higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income or loss  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
certain taxable temporary differences that are not expected to reverse during the carry forward periods permitted by tax law have not been considered as a source of future taxable income that is available to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets

cash provided by operating activities decreased million during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to an increase in expenses due to our online and customer experience initiatives  an increase in personnel related costs from recent acquisitions  and an increase in marketing  advertising and promotional spending on our franchises 
this difference is partially offset by a greater percentage of net revenue from our digital products  which have a higher margin than our other products 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased million during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to a million increase in cash used for acquisitions  the majority of which was used to fund our acquisition of popcap  and a million increase in capital expenditures 
contributing to this increase  we received million in proceeds from the sale of our ubisoft and the investments during the fiscal year ended march  with no comparable sale of our investments during the fiscal year ended march  these items were partially offset by a million increase in proceeds received from the maturities and sales of short term investments  a million increase due to the release of restriction on previously classified restricted cash due to the achievement of certain performance milestones in connection with our acquisition of playfish  a million decrease in the purchase of short term investments  and million proceeds received from the sale of our facility in chertsey  england 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities increased million during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to million in proceeds received from the sale of convertible senior notes due  net of issuance costs and million proceeds received from the issuance of warrants in connection with the notes 
these items were partially offset by a million increase in the repurchase and retirement of our common stock  net of commissions  pursuant to our stock repurchase program and million paid for the purchase of the convertible note hedge 

table of contents short term investments and marketable equity securities due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities  our short term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short term interest rates 
as of march   our short term investments had gross unrealized gains of million  or less than percent of the total in short term investments  and gross unrealized losses of less than million  or less than percent of the total in short term investments 
from time to time  we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities  such as capital expenditures  business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs 
depending on which short term investments we liquidate to fund these activities  we could recognize a portion  or all  of the gross unrealized gains or losses 
the fair value of our marketable equity securities decreased to million as of march  from million as of march  primarily due to a decrease in the value of our investment in neowiz 
restricted cash and contingent consideration as of march   primarily in connection with our acquisitions of popcap  klicknation  and chillingo limited chillingo  we may be required to pay an additional million of cash consideration based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through march  in fiscal year  in connection with our playfish acquisition  we deposited million into an escrow account related to the contingent consideration 
during the three months ended march   million was paid to settle performance milestones earned through december  in connection with the playfish acquisition  and million was reclassified and converted to available cash and cash equivalents 
as of march   million remains in restricted cash related to the playfish performance milestones  which we expect to pay in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  in connection with our popcap acquisition  we acquired an additional million of restricted cash which is held in an escrow account in the event that certain liabilities become due 
as these deposits are restricted in nature  they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents 
as of march   the restricted cash of million is included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
fiscal restructuring in connection with our fiscal restructuring plan  we expect to incur cash expenditures through june of approximately million in both fiscal years and  million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year the actual cash expenditures are variable as they will be dependent upon the actual revenue we generate from certain games 
fiscal restructuring on may   we announced a plan of restructuring to align our cost structure with our ongoing digital transformation 
under this plan  we anticipate reducing our workforce and incurring other costs 
we expect the majority of these actions to be completed by september  in connection with this plan  we anticipate incurring approximately million in total costs  of which approximately million will result in future cash expenditures 
all of these charges are expected to occur during the fiscal year ending march  these costs will consist of severance and other employee related costs approximately million  license termination costs approximately million and other costs approximately million 
financing arrangement in july  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations which pay interest semi annually in arrears at a rate of percent per annum on january and july of each year  beginning on january  and will mature on july   unless earlier purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date 
the notes are convertible into cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion value of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of 
table of contents approximately per share 
upon conversion of the notes  holders will receive cash up to the principal amount of each note  and any excess conversion value will be delivered in shares of our common stock 
we used the net proceeds of the notes to finance our acquisition of popcap  which closed in august prior to april   the notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of certain events and during certain periods  and thereafter  at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes 
the notes do not contain any financial covenants 
the conversion rate is subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest 
following certain corporate events described in the indenture governing the notes the indenture that occur prior to the maturity date  the conversion rate will be increased for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such corporate event in certain circumstances 
the notes are not redeemable prior to maturity  and no sinking fund is provided for the notes 
if we undergo a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  subject to certain conditions  holders may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes 
the fundamental change purchase price will be percent of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the fundamental change purchase date 
the indenture contains customary terms and covenants  including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing  either the trustee or the holders of at least percent in principal amount of the outstanding notes may declare percent of the principal and accrued and unpaid interest on all the notes to be due and payable 
in addition  in july  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions the convertible note hedge with certain counterparties to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the notes 
the convertible note hedge  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  provide us with the option to acquire  on a net settlement basis  approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of  which corresponds to the conversion price of the notes and is equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes 
as of march   we have not purchased any shares under the convertible note hedge 
we paid million for the convertible note hedge 
separately  we have also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions with the certain counterparties whereby we sold to independent third parties warrants the warrants to acquire  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments that are substantially the same as the anti dilution provisions contained in the notes  up to million shares of our common stock which is also equal to the number of shares of our common stock that notionally underlie the notes  with a strike price of 
the warrants could have a dilutive effect with respect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of its common stock exceeds on or prior to the expiration date of the warrants 
we received proceeds of million from the sale of the warrants 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our convertible senior notes due financial condition we believe that cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable equity securities  cash generated from operations and available financing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and potentially  future acquisitions  stock repurchases  or strategic investments 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate expansion  repurchase our stock  pursue strategic acquisitions and investments  and or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
there can be no assurance  however  that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 

table of contents as of march   approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments and million of our marketable equity securities were domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions 
while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term  if we choose to do so  we would be required to accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided

we completed our program in april we repurchased approximately million shares in the open market since the commencement of the program  including pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans 
during the fiscal year  we repurchased and retired approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million  net of commissions

contractual obligations and commercial commitments development  celebrity  league and content licenses payments and commitments the products we produce in our studios are designed and created by our employee designers  artists  software programmers and by non employee software developers independent artists or third party developers 
we typically advance development funds to the independent artists and third party developers during development of our games  usually in installment payments made upon the completion of specified development milestones 
contractually  these payments are generally considered advances against subsequent royalties on the sales of the products 
these terms are set forth in written agreements entered into with the independent artists and third party developers 
in addition  we have certain celebrity  league and content license contracts that contain minimum guarantee payments and marketing commitments that may not be dependent on any deliverables 
celebrities and organizations with whom we have contracts include fifa  fifpro foundation  fapl football association premier league limited  and dfl deutsche fu ball liga gmbh german soccer league professional soccer  national basketball association professional basketball  pga tour  tiger woods and augusta national professional golf  national hockey league and nhl players association professional hockey  national football league properties  players inc  and red bear inc 
professional football  collegiate licensing company collegiate football  espn content in ea sports games  hasbro  inc most of hasbro s toy and game intellectual properties  and lucasarts and lucas licensing star wars the old republic 
these developer and content license commitments represent the sum of the cash payments due under non royalty bearing licenses and services agreements and the minimum guaranteed payments and advances against royalties due under royalty bearing licenses and services agreements  the majority of which are conditional upon performance by the counterparty 
these minimum guarantee payments and any related marketing commitments are included in the table below

b in addition to the interest payments reflected in the table above  we will be obligated to pay the million principal amount of the convertible senior notes due and any excess conversion value in shares of our common stock upon redemption after the maturity of the notes on july  or earlier 
see note for additional information related to our convertible senior notes due the amounts represented in the table above reflect our unrecognized minimum cash obligations for the respective fiscal years  but do not necessarily represent the periods in which they will be recognized and expensed in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the amounts in the table above are presented based on the dates the amounts are contractually due  however  certain payment obligations may be accelerated depending on the performance of our operating results 
in addition to what is included in the table above as of march   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million  of which approximately million is offset by prior cash deposits to tax authorities for issues pending resolution 
for the remaining liability  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
in addition to what is included in the table above as of march   primarily in connection with our popcap  klicknation  and chillingo acquisitions  we may be required to pay an additional million of cash consideration based upon the achievement of certain performance milestones through march  as of march   we have accrued million of contingent consideration on our consolidated balance sheet representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration 
off balance sheet commitments lease commitments as of march   we leased certain of our current facilities  furniture and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
we were required to pay property taxes  insurance and normal maintenance costs for certain of these facilities and any increases over the base year of these expenses on the remainder of our facilities

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and market prices  which have experienced significant volatility in light of the global economic downturn 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign currency option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below 
while we do not hedge our short term investment portfolio  we protect our short term investment portfolio against different market risks  including interest rate risk as discussed below 
our cash and cash equivalents portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original or remaining maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase 
we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our marketable equity securities and we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk cash flow hedging activities 
from time to time  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing foreign currency option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
the gross amount of the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of these hedges is subsequently reclassified into net revenue or research and development expenses  as appropriate  in the period when the forecasted transaction is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the event that the gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are deemed to be ineffective  the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reclassified to interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
in the event that the underlying forecasted transactions do not occur  or it becomes remote that they will occur  within the defined hedge period  the gains or losses on the related cash flow hedges are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the reporting periods  all forecasted transactions occurred and  therefore  there were no such gains or losses reclassified into interest and other income expense  net 
our hedging programs are designed to reduce  but do not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements in net revenue and research and development expenses 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currency 
all of the foreign currency option contracts outstanding as of march  will mature in the next months 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currency and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march   these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of million and are included in other current assets 
as of march   the fair value of these outstanding foreign currency option contracts was immaterial and are included in other current assets 
balance sheet hedging activities 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the foreign currency forward contracts generally have a contractual term of three months or less and are transacted near month end 
our foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments  and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts is reported as other current assets or accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value are reported in interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income expense  net  in our consolidated statements of 
table of contents operations 
in certain cases  the amount of such gains and losses will significantly differ from the amount of gains and losses recognized on the underlying foreign currency denominated monetary asset or liability  in which case our results will be impacted 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars  and million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling 
as of march   we had foreign currency forward contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to purchase foreign currency in exchange for us dollars and million to sell foreign currency in exchange for british pound sterling 
the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and we believe the counterparties to these foreign currency forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material  the disruption in the global financial markets has impacted some of the financial institutions with which we do business 
further  the continued sovereign debt crisis in europe could lead to increased counterparty risk with respect to financial institutions and other business partners  who are particularly vulnerable to the instability in certain european markets 
a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of the disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure credit worthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value of the premiums on our foreign currency option contracts used in cash flow hedging of less than million in each scenario 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would have resulted in potential losses on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of million and million  respectively 
this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift of all foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  however  all foreign currency exchange rates do not always move in such manner and actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
however  because short term investments mature relatively quickly and are required to be reinvested at the then current market rates  interest income on a portfolio consisting of short term investments is more subject to market fluctuations than a portfolio of longer term investments 
additionally  the contractual terms of the investments do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the investments at prices less than the stated par value 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 

table of contents as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale securities and  consequently  were recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  in stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  us treasury securities corporate bonds us agency securities commercial paper total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations
