we expect to continue investing in select development opportunities and in strategic acquisitions of mall properties that provide growth potential while disposing of non strategic assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of trustees and the company s independent registered public accounting firm 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the critical accounting policies discussed in this section reflect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy relating to minimum rents does not require the use of significant estimates 
minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the term of the related leases on a straight line basis 
percentage rents  tenant reimbursements  and components of other revenue include estimates 
percentage rents percentage rents  which are based on tenants sales as reported to the company  are recognized once the sales reported by such tenants exceed any applicable breakpoints as specified in the tenants leases 
the percentage rents are recognized based upon the measurement dates specified in the leases which indicate when the percentage rent is due 

table of contents tenant reimbursements estimates are used to record cost reimbursements from tenants for cam  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance 
we recognize revenue based upon the amounts to be reimbursed from our tenants for these items in the same period these reimbursable expenses are incurred 
differences between estimated cost reimbursements and final amounts billed are recognized in the subsequent year 
leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and variations exist in computations between properties and tenants 
the company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes  cam and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual reimbursements versus actual expenses 
adjustments are also made throughout the year to these receivables and the related cost reimbursement income based upon the company s best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected 
final billings to tenants for cam  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance in and  which were billed in and  respectively  did not vary significantly as compared to the estimated receivable balances 
if management s estimate of the percent of recoverable expenses that can be billed to the tenants in differs from actual amounts billed by  the amount of income recorded during would increase or decrease by approximately  outparcel sales the company may sell outparcels at its various properties 
the estimated cost used to calculate the margin from these sales involves a number of estimates 
the estimates made are based either upon assigning a proportionate value based upon historical cost paid for the total parcel to the portion of the parcel that is sold  or by incorporating the relative sales value method 
the proportionate share of actual cost is derived through consideration of numerous factors 
these factors include items such as ease of access to the parcel  visibility from high traffic areas  acreage of the parcel as well as other factors that may differentiate the desirability of the particular section of the parcel that is sold 
tenant accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the company s estimate of the amount of the recorded accounts receivable at the balance sheet date that will not be recovered from cash receipts in subsequent periods 
the company s policy is to record a periodic provision for doubtful accounts based on total revenues 
the company also periodically reviews specific tenant balances and determines whether an additional allowance is necessary 
in recording such a provision  the company considers a tenant s creditworthiness  ability to pay  probability of collections and consideration of the retail sector in which the tenant operates 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed and adjusted periodically based upon the company s historical experience 
investment in real estate carrying value of assets the company maintains a diverse portfolio of real estate assets 
the portfolio holdings have increased as a result of both acquisitions and the development of properties and have been reduced by selected sales of assets 
the amounts to be capitalized as a result of acquisition and developments and the periods over which the assets are depreciated or amortized are determined based on the application of accounting standards that may require estimates as to fair value and the allocation of various costs to the individual assets 
the company allocates the cost of the acquisition based upon the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company also estimates the fair value of intangibles related to its acquisitions 
the valuation of the fair value of the intangibles involves estimates related to market conditions  probability of lease renewals and the current market value of in place leases 
this market value is determined by considering factors such as the tenant s industry  location within the property and competition in the specific market in which the property operates 
differences in the amount attributed to the fair value estimate for intangible assets can be significant based upon the assumptions made in calculating these estimates 
impairment evaluation management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in real estate assets as required by asc topic property  plant and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of the investment in the asset is not reasonably assured 

table of contents the company evaluates the recoverability of its investments in real estate assets to be held and used each quarter and records an impairment charge when there is an indicator of impairment and the undiscounted projected cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the property are less than the carrying amount for a particular property 
the estimated cash flows used for the impairment analysis and the determination of estimated fair value are based on the company s plans for the respective assets and the company s views of market and economic conditions 
the company evaluates each property that has material reductions in occupancy levels and or net operating income performance and conducts a detailed evaluation of the properties 
the evaluations consider matters such as current and historical rental rates  occupancies for the respective properties and comparable properties as well as recent sales data for comparable properties in comparable markets 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in the company s plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of impairment losses  which  under the applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
investment in real estate held for sale the company evaluates the held for sale classification of its real estate each quarter 
assets that are classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
management evaluates the fair value less cost to sell each quarter and records impairment charges as required 
an asset is generally classified as held for sale once management commits to a plan to sell its entire interest in a particular property which results in no continuing involvement in the asset as well as initiates an active program to market the asset for sale 
in instances where the company may sell either a partial or entire interest in a property and has commenced marketing of the property  the company evaluates the facts and circumstances of the potential sale to determine the appropriate classification for the reporting period 
based upon management s evaluation  if it is expected that the sale will be for a partial interest  the asset is classified as held for investment 
if during the marketing process it is determined the asset will be sold in its entirety  the period of that determination is the period the asset would be reclassified as held for sale 
during the three months ended december   the company entered into a contract to sell a sixty nine acre parcel of vacant land located near cincinnati  ohio 
accordingly  we have classified this land as held for sale 
on occasion  the company will receive unsolicited offers from third parties to buy individual properties 
under these circumstances  the company will classify the particular property as held for sale when a sales contract is executed with no contingencies and the prospective buyer has funds at risk to ensure performance 
sale of real estate assets the company records sales of operating properties and outparcels using the full accrual method at closing when both of the following conditions are met a the profit is determinable  meaning that  the collectability of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  and b the earnings process is virtually complete  meaning that  the seller is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the profit 
sales not qualifying for full recognition at the time of sale are accounted for under other appropriate deferral methods 
accounting for acquisitions the fair value of the real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  acquired in place leases and the value of tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
purchase accounting is applied to assets and liabilities related to real estate entities acquired based upon the percentage of interest acquired 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land  building and tenant improvements is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
management determines the as if vacant fair value of an acquired property using methods to determine the replacement cost of the tangible assets 
in determining the fair value of the identified intangible assets and liabilities of an acquired property  above market and below market lease values are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between a the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and b management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values and the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an adjustment to rental income over the initial lease term 

table of contents the aggregate value of in place leases is determined by evaluating various factors  including an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods  current market conditions and similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses  and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease up periods based on current market demand 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related costs 
the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the remaining lease term plus an assumed renewal period that is reasonably assured 
the aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets include tenant relationships 
factors considered by management in assigning a value to these relationships include assumptions of the probability of lease renewals  investment in tenant improvements  leasing commissions and an approximate time lapse in rental income while a new tenant is located 
the value assigned to this intangible asset is amortized over the estimated life of the relationships 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense for real estate assets is computed using a straight line method and estimated useful lives for buildings and improvements using a weighted average composite life of forty years and three to ten years for equipment and fixtures 
expenditures for leasehold improvements and construction allowances paid to tenants are capitalized and amortized over the initial term of each lease 
cash allowances paid to tenants that are used for purposes other than improvements to the real estate are amortized as a reduction to minimum rents over the initial lease term 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
cash allowances paid in return for operating covenants from retailers who own their real estate are capitalized as contract intangibles 
these intangibles are amortized over the period the retailer is required to operate their store 
investment in and advances to unconsolidated real estate entities the company evaluates all joint venture arrangements for consolidation 
the percentage interest in the joint venture  evaluation of control and whether a variable interest entity vie exists are all considered in determining if the arrangement qualifies for consolidation 
we evaluate our investments in joint ventures to determine whether such entities may be a vie  and  if a vie  whether we are the primary beneficiary 
generally  an entity is determined to be a vie when either the equity investors if any lack one or more of the essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest  the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional subordinated financial support or the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportionate to their economic interests and the activities of the entity involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor with a disproportionately small voting interest 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that has both the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance including  but not limited to  the ability to direct financing  leasing  construction and other operating decisions and activities 
in addition  we consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions  to replace or remove the manager of the entity and to liquidate or sell the entity 
the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits when a reporting entity is affiliated with a vie must be based on ownership  contractual  and or other pecuniary interests in that vie 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary in one vie  and have consolidated it as disclosed in note investment in joint ventures consolidated 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated real estate entities using the equity method of accounting whereby the cost of an investment is adjusted for the company s share of equity in net income or loss beginning on the date of acquisition and reduced by distributions received 
the income or loss of each joint venture investor is allocated in accordance with the provisions of the applicable operating agreements 
the allocation provisions in these agreements may differ from the ownership interest held by each investor 
differences between the carrying amount of the company s investment in the respective joint venture and the company s share of the underlying equity of such unconsolidated entities are amortized over the respective lives of the underlying assets as applicable 
the company treats distributions from joint ventures as operating activities if they meet all three of the following conditions the amount represents the cash effect of transactions or events  the amounts result from a company s normal operations  and the amounts are derived from activities that enter into the determination of net income 
the company treats distributions from joint ventures as investing activities if they relate to the following activities lending money and collecting on loans  acquiring and selling or disposing of available for sale or held to maturity securities trading securities are classified based on the nature and purpose for which the securities were acquired  acquiring and selling or disposing of productive assets that are expected to generate revenue over a long period of time 

table of contents in the instance where the company receives a distribution made from a joint venture that has the characteristics of both an operating and investing activity  management identifies where the predominant source of cash was derived in order to determine its classification in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
when a distribution is made from operations  it is compared to the available retained earnings within the property 
cash distributed that does not exceed the retained earnings of the property is classified in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows as cash received from operating activities 
cash distributed in excess of the retained earnings of the property is classified in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows as cash received from an investing activity 
the company periodically reviews its investment in unconsolidated real estate entities for other than temporary declines in market value 
any decline that is not considered temporary will result in the recording of an impairment charge to the investment 
during the three months ended june   the company determined that it was more likely than not  that the joint venture that owns tulsa promenade tulsa would market the property for sale 
accordingly  the joint venture recorded a million impairment loss 
during the fourth quarter of  the joint venture that owns tulsa entered into a contingent contract to sell the property at a sale price lower than the reduced carrying value  and recorded an additional impairment loss of million  for a total impairment loss of million for the year ended december  the contract was terminated on february  during the contingency period 
the company s proportionate share of this impairment loss amounted to million for the year ended december  deferred costs the company capitalizes initial direct costs of leases and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term 
the costs are capitalized upon the execution of the lease and the amortization period begins the earlier of the store opening date or the date the tenant s lease obligation begins 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company manages economic risks  including interest rate  liquidity  and credit risk  primarily by managing the amount  sources  and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments 
specifically  the company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the payment of future uncertain cash amounts  the value of which are determined by interest rates 
the company s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount  timing  and duration of the company s known or expected cash payments principally related to the company s borrowings 
the company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements 
to accomplish these objectives  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy 
the company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities by following asc topic derivative and hedging 
the objective is to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under this guidance  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
it also requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about the fair value of gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative  whether the company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting 
derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  such as interest rate risk  are considered fair value hedges 
also  derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge 
the company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks  even though hedge accounting does not apply or the company elects not to apply hedge accounting under asc topic derivatives and hedging 

table of contents funds from operations our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we have indicated that ffo is a key measure of financial performance 
ffo is an important and widely used financial measure of operating performance in our industry  which we believe provides important information to investors and a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
we believe that ffo is an appropriate and valuable measure of our operating performance because real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains a residual value to a much greater extent than personal property and  accordingly  reductions for real estate depreciation and amortization charges are not meaningful in evaluating the operating results of the properties 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  as net income or loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  it also excludes impairment adjustments associated with depreciable real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company s ffo may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
the following table illustrates the calculation of ffo and the reconciliation of ffo to net loss to common shareholders for the years ended december    and in thousands for the years ended december  net loss to common shareholders add back less real estate depreciation and amortization pro rata share of consolidated joint venture depreciation equity in loss income of unconsolidated entities pro rata share of unconsolidated entities funds from operations noncontrolling interest in operating partnership gain on the disposition of real estate assets  net funds from operations amounts have changed from numbers previously reported due to the prior exclusion of of impairment losses 
ffo comparison of year ended december  to december  ffo decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received million less in operating income excluding real estate depreciation  gains on the sale of operating assets  adjustments for consolidated joint ventures and impairment losses 
this decrease was primarily driven by the conveyance of both lloyd center located in portland  oregon lloyd and westshore plaza located in tampa  florida westshore to a new entity and related sale of a interest in the entity to an affiliate of the blackstone group blackstone to form a new joint venture blackstone venture late in the first quarter of we also recorded during a million impairment charge associated with approximately sixty nine acres of undeveloped land located near cincinnati  ohio 
during the second quarter of  as part of our quarterly review to prepare our financial statements  we determined that it was more likely than not that the land would not be developed and accordingly reduced its carrying value to its estimated net realizable value 
lastly  we incurred million in additional preferred share dividends as a result of issuing an additional million shares of series g cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest series g preferred shares during april the april offering 

table of contents offsetting these decreases to ffo  we experienced million less in interest expense 
this decrease can be attributed to lower average borrowings during fiscal year as compared to our average loan balance decreased due to the conveyance of mortgage debt to the blackstone venture in march as well as reductions to outstanding borrowings on our corporate credit facility resulting from the application of net proceeds received from the april offering  a common stock offering completed in july the july offering  and common shares issued throughout  as well as proceeds generated from the conveyance of lloyd and westshore 
we also received million more in ffo from our investment in unconsolidated entities 
this increase can be attributed to positive contributions we received from our investment in the joint venture that owns pearlridge center pearlridge venture  a regional mall located in aiea  hawaii as well as full year contributions from the malls that comprise the blackstone venture 
ffo comparison of year ended december  to december  ffo decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received million less in operating income excluding real estate depreciation  gains on the sale of operating assets  adjustments for consolidated joint ventures and the write off of a note receivable 
this decrease was primarily a result of the conveyance of both lloyd and westshore to a new entity and the related sale of a interest in that entity to an affiliate of blackstone in connection with the formation the blackstone venture  late in the first quarter of we also incurred an additional million in preferred share dividends as a result of the april offering during the second quarter of finally  during the year ended december   we recorded a million gain on the embedded derivative liability associated with undeveloped land in vero beach  florida 
during the fourth quarter of as part of our normal quarterly review  the company determined that any future development of this land by the company was unlikely which resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the embedded derivative liability 
accordingly  we recorded this decrease in fair value and recorded a gain of million in connection with making this adjustment 
offsetting these decreases to ffo  we experienced an increase in our proportionate share of ffo from our unconsolidated entities of million 
this increase was primarily due to our joint venture investment share of the blackstone venture 
also  during  we incurred approximately million in impairment losses related to a non cash impairment loss attributed to the recorded carrying value of the undeveloped land in vero beach  florida referenced above 
we did not record any impairment losses during the year ended december  during however  we incurred a million charge to fully reserve against the note receivable we received as part of the consideration in connection with our million sale of university mall  located in tampa  florida  in july lastly  we incurred million less in interest expense 
this decrease can be attributed to the conveyance of lloyd and westshore to the blackstone venture and the decrease in the outstanding balance on our corporate credit facility resulting from the net proceeds generated from the preferred and common stock offerings completed during and offsetting these decreases to interest expense were higher borrowing costs resulting from the libor floor that was implemented when the credit facility was amended in march results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  of this amount  minimum rents increased  percentage rents increased million  tenant reimbursements decreased million  and other income increased million

we also experienced a million increase at jersey gardens related to expansions by certain tenants as well as new tenants opening their stores 
lastly  we experienced a  increase related to the acquisition of town center plaza town center located in leawood  kansas 
offsetting these increases  we experienced a decrease in minimum rents of million due to the conveyance of both lloyd and westshore to the blackstone venture which occurred in the first quarter of 
table of contents percentage rents percentage rents increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of increased sales productivity from certain tenants whose sales exceeded their respective breakpoints

offsetting this growth was a decrease of million in property operating expenses attributable to the conveyance of both lloyd and westshore to the blackstone venture 

table of contents real estate taxes real estate taxes increased  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  we experienced  in additional costs related to scottsdale quarter 
this increase can be primarily attributed to expensing real estate taxes that were previously capitalized as part of the development of this center 
also  northtown mall northtown experienced a  increase in taxes 
the increase at northtown can be attributed to a successful  multi year real estate tax appeal in which the benefits were recognized during the year ended december  offsetting this growth was a decrease of million as a result of the conveyance of both lloyd and westshore to the blackstone venture

average loan balance average rate total interest amortization of loan fees swap termination fees capitalized interest defeasance costs other interest expense the decrease in interest expense was due to decreases in the average loan balance  average rate and amortization of loan fees 
the average loan balance decreased due primarily to our use of proceeds from the company s common stock offering completed in january  along with proceeds from the at the market equity offering program instituted in may  to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our corporate credit facility 
the average rate has decreased due to the refinancing of mortgages and the removal of the libor floor in our corporate credit facility that was part of the modification completed in march amortization of loan fees decreased due to the scottsdale quarter loan fees being fully amortized in may and to the write off of loan fees associated with the payoff of the loan agreements for morgantown mall morgantown  northtown and polaris lifestyle center in connection with the modification as well as fees related to the corporate credit facility 
these cost savings were partially offset by a decrease in capitalized interest due to placing the completed phases of scottsdale quarter into service

table of contents developments one of our objectives is to enhance portfolio quality by developing new retail properties 
our management team has developed numerous retail properties nationwide and has significant experience in all phases of the development process including site selection  zoning  design  pre development leasing  construction financing  and construction management 
our development spending for the year ended december  primarily relates to our investment in scottsdale quarter 
the first two phases of scottsdale quarter are completed with approximately  square feet of gla consisting of approximately  square feet of retail space with approximately  square feet of office space above the retail units 
over of the retailers in the first two phases are now open and scottsdale quarter has become a dynamic  outdoor urban environment featuring sophisticated architectural design  comfortable pedestrian plazas  an open park space  and a variety of upscale shopping  dining and entertainment options 
scottsdale quarter s improvements have and will be funded primarily by the proceeds from the scottsdale loan discussed in our financing activities as well as additional equity contributions 
we are pleased with the tenant mix and overall leasing progress made to date on scottsdale quarter 
between signed leases and letters of intent  we have approximately of phase i and ii retail space addressed 
apple  armani exchange  brio  dominick s steakhouse  free people  gap  gap kids  grimaldi s pizzeria  h m  ipic theater  industrie denim  lululemon athletica  nike  pottery barn  republic of couture  sephora  stingray sushi  true food  and west elm have opened their stores 
also  more than of the office tenants have now moved in 
the first two phases of scottsdale quarter will require a net investment in hard costs of approximately million with a stabilized return ranging between approximately and 
the hard costs include land  construction and design costs  tenant improvements  third party leasing commissions  and ground lease payments 
in addition to the hard costs  we capitalize certain internal leasing costs  development fees  interest and real estate taxes 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in hard costs in the first two phases of the project 
scottsdale quarter was previously subject to a long term ground lease for property on which the project was constructed 
we previously owned a common interest in a joint venture that owned scottsdale quarter 
our former joint venture partner marketed the ground lease for sale  and we had the option to match the best offer 
in september  we purchased the fee interest in the land subject to the ground lease for million 
the purchase was partially funded by a million mortgage loan secured by the ground lease with the remaining funds coming from proceeds available under our prior facility 
as a result of the acquisition of the land subject to the ground lease  the expense associated with the ground lease is eliminated in consolidation 
we listed two parcels on the phase iii land with a broker 
the middle parcel of phase iii may be anchored by a luxury department store and the corner parcels will likely be residential with ground floor retail 
we also continue to work on a pipeline of other prospective development opportunities 
with the continued improvement in overall economic market conditions  management believes the possibility of moving forward with such development is increasing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
we use interest rate protection agreements or swap agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with long term  floating rate debt

the remainder of our debt at december  and december   bears interest at variable rates with weighted average interest rates of approximately and  respectively 
at december   the fair value of our debt excluding borrowings under our facilities was  million  compared to its carrying amount of  million 
fair value was estimated using cash flows discounted at current market rates  as estimated by management 
when determining current market rates for purposes of estimating the fair value of debt  we employed adjustments to the original credit spreads used when the debt was originally issued to account for current market conditions 
our combined future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  primarily libor 
based upon consolidated indebtedness and interest rates at december   a basis point increase in the market rates of interest would decrease both future earnings and cash flows by million per year 
also  the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately million 
a basis point decrease in the market rates of interest would increase future earnings and cash flows by million per year and increase the fair value of our debt by approximately million 
we have entered into certain swap agreements which impact this analysis at certain libor rate levels see note derivative financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements
