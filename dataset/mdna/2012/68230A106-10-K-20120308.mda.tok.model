table of contents overview of the company and developments we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients 
we have four product candidates in our pipeline  custirsen  ogx  ogx  and csp  each of which has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development 
of the product candidates in our pipeline  custirsen and ogx are clinical stage assets 
our product candidates custirsen  ogx  and ogx focus on mechanisms of treatment resistance in cancer patients and are designed to block the production of specific proteins that we believe promote survival of tumor cells and are over produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments 
our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cell s adaptive defenses  thereby rendering the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies 
we believe this approach will increase survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients 
product candidate csp is the lead compound from a family of caspase activators that have been in licensed from bayer and demonstrate activation of programmed cell death in pre clinical models 
product candidate custirsen as discussed above  in december  we announced our entry into the collaboration agreement with teva for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds targeting clusterin  excluding ogx and ogx 
we and teva have developed an amended clinical development plan under which the following three phase clinical trials have been or are expected to be initiated the ongoing phase clinical trial  referred to as the synergy trial  or synergy  to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first line docetaxel treatment in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer  or crpc 
during discussions with the fda  the fda has stated to us that an application supported primarily by the results of synergy alone would be acceptable for submission for market approval 
the companies updated the enrollment target for synergy from patients to patients which is expected to enhance the potential for synergy to be reviewed by the regulatory agencies independent of additional phase studies 
along with the increased number of patients  the hazard ratio has been revised from 
to 
our expected timing of results for the survival primary endpoint that is based on a pre specified number of death events is currently projected to be the fourth quarter of  and we currently expect to complete patient accrual in the second half of a phase clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel treatment as second line chemotherapy in patients with crpc 
we expect to enroll approximately patients in this trial 
together with teva  we plan to initiate this phase clinical trial in the second half of the phase study is designed to show a survival benefit with power based on a hazard ratio of  or an approximate increase in survival time  when custirsen is combined with cabazitaxel for second line chemotherapy 
this trial will be conducted in lieu of the phase clinical trial  referred to as saturn  which was designed to evaluate a durable pain palliation benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel or docetaxel as second line chemotherapy in patients with crpc 
the company plans to begin closing down the saturn trial in the first quarter of a phase clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first line chemotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we continue to work with teva to finalize our development plans for custirsen in non small cell lung cancer 
as previously stated  we expect to initiate this program in the second half of for detailed information regarding our relationship with teva and the collaboration agreement  refer to the discussion under the heading business license and collaboration agreements teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
custirsen received fast track designations from the fda for the treatment of progressive metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel 
the fda has also agreed on the design of the synergy trial via the spa process 

table of contents we have also received written  scientific advice from the ema on our development plan for custirsen for treating patients with crpc in combination with docetaxel  which advice corresponded with our development plan regarding the proposed pre clinical studies and both the study design and analyses for the phase synergy trial 
in addition  the chmp agreed that the intended safety database would enable a sufficient qualified risk benefit assessment for market approval 
our phase registration trials have been designed based on our phase clinical results  including a randomized phase trial evaluating the benefit of combining custirsen with first line docetaxel  the final results of which were published in the september  issue of the jco 
analyses indicating a survival benefit in patients treated with custirsen in combination with first line docetaxel compared to docetaxel alone  the latter being the current standard of care for patients with advanced  progressive metastatic prostate cancer requiring initial chemotherapy  are described under the heading business our product candidates custirsen summary of results of custirsen phase clinical trials due to the results of the phase trial  the synergy trial will evaluate the survival benefit of custirsen in patients treated with first line chemotherapy 
a phase trial evaluating patients with metastatic crpc who progressed while receiving  or within six months of completing  first line docetaxel treatment 
as of august   the estimated median over survival duration for the custirsen plus mitoxantrone arm was months for the custirsen plus docetaxel re treatment arm  the median overall survival was estimated at months for the randomized patients and months for the combined patients which included additional patients with high serum clusterin levels at enrollment beyond the randomized patients 
of the patients on this trial who had pain or were on opioids for pain control and were retreated with docetaxel as second line treatment in combination with custirsen  approximately had durable pain palliation 
this is favorable even when compared to the pain responses of three weeks or greater observed in the phase trial  which supported the registration of docetaxel as first line chemotherapy in patients with crpc  and when compared to the pain responses for cabazitaxel of and for mitoxantrone of observed in the phase tropic trial 
due to the results of our phase trial  in the second half of we plan to initiate a phase trial evaluating the survival benefit of custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel as second line chemotherapy 
we expect this trial to enroll patients who have previously received first line docetaxel therapy 
a phase trial evaluating patients with advanced nsclc who received custirsen in combination with gemcitabine and a platinum chemotherapy cisplatin or carboplatin as first line chemotherapy 
the median overall survival was months and of patients survived at least one year 
thirty percent of patients who received custirsen with first line chemotherapy survived at least two years 
for comparison  published studies using a platinum based regimen plus gemcitabine as first line chemotherapy for advanced nsclc reported median survivals of to months and one year survival rates of to 
market approval for roche s avastin plus paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy for nsclc was based on results showing a median survival of months compared to months for patients treated with chemotherapy alone 
survival rates for avastin plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone were reported as versus at one year and versus at two years  respectively 
product candidate ogx ogx is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of heat shock protein  or hsp  a cell survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including prostate  bladder  breast and non small cell lung cancer 
hsp expression is stress induced  including by many anti cancer therapies 
for example  hsp levels increased four fold in prostate cancer patients after treatment with chemotherapy or hormone therapy 
overexpression of hsp is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis  negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types 

table of contents our current ogx development activities include the following clinical trials that have been or are expected to be initiated is as follows the ongoing phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with metastatic bladder cancer 
the trial is currently enrolling up to patients 
the trial design is a three arm  randomized phase in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in the first line metastatic setting 
under the trial  each arm is currently enrolling approximately patients and the trial will be initiated in sites throughout the united states  canada and europe 
the trial will be conducted as an event driven trial such that the final analysis will have power to show a critical hazard ratio of approximately to 
this type of phase trial will allow us to better predict the potential size of and success for a phase trial where a survival benefit will be the primary endpoint 
we currently expect to complete patient accrual in the second half of an ongoing investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered with prednisone to patients with crpc 
this randomized  controlled phase trial is currently enrolling up to patients who have minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who have not yet received chemotherapy 
the trial is designed to determine the potential benefit of ogx by assessing the number of patients without disease progression at weeks post study treatment with or without ogx this trial will also measure the direct effect of ogx on psa levels  time to progression by psa or measurable disease  numbers of ctcs  and other relevant secondary endpoints 
we currently expect to complete patient accrual in the second half of preliminary data have been presented 
we intend to initiate a randomized  controlled phase study evaluating ogx in combination with abiraterone acetate for the treatment of crpc  in the second half of this trial will be supported in part by investigator grant funding 
an ongoing investigator sponsored phase clinical trial to evaluate ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with bladder cancer 
the trial is currently enrolling up to patients  it is designed to determine the safety and potential benefit of ogx administered into the bladder using a catheter  which is known as intravesical instillation 
in addition  the trial will measure the direct effect of ogx on expression of hsp in bladder tumor cells  as well as determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ogx when delivered by intravesical instillation 
this clinical trial is being funded by the national cancer institute of canada 
we expect to complete patient accrual in the second half of preliminary data have been presented 
available preliminary data from our ongoing phase and phase clinical trials as well as a completed phase trial is as follows preliminary study results in our ongoing investigator sponsored randomized phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered as a monotherapy to patients with crpc were presented at asco gu in february the preliminary data showed a higher number of patients without disease progression at weeks  and greater declines in prostate specific antigen psa and circulating tumor cells ctc with ogx plus prednisone treatment compared to prednisone alone 
preliminary study results in our ongoing investigator sponsored phase clinical trial  evaluating ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with superficial or muscle invasive bladder cancer  showed preliminary results that demonstrated a trend towards decreased levels of hsp and increased tumor cell death rates after intravesical treatment with ogx additionally  of the patients treated with ogx  had complete responses with no pathologic evidence of disease observed in post surgical tissue after the four intravesical ogx treatments 
the lack of disease post ogx intravesical treatment prevented the ability to evaluate the hsp levels within tumor cells and the tumor cell death rates in these patients 
preliminary data from this trial was presented at the asco genitourinary cancers symposium in february ogx has been evaluated in a phase trial in patients with bladder  breast  prostate  ovarian  or nsclc who have failed potentially curative treatments or for which a curative treatment does not exist 
final results of this phase trial were presented during an oral presentation at the asco annual meeting 
the phase trial evaluated patients treated with ogx as a single agent and patients with ogx 
table of contents in combination with docetaxel who had failed up to six prior chemotherapy treatments 
ogx as a single agent administered weekly was evaluated at doses from mg up to mg in five cohorts of approximately six patients in each cohort 
two further cohorts tested ogx at the and mg doses combined with docetaxel 
patients could receive up to ten day cycles 
ogx was well tolerated both as a monotherapy and in combination with docetaxel 
most adverse events were mild grade or and mainly occurred during the three loading doses given over nine days prior to weekly dosing 
the most frequently reported adverse events in the ogx monotherapy arms were infusion related reactions and chills 
the most frequently reported adverse events in the ogx plus docetaxel arms were infusion related reactions  chills  fatigue  diarrhea  pruritus  nausea  and back pain 
despite evaluating ogx at very high doses  a maximum tolerated dose for ogx was not reached in this trial 
of patients with prostate cancer had at least one post baseline psa a prostate tumor marker 
three of in the monotherapy cohorts had reductions in psa greater than or equal to as did of in the combination therapy cohorts 
six of seven patients with ovarian cancer had both baseline and post baseline ca measurements 
all were treated with monotherapy 
three patients had a reduction of ca of particular interest was the decrease at all doses and in all diseases evaluated in the trial for both total ctcs and ctcs which were positive for hsp  hsp ctcs 
recent studies have shown that the presence of ctcs in peripheral blood may be of prognostic significance for patients with solid tumors and patients with values of five ctcs or fewer are generally considered to have a more favorable prognosis 
product candidates ogx and csp ogx  an inhibitor of insulin growth factor binding proteins and  and csp  a caspase activator  are in pre clinical development 
we are currently evaluating various alternatives  including partnering  which would allow us to further the development of these pre clinical assets 
collaboration revenue we recorded million of collaboration revenue in connection with our collaboration agreement with teva in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  at december   an aggregate of million of the upfront collaboration payment was included in the balance sheet line items current deferred collaboration revenue  which we are recognizing as we incur direct and indirect development costs under the collaboration agreement 
as the direct and indirect costs associated with the clinical development plan are incurred and the associated revenue is recognized  the current deferred collaboration revenue balance is reduced 
management currently expects that all remaining current deferred collaboration revenue will be recognized as collaboration revenue by the fourth quarter of further  we are eligible to receive payments of up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones set forth in the collaboration agreement 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments  although we do not expect to receive any milestone payments from teva in the year ending december  moreover  isis has disclosed in its securities and exchange commission  or sec  filings that it is entitled to receive of the up to million in milestone payments we may receive from teva as part of the collaboration agreement 
we disagree with their assessment but believe there may be some lesser payment obligation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further details on our collaboration with teva 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of costs for milestone payments to third parties  clinical trials  materials and supplies  facilities  personnel  including salaries and benefits  regulatory activities  pre clinical studies  and allocations of other r d related costs 
external r d expenses include fees paid to universities  hospitals and other entities that conduct certain r d activities and that manufacture our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
currently  we manage our clinical trials through independent medical investigators at their sites and at hospitals and expect this practice to continue 
under the collaboration agreement with teva  we are required to spend million towards development of custirsen  which will include our personnel costs for certain development activities 
teva will fund all other expenses incurred pursuant to the clinical development plan 
costs that we incurred totaling million of in 
table of contents  million in  and million in have been applied against our million funding commitment  resulting in a remaining funding commitment of million at december  we expect aggregate full time equivalent reimbursement of between and million annually from to  which will be applied against our funding commitment  or reimbursed to us from teva on a cash basis 
we currently expect that we will incur all remaining costs associated with the clinical development plan by the fourth quarter of a majority of our expenditures to date have been related to the development of custirsen 
until july   custirsen was being co developed with isis and r d expenses for custirsen were shared by us and by isis 
on july   we and isis amended the agreement to provide for unilateral development of custirsen by us 
in connection with the collaboration agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between us and isis relating to custirsen  we paid million to isis in the first quarter of  which was included in r d expenses in we also paid  to ubc in the first quarter of pursuant to the terms of the license agreement relating to custirsen  which was also included in r d expenses in several of our clinical trials have been supported by grant funding that was received directly by the hospitals and or clinical investigators conducting the clinical trials  thereby allowing us to complete these clinical trials at a lower cost to us 
since our drug candidates are in the early stages of development  we cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our r d projects  if ever 
our projects or intended r d activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our r d priorities and available resources 
we expect our r d expenses to increase in and into the future  likely significantly  as we further expand development of custirsen  ogx and our other programs 
our programs or anticipated programs may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our r d priorities and available resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in executive  business development  human resources  external communications  finance and other administrative functions  as well as consulting costs  including market research and business consulting  and intellectual property 
other costs include professional fees for legal and auditing services  insurance and facility costs 
we believe that g a resources are sufficient to carry on existing development activities 
we anticipate that g a expenses will increase in the future as we continue to expand our operating activities 
restructuring activities on august   sonus completed a transaction  or the arrangement  with oncogenex technologies whereby sonus acquired all of the outstanding preferred shares  common shares and convertible debentures of oncogenex technologies 
sonus then changed its name to oncogenex pharmaceuticals  inc prior to the arrangement  sonus entered into a non cancellable lease arrangement for office space located in bothell  washington  the square footage of which exceeds our current requirements 
we are currently in the process of evaluating opportunities to exit or sublet portions of the leased space 
we recorded an initial restructuring charge of million on august  as part of the purchase price allocation 
the liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining lease payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with the then effective eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
this represents our best estimate of the liability 
subsequent changes in the liability due to accretion  or changes in estimates of sublease assumptions are recognized as adjustments to restructuring charges in future periods 
in june  we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the excess lease facility liability 
these assumptions were subsequently revised again in december and september these changes in estimate resulted in increases in the value of the excess lease liability of million  million  and million in 
table of contents expense recorded in june  december  and september  respectively  to reflect these changes in estimate 
in the year ended december   with respect to excess facilities  million was amortized into income through research and development expense  resulting in a remaining liability of million at december  results of operations years ended december  and december  revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in as compared to was due to lower reimbursement revenue earned through our strategic collaboration with teva resulting from manufacturing costs now being paid directly by teva and lower clinical trial costs associated with the saturn trial 
revenue for includes recognition of million from the million upfront payment  as well as million earned through collaborative research  which has been reimbursed to us on a cash basis 
at december   million of the upfront payment received from teva in december was included on our consolidated balance sheet as deferred collaboration revenue  which we are recognizing as we perform our financial obligation under the collaboration agreement 
management currently expects this performance obligation will be completed in the fourth quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form k for further details on our collaboration with teva 
costs for clinical development programs include external direct expenses such as patient treatment costs  clinical trial site costs  clinical research organization costs and contract manufacturing fees incurred for pre clinical  clinical  manufacturing and regulatory activities associated with preparing the compounds for submissions of ndas or similar regulatory filings to the fda  ema or other regulatory agencies outside the united states and europe 
other research and development includes indirect operating costs such as our personnel and occupancy expenses associated with our clinical development programs and other research and development costs associated with the development of our other product candidates 
our internal resources  employees  and infrastructure are not directly tied to any individual research project and are typically deployed across multiple projects 
through our clinical development programs  we are developing each of our product candidates in parallel for multiple disease indications 
due to the number of ongoing projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  we do not record or maintain information regarding the indirect operating costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
in addition  we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project 
the majority of our costs incurred prior to were related to the development of custirsen 
our research and development expenses for our clinical development programs are as follows in thousands september  september  september  twelve months ended december  clinical development programs custirsen ogx other research and development total research and development expenses r d expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december  the increase in as compared to was due primarily to higher ogx clinical trial and manufacturing costs  higher employee expenses  including stock based compensation  offset by lower 
table of contents custirsen manufacturing costs  as these costs are now being paid directly by teva 
certain costs for the custirsen phase clinical trials are applied against the non refundable upfront payments received from teva in december  while costs unassociated with the phase trials in second line crpc  such as manufacturing costs and compensation for work performed by our employees on the synergy trial  are reimbursable from teva on a cash basis 
we expect r d expenses to increase as we further develop our product candidates 
the increase in r d expense in as compared to was due primarily to higher ogx clinical trial and manufacturing costs  higher employee expenses  including stock based compensation  offset by lower milestone payments owed to isis and ubc resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva 
g a expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in was due primarily to higher employee expenses  including stock based compensation expenses  partially offset by lower audit and accounting fees 
restructuring expense for the year ended december  was nil  as compared with million in in september  we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the value of the excess lease facility liability 
this change in estimate resulted in an increase in the value of our excess lease liability and a million restructuring expense recorded in september to reflect this change in estimate 
there was no comparable charge in we recorded a million gain on revaluation of the warrants at december  which is included on our consolidated statement of loss as gain on warrants

an income tax recovery of million was recorded in the second quarter of  as we received approval from the israeli tax authority  or ita  for its request for a withholdings tax exemption on amounts received from teva in relation to the collaboration 
under the collaboration agreement  teva paid us million in upfront payments  of which million was for an upfront milestone payment and subject to possible withholding taxes by the ita 
prior to the receipt of the approval  teva was granted a temporary exemption for a transfer of million of the million upfront milestone payment 
this temporary exemption was conditioned upon teva s depositing million  which represented of the upfront milestone payment paid according to the collaboration agreement  in a trust account in favor of the ita until a final decision would be made by the ita regarding the request 
accordingly  prior to the receipt of the approval  we had recorded a million liability recognizing this amount as an uncertain tax position 
following this approval from the ita  this liability was released  and we recorded a million income tax recovery

we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate product sales revenue for several years  if ever 
in the year ended december   we generated million in collaboration revenue from the collaboration agreement with teva 

table of contents all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our equity securities  and upfront payments received from teva 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased to million in the aggregate from million as of december  as of december   we do not have any borrowing or credit facilities 
based on our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations our currently planned operations are set forth below under the heading operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows cash used in operations for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities decreased to million  from in cash used in operations activities in the decrease in cash used in operations is primarily attributable to payments made to isis and ubc in the first quarter of resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva and lower custirsen manufacturing costs  as these costs are now being paid directly by teva  partially offset by higher ogx clinical and manufacturing costs in for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities of million was attributable primarily to the upfront cash payment from teva  offset by increased r d expenses associated with personnel and facilities assumed in the arrangement  cash used to reduce liabilities assumed in the arrangement and increased current assets associated with r d activities 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million from million 
all net cash provided by financing activities in the twelve months ended december  was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common shares on stock option exercises and all net cash provided by financing activities in the twelve months ended december  was the result of proceeds from the issuance of common shares pursuant to the financing we completed in october and stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was million  resulting from net proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares through a registered direct offering  net proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares to teva as part of a stock purchase agreement  and the proceeds from the issuance of common shares on stock option exercises 
cash used provided by investing activities net cash provided in investing activities for the year ended december  increased to million from million in cash used by investing activities in the year ended december  net cash used in or provided by investing activities in the years ended december  and december  were due to transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  was million  resulting from the transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including for working capital purposes  capital expenditures  and various contractual obligations for at least the next months 
we also believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and receivables from teva will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into including 
table of contents completing the synergy trial  a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel as first line chemotherapy in approximately  patients with crpc  initiating and enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel as second line chemotherapy  which is expected to be initiated in  initiating and enrolling patients in a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in patients with advanced  unresectable nsclc  which is expected to be initiated in  completing an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in combination with prednisone in patients with prostate cancer who have not received chemotherapy  completing an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with superficial or muscle invasive bladder cancer  which was initiated in august  and completing enrollment in a phase clinical trial evaluating ogx in combination with standard first line chemotherapy in approximately patients with metastatic bladder cancer  and initiating and enrolling a phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in combination with abiraterone acetate in patients with prostate cancer 
as of december   we have a remaining commitment to fund million towards the three phase trials of custirsen  while teva is required to fund all additional expenses under the clinical development plan 
the final results from the phase trials may be released at a date that is beyond the period for which we currently project we have available cash resources 
in addition  if we desire to conduct development activities with respect to our other product candidates beyond those development activities mentioned in the list above  we will require additional funding to support such operations 
if we need to extend our cash availability  or to conduct any such currently unplanned development activities  we would seek such necessary funding through the licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  by executing a partnership or collaboration agreement  or through private or public offerings of our equity or debt 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including timing  costs and results of clinical trials  pre clinical development and regulatory approvals  success of custirsen and achieving milestones and royalties  maintaining our relationship with teva and teva s ongoing level of focus and efforts to develop custirsen  timing  costs and results of drug discovery and r d  entering into new collaborative or product license agreements for products in our pipeline  our ability to obtain additional funding through a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party or licenses of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity or debt  and costs related to obtaining  defending and enforcing patents

contingencies and commitments teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
in december  oncogenex pharmaceuticals  inc  through its wholly owned subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  entered into a collaboration agreement with teva for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds 
under the collaboration agreement  teva made upfront payments in the aggregate amount of million  and may make additional payments up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones and royalties at percentage rates ranging from the mid teens to mid twenties on net sales 
teva also acquired million of our common stock at a premium under a separate stock purchase agreement 
we are required to contribute million in direct and indirect costs towards the clinical development plan 
as of december   million of these costs have been incurred by oncogenex  resulting in a remaining funding responsibility of million which has been recorded under current deferred collaboration revenue 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
pursuant to the collaboration agreement  we agreed to collaborate with teva in the development and global commercialization of custirsen 
teva received the exclusive worldwide right and license to develop and commercialize products containing custirsen and related compounds the licensed products 
we have an option to co promote custirsen in the united states and canada 

table of contents in addition to the development costs noted above  teva is also responsible for all costs relating to product commercialization including costs incurred in relation to our co promotion option  except for start up costs in advance of commercialization 
isis pharmaceuticals inc and university of british columbia pursuant to license agreements we have with the ubc and isis  we are obligated to pay milestone payments of up to cad million and million  respectively  upon the achievement of specified product development milestones related to ogx and ogx and low to mid single digit royalties on future product sales 
in addition  we are required to pay to isis of all non royalty revenue defined to mean revenue not based on net sales of products we receive 
isis has disclosed in its sec filings that it is entitled to receive of the up to million in milestone payments we may receive from teva as part of the collaboration agreement  however  we believe that certain of the milestone payments related to sales targets may qualify as royalty revenue defined to mean revenue based on net sales of products  and therefore be subject to the lesser payment obligations 
no assurance can be provided that we will be entitled to receive these milestone payments or  if we are  that the applicable amount payable to isis will be less than 
we are also obligated to pay to ubc certain patent costs and annual license maintenance fees for the extent of the patent life of cad  per year 
we paid isis and ubc usd  and cad  respectively  in upon the initiation of a phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with crpc 
we do not anticipate making any royalty payments to isis in the ubc agreements have effective dates ranging from november  to april  and each agreement expires upon the later of years from its effective date or the expiry of the last patent licensed thereunder  unless otherwise terminated 
unless otherwise terminated  the isis agreements for custirsen and ogx will continue for each product until the later of years after the date of the first commercial product sale  or the expiration of the last to expire of any patents required to be licensed in order to use or sell the product  unless oncogenex technologies abandons either custirsen or ogx and isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development 
the isis agreement for ogx will continue into perpetuity unless oncogenex technologies abandons the product and isis does not elect to unilaterally continue development 
to facilitate the execution and performance of the collaboration agreement with teva  oncogenex and isis agreed to amend the isis license agreement and oncogenex and ubc agreed to make a corresponding amendment to the ubc license agreement  in each case  effective december and december   respectively 
the amendment to the isis license agreement provides  among other things  that if we are subject to change of control with a third party  where the surviving company immediately following such change of control has the right to develop and sell the product  then i a milestone payment of million will be due and payable to isis days following the first commercial sale of the product in the united states  and ii unless such surviving entity had previously sublicensed the product and a royalty rate payable to isis by the company has been established  the applicable royalty rate payable to isis will thereafter be the maximum amount payable under the isis license agreement 
any non royalty milestone amounts previously paid will be credited toward the million milestone if not already paid 
as a result of the million milestone payment payable to isis in relation to the collaboration agreement  the remaining amount owing in the event of change of control discussed above is a maximum of million 
because we have now licensed the product to teva and established a royalty rate payable to isis  no royalty rate adjustments would apply if teva were to acquire us and becomes the surviving company 
if the million in advanced reimbursement of development activities has not been spent by oncogenex prior to the third anniversary of the collaboration agreement between oncogenex and teva  oncogenex will pay isis an amount equal to of any un spent portion less million

table of contents clinical research organizations our clinical research organization  or cro  contracts typically call for specified prepaid amounts to be maintained and held in escrow for future services to be rendered by the cro 
an amount of  was paid in january for future services to be performed for the phase trial of ogx in patients with metastatic bladder cancer 
guarantees and indemnifications we indemnify our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is equal to the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited  however  we have obtained director and officer insurance that limits our exposure and may enable us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
we believe that the fair value of these indemnification obligations is minimal 
accordingly  we have not recognized any liabilities relating to these obligations as of december  we have certain agreements with certain organizations with which we do business that contain indemnification provisions pursuant to which we typically agree to indemnify the party against certain types of third party claims 
we accrue for known indemnification issues when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
there were no accruals for or expenses related to indemnification issues for any period presented 
material changes in financial condition september  september  in thousands december  december  total assets total liabilities total equity the decrease in assets from december  to december  primarily relates to costs incurred in relation to development of ogx and the custirsen clinical development plan 
the decrease in liabilities from december  relates predominantly to the revaluation of the warrant liability  amortization of restructuring related liabilities  and the recognition of deferred collaboration revenue 
the decrease in equity relates primarily to the net loss attributable to common shareholders incurred in critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions principally relate to the period we expect to recognize our remaining current deferred collaboration revenue under our collaboration and license agreement  or collaboration agreement  with teva  estimates of the initial fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants  the resolution of uncertain tax positions and estimates of the fair value of our excess lease facility liability 
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  which we consider as available for sale and are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of shareholders equity deficiency 

table of contents short term investments short term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than one year 
we consider our short term investments as available for sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses except other than temporary losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of shareholders equity deficiency 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss 
the cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities 
the company determines the fair value of its warrant liability based on the black scholes pricing model and using considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
other financial instruments including amounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  are carried at cost  which we believe approximates fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments 
intellectual property the costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development process  including licensing fees and milestone payments  are charged to research and development expense as incurred in situations where we have not identified an alternative future use for the acquired rights  and are capitalized in situations where it has identified an alternative future use 
no costs associated with acquiring intellectual property rights have been capitalized to date 
costs of maintaining intellectual property rights are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the upfront payment we received in the fourth quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement with teva  as well as cash reimbursements from teva for certain costs incurred by us under the clinical development plan we and teva developed under which three phase clinical trials will be initiated 
under the collaboration agreement  we and teva share certain custirsen related development costs 
we are required to spend million in direct and indirect development costs  such as full time equivalent fte reimbursement for time incurred by our personnel for the benefit of the custirsen development plan  such contribution to be funded by the upfront payment provided by teva as an advanced reimbursement for the company development expenses  or reimbursed to oncogenex on a cash basis 
teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
when we have fulfilled its requirement to spend million in direct and indirect development costs  including ftes  teva will  on a quarterly basis  reimburse all development expenses incurred in accordance with the clinical development plan 
our policy is to account for these reimbursements as collaboration revenue 
for a summary description of the collaboration agreement  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the collaboration agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables  and requires evaluation pursuant to asc  multiple element arrangements  or asc we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreement to determine whether it had obligations constituting deliverables under asc we concluded that it had multiple deliverables under the collaboration agreement  including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services in the us and canada  and estimated that the period in which we would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the fourth quarter of because we were able to establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the maintenance  regulatory  and clinical services  we concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as separate units of accounting under asc in establishing vsoe for the manufacturing  regulatory  and clinical development services  management relied on rates charged by other service providers providing similar development services 

table of contents we will recognize million allocated to the manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services element as revenue on a proportional performance basis  as we incur direct and indirect development costs under the collaboration agreement 
as the direct and indirect costs associated with the clinical development plan are incurred and the associated revenue is recognized  the current deferred collaboration revenue balance is reduced 
management currently expects that all remaining current deferred collaboration revenue will be in recognized as collaboration revenue by the fourth quarter of estimation of the period we expect to incur direct and indirect costs associated with the clinical development plan requires the use of management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the direct and indirect development costs include  but are not limited to its experience  along with teva s experience  in conducting clinical development activities 
we will review the projected direct and indirect development costs associated with the clinical development plan on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
future changes in estimates of the total direct and indirect development costs may materially impact the timing of the future revenue recognized under the collaboration agreement 
direct and indirect development costs consists primarily of time recognized as hours incurred  multiplied by contractual billing rates  materials and other related costs 
because management is not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license  it used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize 
based on this approach  we recognized million in relating to this element 
under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  and that achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us 
management concluded that each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments  and that the milestone payments  once received  relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
under the collaboration agreement  we are also entitled to receive percentage royalties on sales of custirsen ranging from the mid teens to the mid twenties 
we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenue  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 
property and equipment property and equipment assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation expense on assets acquired under capital lease is recorded within depreciation expense 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the following periods september  computer equipment years furniture and fixtures years leasehold improvements and equipment under capital lease over the term of the lease income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases and for operating losses and tax credit carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for the portion of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be unrealized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws 

table of contents scientific research and development tax credits the benefits of tax credits for scientific research and development expenditures are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is made provided there is reasonable assurance of recoverability 
the tax credits recorded are based on management s estimates of amounts expected to be recovered and are subject to audit by taxation authorities 
the non refundable tax credit reduces the tax provision  however  no reduction to the tax provision has been recorded to date as we record a full valuation allowance 
all qualifying expenditures are eligible for non refundable tax credits only 
therapeutic discovery research grants the internal revenue service s therapeutic discovery tax credit program  created under the patient protection and affordable care act of  provides tax credits or grants representing up to percent of eligible qualified investments in therapeutic discovery projects during tax years and we applied for and received funds under this program to support the company s custirsen  and ogx development projects 
the benefits of research grants under the internal revenue service s therapeutic discovery tax credit program are recognized in the year the qualifying expenditure is approved provided there is reasonable assurance of recoverability 
the tax grants recorded are based on management s estimates of amounts expected to be received and are subject to audit by taxation authorities 
the research grants reduce the carrying cost of expenditures for research and development expenses to which it relates 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred  net of related refundable investment tax credits  with the exception of non refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development  which are capitalized in accordance with asc  research and development and included within prepaid expenses 
clinical trial expenses are a component of research and development costs 
these expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations and investigators and other service providers  which conduct certain product development activities on our behalf 
we use an accrual basis of accounting  based upon estimates of the amount of service completed 
in the event payments differ from the amount of service completed  prepaid expense or accrued liabilities amounts are adjusted on the balance sheet 
these expenses are based on estimates of the work performed under service agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and experience with similar contracts 
we monitor each of these factors to the extent possible and adjusts estimates accordingly 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the asc  stock compensation  using the modified prospective method with respect to options granted to employees and directors 
under this transition method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date for all share based payments granted after january  and for all awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of january  the expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the graded vesting period 
segment information we follow the requirements of asc  segment reporting 
we have one operating segment  dedicated to the development and commercialization of new cancer therapies  with operations located in canada and the united states 
comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss 
other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale marketable securities 
we have reported the components of comprehensive loss in the statement of shareholders equity 

table of contents loss per common share basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted loss per common share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock method 
the effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding stock options is anti dilutive for all periods presented 
warrants we account for warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and therefore do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
the computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the warrants 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on revaluation of warrants 
reclassifications certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the expenses associated with adjustments to sublease income assumptions relating to our bothell facility please see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k were reclassified during the third quarter of from research and development expenses to restructuring expenses 
this reclassification on the statements of loss was made in all prior periods presented for comparability purposes 
this reclassification had no effect on net loss attributable to common shareholders  shareholders equity  total assets and total liabilities  or the major categories of the cash flow statement 
recently adopted accounting policies in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu no 
revenue recognition milestone method topic milestone method of revenue recognition 
this standard provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for certain research and development transactions 
under this new standard  a company can recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved as long as the milestone is considered substantive according to the criteria set forth in this new standard 
the company adopted this standard on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter ended march  the adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures 
the new guidance requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements  amends disclosures about post retirement benefit plan assets  and provides clarification regarding the level of disaggregation of fair value disclosures by investment class 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain level activity disclosure requirements that are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  accordingly  we adopted this amendment in the quarter ended march   while the additional level requirements were adopted in the quarter ended march  the adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income 
this asu defers the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu no 
the amendments are being made to allow the board time to redeliberate whether to present on 
table of contents the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
while the board is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before update all other requirements in update are not affected by this update  including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
public entities are required to apply these requirements for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  nonpublic entities should begin applying these requirements for fiscal years ending after december   and interim and annual periods thereafter 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this new asu 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income 
this asu intends to enhance comparability and transparency of other comprehensive income components 
the guidance provides an option to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in a single continuous statement or two separate but consecutive statements 
this asu eliminates the option to present other comprehensive income components as part of the statement of changes in shareowners equity 
the provisions of this asu will be applied retrospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  early application is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this new asu 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurement 
this asu clarifies the concepts related to highest and best use and valuation premise  blockage factors and other premiums and discounts  the fair value measurement of financial instruments held in a portfolio and of those instruments classified as a component of shareowners equity 
the guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about recurring level fair value measurements  the use of nonfinancial assets  and the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value 
the provisions of this asu are effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  early application is prohibited 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this new asu 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values and future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of the changes in market interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars  and we monitor our exposure to interest rate changes is monitored 
we have very limited interest rate risk due to the few assets or liabilities subject to fluctuations in interests rates 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
due to the nature of our highly liquid marketable securities  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value 
we have estimated the effect on our portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of  in the fair value of our investments as of december  foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on certain contracts and payroll expenses related to our canadian subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  denominated in canadian dollars and we have not hedged these amounts 
as our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuate  our earnings might be negatively affected 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period 
we have estimated the effect on our reported results of operations of a hypothetical increase of percent in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the us dollar to be  for the year ended december
