item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
dollar amounts are in thousands except for per share amounts and where otherwise noted 

table of contents business and operational overview fastenal is a north american leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies 
we distribute these supplies through a network of approximately  company owned stores 
most of our customers are in the manufacturing and non residential construction markets 
the manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers oem and maintenance and repair operations mro 
the non residential construction market includes general  electrical  plumbing  sheet metal  and road contractors 
other users of our product include farmers  truckers  railroads  mining companies  federal  state  and local governmental entities  schools  and certain retail trades 
geographically  our stores and customers are primarily located in north america 
like most industrial and construction centric organizations  we have endured a roller coaster ride over the last several years 
the third quarter of included the final months of an inflationary period related to both steel prices approximately of our sales consist of some type of fastener nuts  bolts  screws  etc 
most of which are made of steel and energy prices a meaningful item for us given the amount of energy that is necessary in the production of our products and in the transportation of our products across north america 
in the fourth quarter of  and throughout much of  this inflation turned to deflation 
when the swings are dramatic  this can hurt our gross margins because we are selling expensive inventory on the shelf at declining prices 
this hurt our gross margins in the drop in energy costs over the same period provided some relief  but it was small in comparison to the impact of deflation 
the deflation of ended and these conditions normalized and allowed our gross margins to recover in and see later discussion on gross margins 
the discussion that follows includes information regarding our sales growth and our sales by product line during this information provides a summary view to understand the dynamics of the year 
however  we feel the real story is told in the monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market information that follow they explain the real impact of the market dynamics affecting us over this period of uncertainty 
over the last several years  we have continued to make significant investments in store locations  national accounts  government sales  internal manufacturing support  international operations now over of our sales  fast solutions sm industrial vending  product expansion with particular emphasis on metalworking products and on exclusive brands  and additional sales specialists to support safety products  metalworking products  and our manufacturing operations 
we are excited about the prospects of each 
as always  the pathway to profit is the cornerstone of our business evolution  and it influences everything we do 
remember  our business centers on our  stores their individual success leads to the success of the entire organization over time 
as always  we will continue to work to complete this task and maintain our goal of growth through customer service 
sales growth net sales and growth rates in net sales were as follows net sales percentage change the increase in net sales in came primarily from higher unit sales 
our growth in net sales was impacted by price changes in our products  but the impact was limited 
our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services  but was helped by initiatives such as fast solutions sm industrial vending 
the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years 
the growth in net sales at the older store locations was helped by the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment  an environment which dramatically worsened late in the change in currencies in foreign countries primarily canada relative to the united states dollar improved our daily sales growth rate by in 
table of contents the increase in net sales in came primarily from higher unit sales 
our growth in net sales was not meaningfully impacted by deflationary or inflationary price changes in our products or by the introduction of new products or services 
the higher unit sales resulted primarily from increases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document and to a lesser degree the opening of new store locations in the last several years 
the growth in net sales at the older store locations was due to the moderating impacts of the current recessionary environment  an environment which dramatically worsened late in the increase in net sales also resulted from the strengthening of the canadian currency relative to the united states dollar and from our holo krome business  which we acquired in december these two items added approximately and percentage points  respectively  to our growth in the decrease in net sales in came primarily from lower unit sales  the decrease was amplified by deflationary price changes  particularly in our steel based products 
our sales change in was not meaningfully impacted by the introduction of new products or services 
the lower unit sales resulted primarily from decreases in sales at older store locations discussed below and again later in this document  this was partially offset by the opening of new stores in the last several years 
the decrease in sales at older store locations was directly related to the economic meltdown that occurred late in and the first part of the impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years ago store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier and opened greater than five years ago store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
these two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets 
the stores opened greater than two years ago represent a consistent same store view of our business store sites opened as follows group opened and earlier  group opened and earlier  and group opened and earlier 
the daily sales change for each of these groups was as follows store age opened greater than years opened greater than years opened greater than years note the age groups above are measured as of the last day of each respective year 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales 
stores opened in contributed approximately  or to net sales and approximately  or to net sales 
the rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years  and  as stated earlier  the sales generated at our older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores 
sales by product line the approximate mix of sales from the original fastener product line and from the other product lines was as follows fastener product line other product lines 
table of contents comments regarding monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market performance note daily sales are defined as the sales for the period divided by the number of business days in the period 
this section focuses on three distinct views of our business monthly sales changes  sequential trends  and end market performance 
the first discussion regarding monthly sales changes provides a good mechanical view of our business based on the age of our stores 
the second discussion provides a framework for understanding the sequential trends that is  comparing a period to the immediately preceding period in our business 
finally  we believe the third discussion regarding end market performance provides insight into activities with our various types of customers 
monthly sales changes all company sales during each of the twelve months in   and  all of our selling locations  when combined  had daily sales growth rates of compared to the comparable month in the preceding year jan

sequential trends we find it helpful to think about the monthly sequential changes in our business using the analogy of climbing a stairway this stairway has several predictable landings where there is a pause in the sequential gain ie april  july  and october to december  but generally speaking  climbs from january to october 
the october landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year 

table of contents history has identified these landings in our business cycle 
they generally relate to months with impaired business days certain holidays 
the first landing centers on easter  which alternates between march and april easter occurred in april in both and  the second landing centers on july th  and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and with the christmas new year holidays 
the holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month to month or because they move around during the week 
the table below shows the pattern to our sequential change in our daily sales 
the line labeled past is an historical average of our sequential daily sales change for the period to we chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics  a weaker industrial economy in north america  and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line 
the and lines represent our actual sequential daily sales changes

a graph of the sequential daily sales change pattern discussed above  starting with a base of in the previous october and ending with the next october  would be as follows logo 
table of contents end market performance fluctuations in end market business the sequential trends noted above were directly linked to fluctuations in our end markets 
to place this in perspective approximately of our business has historically been with customers engaged in some type of manufacturing 
the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  and for the year  as follows q q q q annual the and growth was more pronounced in our industrial production business this is business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by our customers and less pronounced in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business this is business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing 
the contraction was more severe in our industrial production business and less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing business 
these patterns are influenced by the movements noted in the purchasing manufacturers index pmi published by the institute for supply management http www

our non residential construction customers have historically represented to of our business 
the daily sales to these customers grew or contracted in the first  second  third  and fourth quarters when compared to the same quarter in the previous year  and for the year  as follows q q q q annual on a sequential basis  the sales to our manufacturing customers stabilized in may and then started to demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms 
this reversed the negative trend which began in october this stabilization and improvement was partially offset by continued deteriorization in our non residential construction business which weakened dramatically in the first eight months of  and then began to also demonstrate patterns that resemble historical norms 

table of contents a graph of the sequential daily sales trends to these two end markets in   and  starting with a base of in the previous october and ending with the next october  would be as follows manufacturing logo non residential construction logo pathway to profit and its impact on our business in april we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business for most of the preceding ten years  we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business our historical rate was approximately new stores each year 
as announced in april  we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns 
we funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of to per year see our disclosure below regarding store growth in recent periods 
our goal was four fold to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model  to grow the sales of our average store to thousand per month in the five year period from to  to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow  resulting in a growth of our pre tax earnings to of net sales by  and to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital primarily inventory as our average sales volume per store increases 
the economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of and continued into caused us to alter the pathway to profit in these changes centered on two aspects temporarily slowing new store openings to a range of to per year  and temporarily stopping headcount additions except for new store openings and for stores that are growing 
however  as our business trends started to improve late in  we began to increase our planned openings and headcount growth 
see later discussion on future store openings and on store count and full time equivalent fte headcount 
the pathway to profit initiative allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business sales force headcount  store or unit growth  and average sales volume per store  which ultimately drive our level of profitability 
our original goal was to hit the thousand per month store average  and grow our pre tax earnings to of net sales  by we previously disclosed that we believed the duration of the economic weakness could delay the timing of when we achieve these goals by months 
however  in we modified our thought process around the 
table of contents pathway to profit in two regards 
first  the pathway to profit initiative is slowly lowering our cost structure 
with a structurally lowered cost structure and improved gross margins  we concluded we could hit our profitability target in the pathway to profit initiative with average store sales of thousand per month in see evidence of this in our store size and profitability table later in this document 
second  we decided to hire fewer store based employees and instead added resources focused on specific sales opportunities  such as national accounts personnel and dedicated sales specialists manufacturing  government  industry focused  and industrial vending 
the decision to accelerate the addition of non store selling resources into the areas of national accounts and dedicated sales specialists reinforces our belief that these areas represent an efficient manner to accelerate sales at existing stores 
future store openings and increases in fast solutions sm industrial vending in july  we indicated our intentions to open to new stores during the second half of or an annualized rate of to 
during the second half of we opened stores 
for  we originally disclosed our intention to open to new stores  or an annualized rate of to 
as the pmi began to moderate in may see table earlier in this document  our field personnel began to slow their store openings 
as a result  we opened new stores in  or approximately 
in  we expect to open approximately to new stores 
we believe this is a rational reaction to the current pmi and due to the good results we are experiencing with our national accounts and dedicated sales specialists  particularly related to our fast solutions sm industrial vending rollout discussed below 
during and  we closed and seven stores  respectively 
these closures resulted from our belief we could better serve those local markets with a different store footprint 
we have closed stores in our year history 
as was discussed at our investor day in may  we have made significant progress in the development of fast solutions sm industrial vending for our customers 
we believe these solutions have the potential to be transformative to industrial distribution 
some key statistics regarding this business include the following q q q q number of vending machines in contracts signed during the period cumulative machines installed percent of total net sales to customers with vending machines daily sales growth to customers with vending machines not meaningful  due to start up phase this represents the gross number of machines signed during the quarter  not the number of contracts 
this represents the number of machines installed and producing revenue on the last day of the quarter 
the percentage of total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution 
the growth in total sales vended and traditional to customers currently using a vending solution compared to the comparable period in the preceding year 
in addition to the increases in the number of vending machine contracts signed and the sales results noted  we are pleased with the ramp up in our ability to install machines 
in the third and fourth quarter of  we installed  machines  versus  and  machines  versus  respectively  a dramatic increase over the  versus  and machines  versus  installed in the third and fourth quarter of  respectively 

table of contents store count and full time equivalent fte headcount the two tables that follow highlight certain impacts of the pathway to profit 
under the pathway to profit we increased both our store count and our store fte headcount during and however  as indicated earlier  the rate of increase in store locations slowed and our fte headcount for all types of personnel was reduced when the economy weakened late in in the two tables that follow  we refer to our store sales  store locations  store personnel and store profitability 
when we discuss stores in the first table  we are referring to fastenal stores and strategic account stores 
fastenal stores are either a traditional store  the typical format in north america  or an overseas store  which is the typical format outside the united states and canada 
this is discussed in greater detail earlier in this report 
strategic account stores are stores that are focused on selling to a group of large customers in a limited geographic market 
when we discuss in the second table our profitability as the average monthly store sales grow  we are referring to traditional stores 
the sales  outside of our store group  relate to either our in plant locations  the portion of our internally manufactured product that is sold directly to a customer and not through a store including our holo krome business acquired in december  or our direct import business 
the breakdown of our sales  the average monthly sales per store  the number of stores at quarter end  the average headcount at our stores during a quarter  the average fte headcount during a quarter  and the percentage change were as follows for the first quarter of the last completed quarter before we began the pathway to profit  for the third quarter of our peak quarter before the economy weakened  and for each of the last five quarters

table of contents store size and profitability the average age  number of stores  and pre tax earnings data by store size for the fourth quarter of   and  respectively  were as follows average age number of percentage of pre tax earnings sales per month years stores stores percentage three months ended december  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account overseas store company total three months ended december  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account overseas store company total three months ended december  to   to   to   to  over  strategic account overseas store company total note amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 
our original intent under the pathway to profit was to increase the sales of our average store to approximately  per month see earlier discussion in order to meet our pre tax earnings profitability goal of 
this would have shifted the store mix emphasis from the first three categories to   to  and  to  to the last three categories  to   to  and over  and we believe would have allowed us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity 
our goal today is to continue to grow the business and to grow our pre tax earnings as a percent of net sales 
as stated earlier  we now believe  based on the profitability improvements noted in the table above  we can hit our pre tax earnings percent goal of with average store sales of approximately  per month 
note dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars  not thousands 

table of contents statement of earnings information percentage of net sales for the periods ended december twelve month period net sales gross profit operating and administrative expenses loss gain on sale of property and equipment operating income interest income earnings before income taxes note amounts may not foot due to rounding difference 
gross profit relative to sales  was consistent in and and improved from the gross profit percentage in the first  second  third and fourth quarters was as follows q q q q the fluctuations in our gross profit percentages are typically driven by changes in transactional gross profit  organizational gross profit  and vendor incentive gross profit 
the transactional gross profit represents the gross profit realized from the day to day fluctuations in customer pricing relative to product and freight costs 
the organizational gross profit represents the component of gross profit we attribute to buying scale and efficiency gains 
the third component relates to vendor volume allowances 
in the short term  periods of inflation or deflation can influence the first two categories  while sudden changes in business volume can influence the third 
this impact can be magnified  as in  due to the nature of our inventory turns and the dramatic decrease in sales activity during much of the year 
in the past  we have indicated that we believe a normal gross profit percentage range for our business is to 
this is based on our current mix of products  geographies  end markets  and end market uses such as industrial production business versus maintenance business 
we exceeded this range late in  primarily due to inflationary trends in our business 
the impact was evenly split between the transactional and organizational gross profit categories 
this benefit carried into the first quarter of  and quickly dissipated 
in the second quarter of  the trend flipped to deflation and our gross margin began to drop 
about of this drop was evenly split between the same two categories and the other related to the dramatic drop in business volumes and the related drop in vendor incentive gross profit 
in the second half of  these two factors deflation and a drop in business volume  plus the competitive environment of a severe recession  pushed our gross margin to the bottom  and then just below  our expected range 
this drop was equally felt in the three categories noted above 
our business began to expand during and the drag on gross margins related to deflation began to subside 
this allowed our gross margins to move back into the expected range 
in the second quarter of  we moved into the middle of our expected gross profit range as the three components of gross profit improved  the contribution being split fairly evenly between the three components 
we remained in the middle of the expected range until the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  our gross margin felt pressure and dropped to the lower end of our range 
this drop was primarily due to changes in our transactional margin primarily due to changes in product and customer mix  lower vendor incentive gross profit  and lower freight utilization 
the latter two items created half of the gross margin drop and are more of a seasonal issue 

table of contents operating and administrative expenses improved relative to sales in versus both and historically  to of our operating and administrative expenses consist of employee related costs 
the components are payroll which includes cash compensation  stock option expense  and profit sharing  health care  personnel development  and social taxes 
during  these components had reduced to a range between and due to the factors noted below 
during and  this range moved back to the historical level 
the two largest components of employee related costs grew contracted as follows payroll cost health care cost the two largest components of operating and administrative expenses  outside of the employee related costs  grew contracted as follows occupancy selling transportation the increase in payroll costs during and noted above was greater than the change in full time equivalent headcount noted earlier in this document 
this was driven by the following factors sales commissions grew this increase is amplified by sales growth and  in the case of versus  gross margin expansion  both of which have a meaningful impact on the commissions earned  total bonuses earned increased due to our profit growth  hours worked per employee grew  and our profit sharing contribution grew 
the payroll growth in versus was amplified because there were four quarters of strong growth 
in  the first quarter was still at a relatively lower level of pre tax profit 
this expanded for the last three quarters of our health care costs in increased from our health care costs in the third quarter of decreased from the unusual peak in the same period of health care costs in  and the first quarter of  increased dramatically due to the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses lost their insurance coverage at other employers  increases in cobra costs due to changes in federal funding within cobra  and an increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years 
the health care costs represented a more normal level of per employee expenses  relative to and this resulted in a lower level of growth relative to the industry 
the two largest components of the remaining costs within our operating and administrative expenses include occupancy and selling transportation 
occupancy expenses increased from to and increased from to the increase from was driven by a meaningful increase in utilities  a dramatic increase in the amount of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment as discussed earlier in this release we consider the vending equipment to be a logical extension of our store operation and classify the expense as occupancy  an increase in the number of locations  and increased investment in our distribution infrastructure over the last several years 
the selling transportation costs consist primarily of our store fleet as most of the distribution fleet costs are included in cost of sales 
selling transportation costs included in operating and administrative expenses for increased significantly from  a sharp contrast to the prior year s trend 
most of the components of selling transportation costs increased at a rate less than sales growth  with two exceptions  the fuel component and the vehicle depreciation lease payments components increased more than sales growth in this was driven primarily by the increase in per gallon fuel costs discussed below and the expansion of our fleet related to additions to our non store sales personnel  particularly industrial vending vehicles 

table of contents the last several years have seen meaningful swings in the cost of diesel fuel and gasoline during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately    and million  respectively 
during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  our total vehicle fuel costs were approximately    and million  respectively 
the changes resulted from variations in fuel costs  variations in the service levels provided to our stores from our distribution centers  changes in the number of vehicles at our store locations  and changes in the number of other sales centered vehicles 
these fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles semi tractors  straight trucks  and sprinter trucks which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery and other sales centered vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses the split in the last several years has been approximately between distribution and store and other sales centered use 
the average per gallon fuel costs in actual dollars and the percentage change on a year over year basis for the last three years was as follows annual per gallon average price q q q q average price diesel fuel gasoline price diesel fuel gasoline price diesel fuel gasoline per gallon price change q q q q annual change diesel fuel gasoline change diesel fuel gasoline average of the four quarterly figures contained in the table 
loss on sale of property and equipment the loss on sale of property and equipment for and came primarily from the sale of used vehicles 
income taxes incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  were approximately   and for   and  respectively 
this rate fluctuates over time based on the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate  the level of profits in those jurisdictions  and changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions 

table of contents net earnings net earnings  net earnings per share eps  percentage change in net earnings  and the percentage change in eps  were as follows dollar amounts net earnings basic eps diluted eps percentage change net earnings basic eps diluted eps during  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the effective management of operating expenses and a slightly lower income tax rate 
during  the net earnings increase was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors included in the discussion on the improvements in the gross margin percentage and in the growth in operating expenses which was dramatically less than sales growth 
during  the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion 
the eps percentage change was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in and operational working capital operational working capital  which we define as accounts receivable and inventories  are highlighted below 
the annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows dollar change accounts receivable inventories operational working capital annual percentage change accounts receivable inventories operational working capital the growth in accounts receivable noted above is driven by our sales growth in the final two months of the period 
the strong growth in recent years with our international business and with large customer accounts has created some difficulty with managing the growth of accounts receivable relative to the growth in sales 
our growth in inventory balances over time does not have as direct a relationship to our monthly sales patterns as does our growth in accounts receivable 
this is impacted by other aspects of our business 
for example  the dramatic economic slowdown in late and early caused our inventory to spike 
this occurred because the lead time for inventory procurement is typically longer than the visibility we have into future monthly sales patterns 
over the last decade  we increased our relative inventory levels due to the following new store openings  expanded stocking breadth at individual stores  expanded stocking breadth at our distributions centers for example  our master stocking hub in indianapolis expanded its product breadth over six fold from to  expanded direct sourcing  expanded exclusive brands  and  more recently  expanded fast solutions sm industrial vending 
we believe these were excellent investments for our business 
these investments have  and we believe will continue to  leverage our sales growth 
the discussion above covers inventory from a longer perspective  in more recent quarters  our expanding inventories are also related to our expanding sales growth trends with emphasis on our large account business both oem and mro  our confidence in their sustainability  international expansion  and in recent months  some inflation 
however  this expansion has been at a rate less than sales growth which has allowed us to improve our inventory utilization 

table of contents as we indicated in earlier communications  our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory annual sales ar i back to a better than a ratio 
on december  and  we had a ratio of and  respectively 
acquisition on december   we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products a type of fastener 
the business had an established name  holo krome  and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate employees 
the business did not have a meaningful impact on our financial results there were some balance sheet impacts of the all cash acquisition  as noted in our cash flow statement 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on our overall sales in and liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash provided of net earnings the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in earnings 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to increases in working capital due to our growth in sales 
the net cash provided by operating activities was unusually high primarily due to the weak economy and the decrease in working capital needed in the business 
the approximate percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on december store distribution center total new stores open with the standard store model  which consists of a core stocking level of approximately thousand per location 
this inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net cash used of net earnings 
table of contents net property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows net capital expenditures of net earnings the net cash used in investing activities and net expenditures for property and equipment both increased from to the increase was caused by the dramatic increase in the number of fast solutions sm industrial vending equipment deployed in our business 
the net cash used in investing activities was largely unchanged from to however  the net expenditures for property and equipment purchases less proceeds of disposals increased from to  primarily due to expansions at our indianapolis  indiana distribution center and increased spending for our fast solutions sm industrial vending

disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick up trucks  semi tractors  and trailers in the normal course of business  and the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations 
an estimate of our net capital expenditures and a recap of our and net capital expenditures is provided below 
as of year end  we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
we anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations  from available cash and cash equivalents  and  if necessary  from our borrowing capacity 
in addition to opening new stores in the united states  we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets

effects of inflation we noted minimal price changes in and price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in critical accounting policies our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts this reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible 
the reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of a customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers 
inventory reserve this reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage 
the reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends 
the analysis includes inventory levels  sales information  physical inventory counts  cycle count adjustments  and the on hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
health insurance reserve this reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
general insurance reserve this reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation  property and casualty losses  and other self insured losses 
the reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends 
historically  results have reflected the reserves previously recorded 
we believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results 
tax strategies our effective income tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we establish income tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing 
if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  we recognize the benefit 
we measure the benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
we presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
we regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities 
we re evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit  or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit  when i there is a completion of a tax audit  ii there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance  or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitations 
significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities  positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective income tax rate in future periods 
legal reserves occasionally we are involved in legal matters 
the outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some actions  the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures 
we record a liability for these legal matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other  the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if a loss is reasonably possible  but not known or probable  and can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in most cases  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded 
although we believe we have adequately provided for probable losses from litigation  the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially different from reserves recorded 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic 
this accounting standard update eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity and requires the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
it also requires presentation on the face of the financial statements of reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
this accounting standard update is effective beginning in our first quarter of fiscal in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this update approved a revised accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity tests goodwill for impairment 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
we adopted this accounting standard update in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
proposed accounting pronouncements in recent exposure drafts  the international accounting standards board iasb and the fasb proposed a new approach to the accounting for leases 
from a lessee s perspective  the exposure drafts propose to abolish the distinction between operating and finance capital leases 
in its place  a right of use model would be used 
this proposal  as currently written  would require the lessee to recognize an asset for its right to use the underlying leased asset and a liability for its obligation to make lease payments 
this would lead to an increase in assets and liabilities for leases currently classified as an operating lease and could also lead to a change in timing as to when the expense is recognized 
this exposure draft is not yet finalized  however  we believe knowledge of this information is useful to the reader of our financial statements as many of our store locations and many of our vehicles are currently leased  and those leases are accounted for as operating leases 
geographic information information regarding our revenues and long lived assets by geographic area is set forth in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
risks related to our foreign operations are described earlier in this form k under the heading certain risks and uncertainties and item a 
risk factors 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity pricing 
changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
we evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency fluctuations can affect our net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
our estimated net earnings exposure for foreign currency exchange rates was not material at year end 
commodity steel pricing we buy and sell various types of steel products  these products consist primarily of different types of threaded fasteners 
during the last decade  there has been nominal movement in overall steel pricing  with some deflation occurring in the wake of the economic crisis of the far east markets that occurred in the late s 
this trend reversed to inflation in the period from late to the early part of and again from mid to the fall of in the first half of  we noted meaningful deflation 
in  we noted minimal price changes except for stainless steel which did inflate 
stainless steel products represent approximately of our business 
in  we noted nominal price increases 
we are exposed to the impacts of commodity steel pricing and our related ability to pass through the impacts to our end customers 
commodity fuel prices we have market risk for changes in gasoline and diesel fuel  however  this risk is mitigated in part by our ability to pass freight costs to our customers and the efficiency of our trucking distribution network
