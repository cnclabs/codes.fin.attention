the difference between the fair value and the principal amount of the convertible notes was million 
this amount was recorded as a debt discount and as an increase to additional paid in capital as of the issuance date 
the current unamortized discount of million is being accreted to interest expense over the remaining year period to the maturity date of the notes in december resulting in an increase in non cash interest expense 
convertible senior notes as of january   the company had million of convertible senior notes outstanding that bear interest at a rate of per annum and mature in the provisions of the convertible notes allow the holder to convert the notes to shares of the company s common stock at a conversion rate of shares per one thousand dollars in principal amount of notes subject to an anti dilution adjustment 
the holder may put the debt back to the company in or and the convertible notes became callable at the option of the company beginning on march  the company can settle a conversion of the notes with shares  cash  or a combination thereof at its discretion 
the holders may convert the notes at the following times  among others i if the company s share price is greater than of the applicable conversion price for a certain trading period  ii if the credit ratings of the convertible notes are below a certain threshold  or iii upon the occurrence of certain consolidations  mergers or share exchange transactions involving the company

the discount is being amortized over the expected life of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component considering the effects of embedded features other than the conversion option 
since the holders of the convertible notes have put options in and  the debt instrument is being accreted to par value using the effective interest method from issuance until the first put date in  resulting in an increase in non cash interest expense 
the current unamortized discount of million will be recognized over the remaining year period 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash on hand  availability under its revolving credit facility  and access to various capital markets to repay both the convertible notes at maturity 
capital leases as of january   the company had million in capital leases covering various properties and pieces of equipment

in addition  other unrecorded obligations that have been excluded from the contractual obligations table include contingent rent payments  property taxes  insurance payments  amounts that might come due under change in control provisions of employment agreements  and common area maintenance costs 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized tax benefits at january   the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
the company has not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements which would be reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect  such as obligations under certain guarantees or contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements  obligations under certain derivative arrangements  and obligations under material variable interests

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain judgments and estimates utilized in implementing these accounting policies are likewise discussed in each of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion sets forth the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies and estimates and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under varying conditions and assumptions 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of merchandise at the company s retail stores is recognized at the time customers provide a satisfactory form of payment and take delivery of the merchandise 
revenue from the sale of merchandise from saks direct is recognized upon estimated receipt of merchandise by the customer 
the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned for a refund based on historical trends and reduces sales and gross margin by that amount 
given that approximately of merchandise sold is later returned and that the vast majority of merchandise returns occur within a short time after the selling transaction  the risk of the company realizing a materially different amount for sales and gross margin than reported in the consolidated financial statements is minimal 
revenue associated with gift cards is recognized upon redemption by the customer 
breakage income associated with unredeemed gift cards is recognized if the gift card is not subject to state escheatment laws when the likelihood of customer redemption is determined to be remote 
cost of sales and inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the retail first in  first out fifo method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are determined by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the cost of the inventory reflected on the consolidated balance sheet is decreased with a charge to cost of sales contemporaneous with the lowering of the retail value of the inventory on the sales floor through the use of markdowns 
hence  earnings are negatively impacted as the merchandise is being devalued with markdowns prior to the sale of the merchandise 
the areas requiring significant management judgment include setting the original retail value for the merchandise held for sale  recognizing merchandise for which the customer s perception of value has declined and appropriately marking the retail value of the merchandise down to the perceived value  and estimating the shrinkage that has occurred through theft during the period between physical inventory counts 
these judgments and estimates  coupled with the averaging processes within the retail method  can  under certain circumstances  produce varying financial results 
factors that can lead to different financial results include setting original retail prices for merchandise held for sale too high  failure to identify a decline in perceived value of inventories and process the appropriate retail value markdowns  and overly optimistic or overly conservative inventory shrinkage estimates 
the company believes it has the appropriate merchandise valuation and pricing controls in place to minimize the risk that its inventory values would be materially under or overvalued 
the company regularly records a provision for estimated shrinkage  thereby reducing the carrying value of merchandise inventory 
a complete physical inventory of all of the company s stores and distribution facilities is performed annually  with the recorded amount of merchandise inventory being adjusted to coincide with this physical count 
the differences between the estimated amount of shrinkage and the actual amount realized have been insignificant 
the company receives vendor provided support in different forms 
when vendors provide support for inventory markdowns  the company records the support as a reduction of cost of sales 
such support is recorded in the period that the corresponding markdowns are taken 
when the company receives inventory related support that is not designated for markdowns  the company includes this support as a reduction of the cost of purchases 
self insurance reserves the company self insures a substantial portion of its exposure for costs related primarily to employee medical  workers compensation and general liability 
expenses are recorded based on estimates for reported claims and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported  considering a number of factors  including historical claims experience  severity factors  litigation costs  inflation and other assumptions 
although the company does not expect the amount it will ultimately pay to differ significantly from its estimates  self insurance reserves could be affected if future claims experience differs significantly from the historical trends and assumptions 

table of contents depreciation and recoverability of capital assets over of the company s assets at january  are represented by investments in property and equipment 
determining appropriate depreciable lives and reasonable assumptions for use in evaluating the carrying value of capital assets requires judgments and estimates 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
land is not depreciated 
buildings and building improvements are depreciated over to years 
store fixtures are depreciated over years 
equipment utilized in stores eg  escalators and in support areas eg  distribution centers  technology and fixtures in support areas are depreciated over to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or their related lease terms  generally ranging from to years 
costs incurred for the development of internal use software are capitalized and amortized over to years 
generally  there is no estimated salvage value at the end of the useful life of the assets 
costs incurred when constructing stores  including interest expense  are capitalized 
the company may receive allowances from landlords related to the construction 
if the landlord is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the property  then the portion of those allowances attributable to the property owned by the landlord is considered to be a deferred rent liability  whereas the corresponding capital expenditures related to that store are considered to be prepaid rent 
allowances in excess of the amounts attributable to the property owned by the landlord are considered improvement allowances and are recorded as deferred rent liabilities that are amortized over the life of the lease 
capital expenditures are also reduced when the company receives cash and allowances from merchandise vendors to fund the construction of vendor shops 
to the extent the company remodels or otherwise replaces or disposes of property and equipment prior to the end of their assigned depreciable lives  the company could realize a gain or loss on the disposition 
to the extent assets continue to be used beyond their assigned depreciable lives  no depreciation expense is recognized 
the company reassesses the depreciable lives in an effort to reduce the risk of significant losses or gains at disposition and utilization of assets with no depreciation charges 
the reassessment of depreciable lives involves utilizing historical remodel and disposition activity and forward looking capital expenditure plans 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  such as opening a new store near an existing store  announcing plans for a store closure  a history of store operating losses  etc

store lease agreements generally include rent holidays  rent escalation clauses  and contingent rent provisions that require additional payments based on a percentage of sales in excess of specified levels 
contingent rental payments are recognized when the company determines that it is probable that the specified levels will be reached during the fiscal year 
for leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases  the company recognizes rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term from the date the company takes possession of the leased property 
the difference between the straight line rent amounts and amounts payable under the lease agreements are recorded as deferred rent 
tenant improvement allowances and other lease incentives are recorded as deferred rent liabilities and are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease

the company concluded  based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence that all but million of these tax benefits relating to certain state losses are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
therefore  a valuation allowance for the million has been established 
the company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
in and  this evaluation resulted in a net reduction to the reserve against state deferred tax assets of million and million  impacting the company s results of operations 
a similar analysis was performed in  which resulted in an additional reserve against state deferred tax assets of million

the projected unit credit method is utilized in computing the pension obligations 
net periodic benefit cost is based on actuarial models used to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to participants and is allocated to the respective service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate benefit costs are reviewed annually 
pension assumptions are based upon management s best estimates as of the annual measurement date 
the discount rate is primarily used in calculating the company s pension obligation  which is represented by the accumulated benefit obligation abo and the projected benefit obligation pbo and in calculating net periodic benefit cost 
the discount rate utilized is based upon pension discount curves and bond portfolio curves over a duration that is similar to the expected future cash flows of the plans as of the measurement date 
the discount rate used to calculate the abo and pbo as of january  was and for the pension plan and serp  respectively 
to the extent the discount rate increases or decreases  the company s pbo is decreased or increased  respectively 
the estimated effect of a change in the discount rate is approximately million on the pbo and approximately million on net periodic benefit cost 
to the extent the pbo increases  the after tax effect of such increases would reduce other comprehensive income and shareholders equity 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is used primarily in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of the company s net periodic benefit cost 
the company s estimate of the expected long term rate of return considers the historical returns on plan assets  as well as the future expectations of returns on classes of assets within the target asset allocation of the plan asset portfolio 
the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets is the weighted average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the pbo 
the company s investment strategy is to maintain a diversified portfolio of assets with the primary goal of ensuring that funds are available to meet the pension plan s benefit obligations when they become due  while maintaining an appropriate level of risk 
the pension plan s target asset allocation is determined by the company s retirement committee and as of january   the pension plan s target asset allocation was approximately equity  fixed income  and real estate 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized is greater than or less than the assumed rate of return  that year s net periodic benefit cost is not affected 
rather  the gain or loss is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and would reduce or increase future net periodic benefit cost over the average life expectancy of the plan s participants  to the extent that the cumulative gains or losses exceed of the greater of the pbo or market related value of plan assets 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets was in the estimated effect of a change in the long term rate of return on plan assets is million on the net periodic benefit cost 

table of contents the assumed average rate of compensation increase is the average annual compensation increase expected over the remaining employment periods for the participating employees and is primarily used in calculating the pbo and net periodic benefit cost
