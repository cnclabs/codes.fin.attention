customer demand for blue collar staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the labor market and trends towards greater workforce flexibility within the blue collar markets in which we operate 
improving economic growth typically results in increasing demand for labor  resulting in greater demand for our staffing services 
during periods of increasing demand  we are able to produce strong incremental operating margins by leveraging the increase in revenue across our fixed cost structure 
future growth trends will be dependent on whether the underlying economy continues to improve  trends in customer preference towards a more flexible workforce continue  and our ability to effectively serve customer needs 
results of operations the following table presents the consolidated statements of operations as a percent of revenue in millions  except percentages and per share amounts revenue from services total revenue growth decline gross profit as a of revenue selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a of revenue income from operations income from operations as a of revenue net income net income per diluted share revenue from services revenue from services for each of the past three years is as follows in millions revenue from services total revenue growth decline revenue grew to billion for  a increase compared to the prior year 
fiscal included weeks ended december  revenue for grew by compared to the prior year on a comparable week basis 
we define a comparable week basis as the same beginning and ending calendar date ranges 
the strong revenue growth was primarily driven by strong demand for our services across most major industries and geographies 
we experienced double digit revenue growth in most of the industry groups we serve 
our construction industry growth remains strong due to our success in serving renewable energy projects while demand for residential construction remains weak 
our results were driven by increased success with our vertical market sales and service strategy 
our dedicated sales leaders have expertise in the specific industries we serve 
they partner with our national sales and service teams to meet the specific project needs of our national customers 
likewise  they provide our branches with best practice industry knowledge including sales and service methods for each industry 
our local sales and service teams build strong customer relationships and loyalty in providing tailored solutions that meet the day to day needs of our local customers 
we invested in specialized sales and marketing personnel to sell to and serve our vertical market customer groups 
our vertical market specialists and their programs are making significant contributions to our revenue growth 
we are well positioned to capture growing customer demand by meeting their specific needs with our dedicated employees 
the year over year growth was partially offset by the anticipated decline in work associated with projects for our largest customer 
excluding this impact and the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal  revenue growth was for fiscal  for fiscal and a decline of for fiscal our business experiences seasonal fluctuations 
our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of our customers businesses as well as timing and duration of project work 
demand for our staffing services is higher during the second and third quarters of the year with demand peaking in the third quarter and lower during the first and fourth quarters  in part due to limitations to outside work during the winter months 
our quarterly revenue trends in comparison with the same period in prior years are as follows in millions revenue growth decline first quarter revenue from services first quarter revenue growth decline second quarter revenue from services second quarter revenue growth decline third quarter revenue from services third quarter revenue growth decline fourth quarter revenue from services fourth quarter revenue growth decline fiscal included weeks ended december  the final quarter of fiscal consisted of weeks 
excluding the th week of  revenue grew by for the fourth quarter of as compared to the quarterly revenue growth trends for were due to continued economic recovery and success of our vertical market specialization to meet the unique needs of customer groups within the blue collar staffing market 
the post recession economic recovery has been uncertain which we believe has positively impacted the temporary staffing industry 
likewise  we believe our vertical market sales and service strategies contributed to our growth 
revenue for increased compared to  or excluding the impact of the rd week of we believe the revenue growth was primarily driven by the economic recovery and our growth strategies 
gross profit gross profit for each of the past three fiscal years is as follows in millions gross profit percentage of revenue gross profit represents revenues from services less direct costs of services  which consist of payroll  payroll taxes  workers compensation insurance costs and reimbursable costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was unchanged compared to fiscal due to offsetting factors 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal included the benefit of hire act credits  net of other payroll tax items  of of revenue 
the hire act provided incentives for hiring and retaining workers by exempting the employer share of the social security tax on wages paid to qualified individuals beginning on march  and expired on december  excluding the benefit of these net hire act credits  gross profit as a percent of revenue for the current year has improved by 
the improvement is primarily due to the success of our disciplined pricing and increased billing rates 
workers compensation expense was of revenue for fiscal and for fiscal we continue to actively manage the safety of our temporary workers with our risk management programs and work together with our network of service providers to control costs 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue for fiscal declined as compared to fiscal the decline is primarily due to revenue mix  increased costs associated with our temporary workers  and higher workers compensation expense 
our mix of blue collar staffing business has shifted to service more national and large industrial customers for which demand remained stronger than for small to medium sized business during the recession and subsequent recovery 
the gross margins for some of our national and large industrial customers are lower than our blended company average 
the increased cost of our temporary workers resulted primarily from increased state unemployment taxes and certain other payroll taxes which were in part passed through to our customers 
increased cost of our temporary workers was partially offset by the incentives from the hire act 
workers compensation expense was of revenue for fiscal versus of revenue for fiscal the success of our risk management programs resulted in reducing prior estimated claim settlement costs 
however  those reductions were less in as compared to resulting in increased workers compensation expense as a percent of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for each of the past three fiscal years are as follows in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue sg a declined to as a percentage of revenue for fiscal as compared to for fiscal during we produced strong incremental operating margins as we leveraged our fixed cost structure 
the increase in sg a spending for is primarily due to two factors 
first  we experienced an expected increase in variable expenses to support the increased revenue of million over the prior year 
second  we invested in specialized sales and marketing personnel to sell to and serve our vertical market customer groups 
our vertical market specialists and their programs are making significant contributions to our revenue growth 
we also filled open sales and service positions in local markets and made a variety of market adjustment increases to compensation to retain our key performers 
staffing levels have increased from recessionary lows and our turnover has declined 
we believe these investments have accelerated our revenue growth trends during and will positively impact future years 
given the uncertainty surrounding the strength and longevity of the current economic recovery  we remain focused on leveraging our cost structure which should produce strong incremental operating margins with additional future revenue 
the decrease in sg a as a percentage of revenue for as compared to was the result of increased revenues without a corresponding increase to sg a 
the decrease in sg a during was also due to a combination of cost reduction actions in and aggressive cost containment in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization for each of the past three fiscal years are as follows in millions depreciation and amortization percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization for is in line with the prior year 
depreciation decreased for fiscal as compared to by million resulting primarily from reduced capital spending during the economic recession 
capital spending is focused primarily on enterprise technology improvement projects which will further improve our efficiency and effectiveness in recruiting and retaining our temporary workers and attracting and retaining our customers 
interest and other income  net net interest income for fiscal increased over due to two factors 
first  yields on our restricted cash and investments have increased 
second  we renewed our revolving credit facility during fiscal with lower fees and cost to borrow 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in  as compared to and in and  respectively 
the principal difference between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective income tax rate results from state and foreign income taxes  federal tax credits  and certain non deductible expenses 
the lower effective tax rates in were primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters from prior years 
results of operations future outlook the following highlights represent our expectations in regard to operating trends for fiscal year these expectations are subject to revision as our business changes with the overall economy due to our industry s sensitivity to economic factors  the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of the economy and the short term nature of staffing assignments  our visibility for future demand is limited 
as a result  we monitor a number of economic indicators as well as certain trends to estimate future revenue 
based on these anticipated trends  we expect continued revenue growth in assuming the economy is similar to that of fiscal however  our revenue growth percentage will diminish due to more challenging prior period revenue comparisons versus the prior period comparables for our top priority remains to increase revenue through our existing branch network and improve margins 
this should produce strong incremental operating margins as we leverage our cost structure across additional organic revenue 
we will continue to invest in our sales and customer service programs which we believe will enhance our ability to capitalize on further revenue growth and customer retention 
as the economy grows  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence 
all of our multi location brands have opportunities to expand through new physical locations or by sharing existing locations 
where possible  we plan to expand the presence of our brands by sharing existing locations to achieve cost synergies 
we plan to build on our success with centralized recruitment and dispatch of our temporary workers to locations without physical branches and expand our geographic reach 
we will also evaluate strategic acquisitions in the blue collar staffing market that can produce strong returns on investment 
our focus is on acquisitions that can accelerate the building of a national presence for a particular brand or that provide an opportunity to serve a new  but sizable portion of the blue collar staffing market 
minimum wage and certain unemployment taxes will increase again in our best estimate of this impact  assuming no action on our part  is an increase that would negatively impact gross margin by to of revenue 
we have put in place programs to pass these costs through to our customers 
until the economy fully recovers and state unemployment funds have been replenished and related federal loans have been repaid by certain states  we expect continued increases to our unemployment taxes and our customers could be resistant to price increases to cover these costs 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows 
our net income and  consequently  our cash provided from operations are impacted by sales volume  seasonal sales patterns and profit margins 
over the past three fiscal years  net cash provided by operations was approximately million 
cash flows from operating activities our cash flows provided by operating activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions net income depreciation and amortization provision for doubtful accounts stock based compensation deferred income taxes other operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities accounts receivable income tax receivable accounts payable and other accrued expenses workers compensation claims reserve other assets and liabilities net cash provided by operating activities accounts receivable increased by million in about half of the increase in accounts receivable was due to an increase in days sales outstanding and the rest was due to continued revenue growth 
days sales outstanding were higher primarily due to a higher mix of larger customers with longer payment terms compared with prior periods 
the provision for doubtful accounts continued to decline in and reflects the improving economy and ability of our customers to pay 
income taxes receivable declined in due to unanticipated deductions which resulted in over payments of estimated taxes in increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses during were associated with increased revenue as a result of the economic recovery and corresponding increases to temporary labor payroll expense  as well as increased unemployment tax rates 
generally  our workers compensation reserve for estimated claims increases as temporary labor services increase and decreases as temporary labor services decline 
during  our workers compensation reserve increased as we increased temporary labor services offset by the timing of payments 
cash flows used in investing activities our cash flows used in investing activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions capital expenditures change in restricted cash and cash equivalents purchases of restricted investments maturities of restricted investments other net cash used in investing activities capital expenditures were primarily due to significant investments made to upgrade our proprietary information systems 
we anticipate that total capital expenditures will be approximately million in restricted cash and investments consist primarily of collateral that has been provided or pledged to insurance carriers and state workers compensation programs 
we are required by our insurance carriers to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation 
prior to march   chartis held the majority of the restricted cash collateralizing our self insured workers compensation policies 
as of march   we entered into an agreement with chartis and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust the trust at the bank of new york mellon  which holds the majority of our collateral obligations 
placing the collateral in the trust allows us to manage the investment of the assets 
the majority of those funds have been invested 
the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents when combined with purchases of restricted investments net of maturities of restricted investments increased by million for and includes additional restricted cash and investments required as collateral due to growth 
other includes the purchase of a staffing company and a technology company in the technology acquired will be integrated with our proprietary front end systems to better attract and retain our temporary workers and serve our customers 
cash flows used in financing activities our cash flows used in financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years were as follows in millions purchases and retirement of common stock net proceeds from sale of stock through options and employee benefit plans common stock repurchases for taxes upon vesting of restricted stock payments on debt other net cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by repurchases of million shares of our common stock in future outlook we are in a strong financial position to fund working capital needs for planned growth 
the strength of our current financial position is highlighted as follows we have cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  our borrowing availability under our credit facility is principally based on accounts receivable and the value of our corporate building 
we have million of borrowing available under our credit facility as of december  we believe the credit facility provides adequate borrowing availability 
the majority of our workers compensation payments are made from restricted cash versus cash from operations 
at december   approximately two thirds of our workers compensation reserve was covered by restricted cash 
on july   we filed a million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  which allows us to sell various securities in amounts and prices determined at the time of sale 
the filing enables us to access capital efficiently and quickly if needed pending current market conditions 
no shares have been issued under this registration 
we believe that cash provided from operations and our capital resources will be adequate to meet our cash requirements over the next twelve months  and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
however  should economic conditions again deteriorate our financial results would be adversely impacted and we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
these additional sources of financing may not be available  or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
capital resources on september   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na and wells fargo capital finance  llc for a secured revolving credit facility of up to a maximum of million the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility  which expires september  amended and restated our prior million revolving credit facility with wells fargo capital finance  llc and bank of america  na  which was set to expire in june of the maximum amount we can borrow under the revolving credit facility of million is subject to certain borrowing limits the borrowing base 
we are limited to the sum of of our eligible accounts receivable  and of the liquidation value of our tacoma headquarters office building not to exceed million 
the amount is then reduced by the sum of a reserve in an amount equal to the payroll and payroll taxes for our temporary employees for one payroll cycle and other reserves if deemed applicable 
as of december   the maximum million was available under the revolving credit facility and letters of credit in the amount of million had been issued against the facility  leaving an unused portion of million 
the revolving credit facility requires that we maintain liquidity in excess of million 
we are required to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio in the event we do not meet that requirement 
liquidity is defined as the amount we are entitled to borrow as advances under the revolving credit facility plus the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in accounts subject to a control agreement benefiting the lenders 
the amount we were entitled to borrow at december  was million and the amount of cash and cash equivalents under control agreements was million for a total of million which is well in excess of the liquidity requirement 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants related to the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we pay a variable rate of interest on funds borrowed that is based on libor or the prime rate  at our option  plus an applicable spread based on excess liquidity as set forth below excess liquidity prime rate loans libor rate loans greater than million equal to or greater than million to equal to or less than million less than million a fee on borrowing availability of is also applied against the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
letters of credit are priced at the margin in effect for libor loans  plus a fronting fee of 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by substantially all of our domestic personal property and our headquarters located in tacoma  washington 
we have agreements with certain financial institutions that allow us to restrict cash and cash equivalents and investments for the purpose of providing collateral instruments to our insurance carriers to satisfy workers compensation claims 
at december   we had restricted cash and investments totaling approximately million 
as of march   we entered into an agreement with chartis and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust which holds the majority of our collateral obligations under existing workers compensation insurance policies previously held directly by chartis 
we established investment policy directives for the trust  with the first priority to be preservation of capital  second to maintain and ensure a high degree of liquidity  and third to maximize after tax returns 
trust investments must meet minimum acceptable quality standards 
the primary investments include us treasury securities  us agency debentures  us agency mortgages  corporate securities  and municipal securities 
for those investments rated by the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the minimum ratings are s p moody s fitch short term rating a sp p mig f long term rating a a a workers compensation insurance  collateral and claims reserves workers compensation insurance we provide workers compensation insurance for our temporary and permanent employees 
our workers compensation insurance policies are renewed annually 
we renewed our coverage with chartis effective july to july we are also self insured with certain state workers compensation programs  which are typically renewed on an annual basis 
the majority of our current workers compensation insurance policies cover claims for a particular event above a million deductible limit  on a per occurrence basis 
this results in our being substantially self insured 
while we have primary responsibility for all claims  our insurance coverage provides reimbursement for certain losses and expenses beyond our deductible limits excess claims 
we have full liability for all remaining payments on claims that originated between january and june  without recourse to any third party insurer as the result of a novation agreement we entered into with kemper insurance company in december prior to  we were insured by various carriers who are now insolvent and as a result we are substantially reserved for any claims above the self insurance limit 
workers compensation collateral our insurance carriers and certain state workers compensation programs require us to collateralize a portion of our workers compensation obligation  for which they become responsible should we become insolvent 
the collateral typically takes the form of cash and cash backed instruments  letters of credit  and or surety bonds 
on an annual  or as needed basis these entities assess the amount of collateral they will require from us relative to our workers compensation obligation 
such amounts can increase or decrease independent of our assessments and reserves 
we generally anticipate that our collateral commitments will continue to grow 
we pay our premiums and deposit our collateral in installments 
chartis holds the majority of the restricted cash collateralizing our self insured workers compensation policies 
at december  and december  our total collateral commitments were made up of the following components in millions cash collateral held by insurance carriers cash and cash equivalents held in trust investments held in trust letters of credit surety bonds total collateral commitments during the first quarter of  we entered into an agreement with chartis and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust at the bank of new york mellon which holds the majority of our collateral obligations 
included in this amount is million of accrued interest at december we have agreements with certain financial institutions to issue letters of credit on our behalf under the revolving credit facility 
we had million and million of restricted cash collateralizing our letters of credit at december  and december   respectively 
our surety bonds are issued by independent insurance companies on our behalf and bear annual fees based on a percentage of the bond  which is determined by each independent surety carrier  but do not exceed of the bond amount  subject to a minimum charge 
the terms of these bonds are subject to review and renewal every one to four years and most bonds can be canceled by the sureties with as little as days notice 
we had million of restricted cash collateralizing our surety bonds at december  during the second quarter of  our obligation to collateralize our surety bonds was released 
the following table provides a reconciliation of our collateral commitments to our workers compensation reserve as of the period end dates presented in millions total workers compensation reserve add back discount on reserves less excess claims reserve reimbursable payments to insurance provider less portion of workers compensation not requiring collateral total collateral commitments our workers compensation reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value while our collateral commitments are based on the gross  undiscounted reserve 
workers compensation reserve includes the estimated obligation for claims above our deductible limits 
these are the responsibility of the insurance carriers against which there are no collateral requirements 
this amount is included in restricted cash and represents a timing difference between claim payments made by our insurance carrier and the reimbursement from cash held in the trust 
when claims are paid by our carrier  the amount is removed from the workers compensation reserve but not removed from collateral until reimbursed to the carrier 
workers compensation reserve our workers compensation reserve is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses  which are discounted to their estimated net present value 
the discounted workers compensation claims reserve was million at december  our workers compensation reserve for self insured claims is established using estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  as well as those that have been incurred but not reported 
reserves are estimated for claims incurred in the current year  as well as claims incurred during prior years 
management evaluates the adequacy of the workers compensation reserves in conjunction with an independent quarterly actuarial assessment 
factors we consider in establishing and adjusting these reserves include the estimates provided by our independent actuary and appropriate discount rates 
factors considered by management with the assistance of our independent actuary include  among other things changes in medical and time loss indemnity costs  mix changes between medical only and indemnity claims  regulatory and legislative developments that have increased benefits and settlement requirements  mix changes between the types of work performed  the impact of safety initiatives implemented  and  positive or adverse development of claim reserves 
our workers compensation claims reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value using discount rates based on returns of risk free us treasury instruments with maturities comparable to the weighted average lives of our workers compensation claims 
our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to claims above our deductible limits excess claims  and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance carriers 
we discount this reserve and corresponding receivable to its estimated net present value using the discount rates based on average returns of risk free us treasury instruments available during the year in which the liability was incurred 
the discounted workers compensation reserve for excess claims and the corresponding receivable for the insurance on excess claims was million as of december  the following table provides an analysis of changes in our workers compensation claims reserves in millions 
beginning balance self insurance reserve expenses related to current year  net payments related to current year claims payments related to claims from prior years changes to prior years self insurance reserve  net amortization of prior years discount net change in excess claims reserve ending balance less current portion long term portion our self insurance reserves are discounted to their estimated net present value using discount rates based on returns of risk free us treasury instruments with maturities comparable to the weighted average lives of our workers compensation claims 
at december   the weighted average rate was 
payments made against self insured claims are made over a weighted average period of approximately years 
changes in reserve estimates are reflected in the income statement in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
any changes to the estimated weighted average lives and corresponding discount rates for actual payments made are reflected in the income statement in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
changes to the workers compensation reserve for claims above our self insured limits excess claims net of discount to its estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims 
at december   the weighted average rate was 
the excess claim payments are made and the corresponding reimbursements from our insurance carriers are received over a weighted average period of approximately years 
two of the workers compensation insurance companies with which we formerly did business are in liquidation and have failed to pay a number of excess claims to date 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of the insurance receivables from the insurance companies in liquidation 
contractual obligations and commitments we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain contractual obligations  such as operating leases  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed 
there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the following table provides a summary of our contractual obligations as of the end of fiscal we expect to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash equivalents  and cash flows from operations 
payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total through through and later operating leases capital leases purchase obligations other obligations total contractual cash obligations excludes all payments related to branch leases cancelable within days purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable  legally binding and specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
includes million for liability for unrecognized tax benefits and million for future payments related to acquisition 
summary of critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
workers compensation reserves we maintain reserves for workers compensation claims  including the excess claims portion above our deductible  using actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses 
these estimates include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these reserves  which reflect potential liabilities to be paid in future periods based on estimated payment patterns  are discounted to estimated net present value using discount rates based on average returns on risk free us treasury instruments  which are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate the reserves regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
if the actual cost of such claims and related expenses exceed the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
changes in reserve estimates are reflected in the income statement in the period when the changes in estimates are made 
our workers compensation reserves include estimated expenses related to claims above our self insured limits excess claims and a corresponding receivable for the insurance coverage on excess claims based on the contractual policy agreements we have with insurance companies 
we discount the reserve and its corresponding receivable to its respective estimated net present value using the risk free rates associated with the actuarially determined weighted average lives of our excess claims 
when appropriate  based on our best estimate  we record a valuation allowance against the insurance receivable to reflect amounts that may not be realized 
there are two main factors that impact workers compensation expense the number of claims and the cost per claim 
the number of claims is driven by the volume of hours worked  the business mix which reflects the type of work performed  and the safety of the environment where the work is performed 
the cost per claim is driven primarily by the severity of the injury  the state in which the injury occurs  related medical costs  and lost time wage costs 
a increase in the cost of claims incurred would result in an increase to workers compensation expense of million 
we have not had significant changes in the assumptions used in calculating our reserve balance 
however  our reserve balances have been positively impacted primarily by the success of our accident prevention programs 
in the event that we are not able to further reduce our accident rates  the positive impacts to our reserve balance will diminish 
stock based compensation under various plans  officers  employees and non employee directors have received or may receive grants of stock  restricted stock awards  performance share units or options to purchase common stock 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan espp 
compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  based on the stock s fair market value on the grant date 
for restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions  compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche 
we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest  rather than record forfeitures when they occur 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in the future periods 
we determine the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
we recognize expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and record adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates 
based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term  management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal would not have been material 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical write off experience  expectations of future write offs and current economic data and represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and past due balances are written off when it is probable the receivable will not be collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations 
we allocated goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting units that are expected to benefit from the business combination 
we do not amortize goodwill but test it for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter  or when indications of potential impairment exist 
we monitor the existence of potential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
we consider our brands labor ready  spartan staffing  clp resources  planetechs and centerline to be reporting units for goodwill impairment testing 
in fiscal  and  there were no material changes to our reporting units 
the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
fair value reflects the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit 
if the fair value exceeds carrying value  then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is required to measure possible goodwill impairment loss 
the second step includes hypothetically valuing the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
then  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess  not to exceed the carrying value 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit primarily using a discounted cash flow model 
based on our test  the fair market value of our reporting units was substantially greater than net carrying value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes on each reporting unit 
critical assumptions include projected revenue growth  gross profit rates  selling  general and administrative expense rates  working capital fluctuations  capital expenditures and terminal growth rates  as well as an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
discount rates are determined using the capital asset pricing model 
we also use comparable market earnings multiple data and our company s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations 
we base fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
we have indefinite lived intangible assets related to our clp resources and spartan staffing trade names 
we test our trade names annually for impairment  or when indications of potential impairment exist 
we utilize the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of each of our trade names 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess 
considerable management judgment is necessary to determine key assumptions  including projected revenue  royalty rates and appropriate discount rates 
an impairment assessment of physical assets is necessary whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
in such cases  the asset must be written down to the greater of the net realizable value or fair market value 
reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities from time to time we are subject to compliance audits by federal  state  and local authorities relating to a variety of regulations including wage and hour laws  taxes  workers compensation  immigration  and safety 
from time to time we are also subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of our operations 
we have established reserves for contingent legal and regulatory liabilities 
we record a liability when our management judges that it is probable that a legal claim will result in an adverse outcome and the amount of liability can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent that an insurance company is contractually obligated to reimburse us for a liability  we record a receivable for the amount of the probable reimbursement 
we evaluate our reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
income taxes and related valuation allowances we account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon the provisions of tax law as currently enacted  the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
future tax law changes  such as changes to federal and state corporate tax rates and the mix of states and their taxable income  could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
when appropriate  we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate  we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  based in part upon management s judgments regarding future events and past operating results

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  each of which could adversely affect the value of our investments 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
in march   we entered into an agreement with chartis and the bank of new york mellon creating a trust which holds the majority of our collateral obligations under existing workers compensation insurance policies previously held by chartis 
the trust now holds a significant portion of our total restricted cash and investments  much of which is invested in high quality debt instruments 
as a result of the shift in our restricted cash and investments portfolio  we are exposed to risk from interest rates and credit exposure 
we mitigate these risks through investment policy directives for the trust  with the first priority to be the preservation of capital  and second to maintain and ensure a high degree of liquidity 
the investments are broadly diversified among high quality investments in us treasury securities  us agency debentures  us agency mortgages  corporate securities  and municipal securities 
the individual investments within the trust are subject to credit risk due to possible rating changes  default or impairment 
we monitor the portfolio to ensure this risk does not exceed prudent levels 
we consistently apply and adhere to our investment policy of holding high quality  diversified securities 
we have the positive intent and ability to hold all investments until maturity and accordingly all our investments are classified as held to maturity 
any fluctuation or change in interest rates would not impact our net income 
furthermore  an increase or decrease in interest rates immediately and uniformly by would not have a material effect on our restricted cash and investments or cash and cash equivalents balances 
we have a certain amount of assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to our international operations 
we have not hedged our foreign currency translation risk and we have the ability to hold our foreign currency denominated assets indefinitely and do not expect that a sudden or significant change in foreign exchange rates will have a material impact on future operating results or cash flows
