item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an integrated producer of high performance advanced engineered materials used in a variety of electrical  electronic  thermal and structural applications 
our products are sold into numerous markets  including consumer electronics  industrial components and commercial aerospace  defense and science  energy  medical  automotive electronics  telecommunications infrastructure and appliance 
sales were billion in  a increase over and a record high 
the sales growth was mainly due to higher metal pass through prices  improved pricing in portions of our business and stronger demand from certain markets  including industrial components and commercial aerospace  energy  automotive electronics and medical 
however  demand from the consumer electronics market  which was strong in the first half of  weakened in the second half of the year while defense sales were relatively flat and our overall sales and order entry rate slowed down in the fourth quarter of the year 
gross margin of million in was million lower than in as the benefits from the higher sales volume were more than offset by the ongoing costs associated with the start up of our new beryllium facility  inventory valuation differences and other manufacturing issues 
we generated an operating profit of million in compared to an operating profit of million in in addition to the lower gross margin  operating profit in was adversely affected by higher expenses  including an increase in consignment fees largely due to higher metal market prices and an increase in research and development expenses caused by higher activity levels 
legal  administrative and marketing expenses also increased in due to the successful completion of the rebranding of our company under the materion name 
this program was designed to improve the coordination and effectiveness of our marketing efforts and improve our profitability over the long term 
we incurred additional expenses in as a result of our acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of eis optics limited eis for million in cash in the fourth quarter eis produces optical filters and related materials at its manufacturing operations in china 
the acquisition expanded the market breadth of our precision optics product line and was consistent with our overall strategy to acquire niche operations for our advanced material business 
as part of that strategy  we had previously acquired barr associates  inc barr in the fourth quarter followed closely by our acquisition of academy corporation academy in the first quarter our effective tax rate was lower in than in due to differences in a number of credits and adjustments  which offset a portion of the impact of the decreased operating profit on net income 
diluted earnings per share were in and in cash flow from operations was a strong million in  an improvement from the cash flow from operations of million generated in this cash flow was sufficient to fund capital expenditures  the acquisition of eis and a net reduction in debt during the year 
the debt to debt plus equity ratio was at year end compared to at year end various debt and metal consignment agreements were renegotiated during resulting in expanded capacity and more flexible terms 
with the favorable resolution of two chronic beryllium disease lawsuits in the first quarter  there were no beryllium disease claims pending against us as of year end 
table of contents results of operations millions except per share amounts net sales operating profit loss income loss before income taxes net income loss diluted earnings per share sales of billion were million  or  higher than sales of billion in order entry rates started off fairly strong but weakened in the second half of the year and in the fourth quarter in particular 
the order entry rate was lower in the second half of than in the first half of the year 
the total order entry level in  while higher than the order entry in  was approximately lower than sales in sales in were million  or  higher than sales of million in demand from the majority of our key markets improved in over and overall demand remained strong throughout as order entry levels exceeded sales in each quarter of consumer electronics is our largest market and accounted for of our total sales in while sales to this market grew approximately in over  this growth was mainly due to higher metal pass through prices 
excluding the metal price difference  consumer electronics sales declined as sales softened in the second half of due to downstream inventory reductions and other factors 
consumer electronics sales increased significantly in over as a result of an increase in consumer spending due to the improved economic conditions as well as the development of new applications that utilize our materials  including smart phones and leds 
defense and science market sales  which were of our total sales in  were relatively unchanged in as compared to our traditional beryllium based defense business softened in the second half of the year due to government spending delays and push outs 
demand for precision optics for defense and science applications also slowed down in this softness was offset by mild growth in defense applications from other portions of the business 
defense and science sales grew in over as a result of improved demand for beryllium based applications as well as inclusion of a full year of barr s sales 
sales to the industrial components and commercial aerospace market were of our total sales in and contributed to the growth in sales in each of the last two years 
sales of x ray windows for industrial applications have grown over the last two years 
commercial aerospace sales also have improved as have sales of materials for heavy equipment and other industrial applications 
energy market sales  which accounted for approximately of our total sales in  grew at a double digit rate in over largely due to strengthening demand for our traditional oil and gas materials 
materials for solar energy  fuel cells and other alternative energy applications contributed to the growth in as did architectural glass applications 
automotive electronics sales also grew at a double digit rate in over after nearly doubling in over demand in the domestic and european markets has remained solid over the past two years 
automotive electronics sales were approximately of total sales in both and sales to the medical market improved in over after being relatively unchanged in from in  we temporarily lost sales to a key medical application customer as a result of lower manufacturing yields 
process improvements were implemented and shipments to the customer resumed in market and product development efforts also led to improved sales to other customers in the medical market in medical market sales were of our total sales in 
table of contents the acquisition of eis in the fourth quarter had a minor impact on our sales in  while the acquisitions of barr and academy accounted for of the sales growth in over a large portion of academy s sales is a precious metal pass through 
sales are affected by metal prices as changes in precious metal and a portion of the changes in base metal prices  primarily copper  are passed on to our customers 
metal prices have been quite volatile over the last three years  with various metals reaching near term or all time record highs during this time period 
the average copper prices for and were higher than the respective prior year 
gold and other precious metal prices were also higher on average in and than the immediate prior year  although prices softened in the fourth quarter the net change in metal prices resulted in an estimated million increase in sales in over and an estimated million increase in sales in over domestic sales were higher in over while domestic sales in were slightly more than double the level 
domestic sales include the majority of the impact of the higher metal price pass through between periods 
the growth in over was also due to the addition of barr and academy 
international sales  which are included in each of our reportable segments  increased in from after improving in over gross margin was million and of sales in compared to million and of sales in in  gross margin was million and of sales 
differences in the volumes sold by the four segments between and resulted in a net increase of million in gross margin in the change in product mix  however  was unfavorable partially due to the lower sales of higher margin generating traditional beryllium products for defense applications and strip products to the consumer electronics market in compared to improved pricing in portions of our business provided a margin benefit in we continued working on the installation and start up of our new beryllium facility during at the elmore  ohio plant site 
we incurred additional operating and material costs and generated manufacturing inefficiencies as a result of the delayed start up of the facility totaling an estimated million in the gross margin in was also reduced as a result of net unfavorable inventory valuation adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter within the advanced material technologies segment of million 
higher scrap rates on certain nickel based products reduced margins by approximately million in as compared to progress was made on improving yields and reducing scrap on these products during the fourth quarter we recorded a million benefit to gross margin in as a result of the depletion of a last in  first out lifo inventory layer 
there was no corresponding benefit recorded in or we estimate that the incremental margin generated by the higher sales volumes  including the sales from barr and academy  accounted for approximately of the gross margin improvement in over manufacturing efficiencies  in part due to the increased production levels  and cost control efforts also contributed to the margin growth in factory labor  other direct manufacturing costs and manufacturing overhead costs did not increase proportionately with the increase in sales in the overall change in product mix was favorable between and  while pricing improvements were made in portions of our business 
yield losses and other inventory valuation adjustments at certain operations had a minor negative impact on overall margins in we implemented various cost saving initiatives beginning in the fourth quarter and during in response to the weakening order entry rate at that time 
these initiatives included a reduction in work force  
table of contents reduced wage and compensation levels  elimination of overtime and a reduction in regular work hours in some cases  reduced discretionary spending and the cancellation or deferral of various projects and initiatives 
these efforts helped to offset the negative margin and profit impact of the lower sales volume in with the improved sales volumes subsequent to  wage levels were restored and various resources  including manpower and services  were added back as needed to support the current and projected volumes 
however  the total employment level  excluding the impact of the acquisitions  at year end and was still lower than the third quarter employment level which was just prior to when the global economic crisis began to significantly impact our business 
the annual expense on the domestic defined benefit pension plan was million in  million in and million in which included a one time curtailment gain due to the reduction in the workforce in that year 
the increase in the pension expense in over was due to a change in the discount rate  the performance of the plan assets and other factors and affected cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and  to a lesser extent  research and development expenses 
see critical accounting policies 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in legal  administrative and marketing expenses associated with the change of our name to materion corporation in the first quarter totaled million in costs associated with this program totaled million in the incentive compensation expense on plans that pay in cash was million lower in than and million higher in than in the changes in the annual expense between years were caused primarily by the performance of the individual operations relative to their plans objectives 
stock based compensation expense  including the expense for stock appreciation rights  restricted stock and performance restricted shares  was million in  million in and million in the comparison of stock based compensation expense between years may be affected by changes in plan design  the number of grants in a given year  actual performance relative to the plans objectives  movement in our stock price  forfeitures  vesting schedules and other factors 
acquisition related expenses for legal  accounting and due diligence services associated with the eis  academy and barr transactions totaled million in  million in and million in as a result of a change in accounting regulations effective january   acquisition related expenses must be charged against income as incurred 
previously  these expenses would have been capitalized as part of the cost of the acquisitions 
expenses incurred by eis subsequent to its acquisition totaled million and contributed to the increase in sg a expenses in approximately of the increase in sg a expenses in over was due to the expenses incurred by barr and academy subsequent to their acquisition 
severance and related costs associated with headcount reductions totaled approximately million in  million in and million in commissions and various other sales related expenses were higher in than in with the significantly improved sales volumes in over  a portion of the previously reduced selling and administrative resources were added back during to support the current and projected growth in the business 
corporate information technology expenses were million higher in than in due to an increase in the number of projects and to support the growth in the organization 
corporate environmental  health 
table of contents and safety expenses increased million in over due to various studies undertaken 
other corporate administrative expenses  including legal compliance costs and the costs of initiatives designed to improve efficiencies and profitability over the long term  were higher in than in other corporate expenses were also higher in than in research and development r d expenses were million in  million in and million in while r d expenses increased million in  the expense was less than of sales in each of the last three years 
the higher expense in was due to an increase in activity levels and various special projects 
r d efforts are focused on developing new products and applications as well as continuing improvements in our existing products 
derivative ineffectiveness expense was million in and million in there was no derivative ineffectiveness recorded in we secured a copper derivative embedded in a debt obligation in that served as an economic hedge to changes in the value of our copper inventories 
however  the derivative did not qualify as a hedge for accounting purposes and changes in its fair value were recorded against income as ineffectiveness expense 
the derivative was in a loss position of million as of year end as a result of an increase in the market price of copper since the derivative s inception 
forward contracts were secured in to hedge against further unfavorable changes in the embedded derivative s fair value 
the million of expense in was the net unfavorable change in the fair value of these instruments in the embedded derivative and forward contracts matured during other net expense was million in  million in and million in see note n to the consolidated financial statements for the details of the major components of other net expense for each of the three years 
the major differences in other net expense between the years include the following the metal consignment fee increased million in over and million in over as a result of higher metal prices  increased quantities of metal on hand and the inclusion of academy s requirements under the consignment lines beginning in the barr purchase agreement included an earn out feature that would require us to make additional payments to the prior owners of barr based upon barr s performance against identified benchmarks over the to period 
the present value of the earn out was estimated to be million at the time of the acquisition and was recorded in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  no payments were required to be made in either or based upon barr s actual performance relative to the individual benchmarks for those two years 
we determined that the fair value of this liability  based upon the current facts and circumstances and updated projections  should be reduced to zero as of december  we had previously reduced the fair value of the liability to million as of december  based upon a review of the facts and circumstances at that time 
the million benefit from the reduction to the liability in the fourth quarter and the million benefit from the liability reduction taken in the fourth quarter were recorded as income in those respective periods in accordance with accounting guidelines 
other net in includes a million benefit from the favorable resolution of a lawsuit that we had filed against a utility provider for raising our billing rates in violation of our contract 
in the fourth quarter  the court ruled in our favor and we received million in full satisfaction of our claim 
foreign currency exchange and translation losses totaled million in  million in and million in these losses result from movements in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies  primarily the euro and yen  and the related impact on certain foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities and transactions and the maturity of foreign currency hedge contracts 
we donated our former headquarters building and the associated land to a non profit organization  which resulted in a write off of the carrying value of million to other net expense in the majority of this unfavorable impact on income before income taxes was offset by a favorable income tax adjustment in that year 

table of contents operating profit was million in  a decline of million from the operating profit of million generated in the decline resulted from the margin benefit from changes in the sales volume being more than offset by the additional plant start up costs  other margin issues  higher sg a expenses  an increase in metal consignment fees and other factors 
operating profit in was a million improvement over the million operating loss in this improvement was due to the higher margin generated by the increased sales volumes  the favorable impact of the acquisitions and other factors offset in part by an increase in incentive compensation  metal consignment fees  amortization and other expenses 
interest expense net was million in  million in and million in the average outstanding debt levels were similar in and  while the average effective borrowing rate was slightly higher in than in  particularly in the second half of the difference in interest capitalized in association with capital projects between periods was negligible 
the average outstanding debt levels were higher throughout than primarily as a result of the barr and academy acquisitions and the increase in working capital 
capital lease balances were higher in than as well 
the impact of the higher debt and capital lease levels on interest expense was partially offset by a lower effective borrowing rate in than income loss before income taxes and income tax expense benefit for each of the past three years were as follows dollars in millions income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit effective tax benefit rate the effects of percentage depletion a tax benefit resulting from our mining operations  foreign source income and deductions  the production deduction  discrete events and other items were major causes of the differences between the effective and statutory rates in each of the three years 
the effect of executive compensation was also a cause for the difference between the effective and statutory rates in and  while the research and experimentation credit provided a benefit in the tax expense in included net favorable discrete items of million due to a combination of a reduction to the tax reserves as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations  adjustments to the tax returns that were finalized in the third quarter and other items 
the tax expense in included million for the reduction of a deferred tax asset as a result of the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act 
beginning in  we will no longer be able to claim an income tax deduction for prescription drug benefits provided to our retirees and reimbursed under the medicare part d retiree drug subsidy program 
while this tax increase does not take effect until  accounting standards require that the carrying value of a deferred tax asset be adjusted in the period in which legislation changing the applicable tax law is enacted 
the tax expense also included the unfavorable impact of a net million increase in the tax reserves that was recorded in accordance with accounting guidelines 
in  the tax benefit was increased by a net million reduction in the tax reserves 
see note p to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the statutory and effective tax rates 

table of contents net income was million  or per share diluted  in versus million  or per share diluted  in in  the net loss was million  or per share diluted 
segment disclosures in the first quarter  we changed the name of our company from brush engineered materials inc to materion corporation 
the names of all of our active subsidiaries changed as well and each subsidiary now has materion as part of its name 
the legal and ownership structure of our subsidiaries remained unchanged 
this name change did not alter our senior management structure or how the chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our businesses 
we continue to have the same four reportable segments as we had previously with no change in their make up  although the names of those segments have changed 
advanced material technologies and services has been revised to advanced material technologies  specialty engineered alloys is now known as performance alloys  beryllium and beryllium composites has been shortened to beryllium and composites  and engineered material systems has been changed to technical materials 
results by segment are shown in note m to the consolidated financial statements 
the all other column in note m includes our parent company expenses  other corporate charges and the operating results of materion services inc  a wholly owned subsidiary that provides administrative and financial oversight services to our other businesses on a cost plus basis 
the all other column shows an operating loss of million in  million in and million in the primary difference between the and results was due to the costs associated with the company name change  due diligence and acquisition costs  various corporate initiatives and other factors offset in part by lower incentive compensation and an increase in costs charged out to the business units 
the loss in all other was lower in than in as an increase in corporate spending and higher incentive compensation expense were more than offset by an increase in charges out to the business units and the difference in derivative ineffectiveness between periods 
advanced material technologies millions net sales operating profit advanced material technologies manufactures precious  non precious and specialty metal products  including vapor deposition targets  frame lid assemblies  clad and precious metal preforms  high temperature braze materials  ultra fine wire  advanced chemicals  optics  performance coatings and microelectronic packages 
these products are used in wireless  semiconductor  photonic  hybrid and other microelectronic applications within the consumer electronics and telecommunications infrastructure markets 
other key markets for these products include medical  defense and science  energy and industrial components 
advanced material technologies also has metal cleaning operations and in house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customers scrap 
this segment has domestic facilities in new york  connecticut  wisconsin  new mexico  massachusetts and california and international facilities in asia and europe 
sales from advanced material technologies were billion in  an improvement of million  or  over sales of million in sales in were million  or  higher than sales of million in the sales growth in both years was due to a combination of higher precious metal prices  improved demand from certain markets and product and market development efforts 
the acquisitions of barr and academy accounted for approximately of the sales growth in over while the eis acquisition had a minor impact on the sales growth 

table of contents we adjust our selling prices daily to reflect the current cost of the precious and various non precious metals sold 
while a change in the cost of the metal is generally a pass through to the customer  we generate a margin on our fabrication efforts irrespective of the type of metal used in a given application 
on average  the applicable metal prices were higher in and than the respective prior years 
we estimate that the higher metal price pass through increased sales by million in over while the metal price impact was greater than the total sales increase  underlying volumes processed grew in due to differences in product mix  customer supplied metal and other factors 
higher metal prices accounted for an estimated million of the increase in sales in over sales of vapor deposition targets  lids  wire and other related precious and non precious metal products for microelectronic applications grew significantly during over  but the majority of this growth was due to the pass through of higher metal prices 
sales of these materials to the consumer electronics market for led  wireless and other handheld device applications  while higher in than in  slowed down in the second half of as demand was stagnant 
strong demand for these applications was a key driver in the growth of advanced material technologies sales in over refining revenue grew in and over the immediate prior year in part due to the expansion of our operations  the acquisition of academy and increased marketing efforts 
refining revenue is also partially a function of the volume of precious metal products sold and the available quantity of metal in the market to be reclaimed 
sales of advanced chemicals for led  optics  security  photovoltaic and other applications from the wisconsin operations grew approximately in over after growing in over the majority of this growth was due to the expanded use of led technologies and the development of new applications 
however  the growth rate slowed down in the second half of due to downstream inventory corrections and other factors 
advanced chemical sales for architectural glass applications within the energy market  which are produced through academy s new mexico operations  grew at a double digit rate in over sales of large area coatings  primarily precision precious metal coated polymer films  improved approximately in over after adjusting for the estimated metal price difference 
sales of these products declined approximately in from these products are sold primarily into the medical market 
lower manufacturing yields and the inability to hold tolerances resulted in missed sales to a key customer and the loss of a portion of the business to our competitor in new processes were developed and qualified with the customer and shipment levels improved during the sales growth in was also due to product development and share gains with other customers 
large area coatings continued its development work on solar energy and other potential new applications during precision optics sales were slightly higher in than in mainly as a result of the acquisition of eis in the fourth quarter optics sales from barr for the defense and science market declined in from due to changes in government spending patterns and budget cutbacks 
sales of precision optics to the medical and other markets improved slightly in over precision optics sales in were higher than due to the inclusion of a full year of barr s results 
sales of electronic packages  one of this segment s smaller product lines  declined approximately in from mainly due to changes in technology which were anticipated coming into within the telecommunications infrastructure market 
sales of electronic packages had grown in over sales for data storage applications  primarily magnetic head materials  had increased in over but softened in back to a similar level as order entry for the advanced material technologies segment was approximately lower than sales in in  order entry exceeded sales by approximately 

table of contents gross margins on advanced material technologies sales were million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in the net change in volume and product mix shift provided a benefit to gross margin in this was evident in the increased sales to the medical market and sales of various advanced chemical products  which typically generate higher margins 
these benefits were more than offset by higher manufacturing overhead costs  including the costs totaling million incurred by eis  and other factors  which included a net unfavorable inventory valuation adjustment of million that was recorded in the fourth quarter as a result of the reconciliation of the amount of metal on hand with amounts financed 
as a result of this inventory loss  we implemented additional control and reconciliation procedures in the first quarter the gross margin as a percent of sales was lower in than in in part due to the significant increase in the metal price pass through in sales 
the main cause for the million increase in gross margin in over was the margin benefit from the higher sales volume from the existing operations as well as from the two acquisitions 
this margin benefit was partially offset by the incremental manufacturing overhead costs incurred by barr and academy totaling million and the increased manufacturing overhead costs incurred by the existing operations of million 
the margin was adversely affected by the decline in the higher margin medical market sales 
approximately of academy s sales in were silver investment bars that generate very low margins 
these negative mix effects were generally offset by efficiencies and improvements in other areas 
gross margin as a percent of sales declined in from largely due to the higher precious metal price pass through in sales in and the addition of academy s sales  which have a very high metal content 
sg a  r d and other net expenses for this segment totaled million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in precious metal consignment fees were million higher in than and million higher in than due to the additional quantities of metal on hand due to the production requirements and the inclusion of academy s requirements under those lines beginning in and higher metal prices 
the rate charged by the financial institutions was higher in than in as well 
amortization expense was million lower in than in and million higher in than in the increase in was largely due to the acquisitions of academy and barr 
incentive compensation expense was million lower in than in and million higher in than due to the difference in performance relative to the plans objectives 
corporate charges were million higher in than in and million higher in than r d costs increased in each of the last two years in order to support the growth in the business 
various sales related expenses increased in to support the higher volumes 
the expenses incurred by eis subsequent to its acquisition accounted for million of the increase in expenses in  while expenses incurred by academy and barr accounted for approximately of the increase in expenses in over operating profit from advanced material technologies was million in  a decline of million from the operating profit of million generated in the margin benefits from the changes in volumes and mix were more than offset by the fourth quarter inventory valuation adjustment  higher overhead costs and the increase in consignment fees and other expenses 

table of contents the operating profit in was a million improvement over the operating profit of million in this improvement was due to the margin benefit from the higher sales volumes and other factors offset in part by higher expenses 
the barr and academy acquisitions contributed to the improved profit in this segment in operating profit was of sales in  of sales in and of sales in performance alloys millions net sales operating profit loss performance alloys manufactures and sells three main product families strip products  the largest of the product families  include thin gauge precision strip and thin diameter rod and wire 
these copper and nickel alloys provide a combination of high conductivity  high reliability and formability for use as connectors  contacts  switches  relays and shielding 
major markets for strip products include consumer electronics  telecommunications infrastructure  automotive electronics  appliance and medical  bulk products are copper and nickel based alloys manufactured in plate  rod  bar  tube and other customized forms that  depending upon the application  may provide superior strength  corrosion or wear resistance  thermal conductivity or lubricity 
while the majority of bulk products contain beryllium  a growing portion of bulk products sales is from non beryllium containing alloys as a result of product diversification efforts 
applications for bulk products include oil and gas drilling components  bearings  bushings  welding rods  plastic mold tooling  and undersea telecommunications housing equipment  and  beryllium hydroxide is produced at our milling operations in utah from our bertrandite mine and purchased beryl ore 
the hydroxide is used primarily as a raw material input for strip and bulk products and  to a lesser extent  by the beryllium and composites segment 
strip and bulk products are manufactured at facilities in ohio and pennsylvania and are distributed internationally through a network of company owned service centers and outside distributors and agents 
sales from performance alloys grew from million in to million in sales in were million  or  higher than sales of million in the sales growth in both years was due to improved demand from key markets particularly in  higher metal pass through prices and other price increases 
the order entry rate was lower than sales in as order entry levels started the year strong but then slowed down in the second half of the year 
the slow down in the second half of the year was primarily for strip products 
this slow down was mainly due to lower demand from the consumer electronics market  performance alloys largest market 
sales to this market declined approximately in from  with the entire fall off occurring in the second half of the year 
consumer electronics sales had grown in over largely due to the use of our materials in smart phones  pdas and other hand held devices 
sales of strip products to the appliance market  a smaller market that is primarily in europe  were also lower in than in after growing approximately in over sales to a number of performance alloys other key markets  however  have grown in each of the two most recent years 
automotive electronics sales improved over in from due to solid demand in the us and europe after growing in over as sales in the first half of were weak 
sales to the energy market grew approximately in over largely due to the continued strong demand for oil and gas applications 
energy market sales grew in partially as an aftermath of the gulf oil disaster in that year as 
table of contents customers turned to our products due to their high performance characteristics 
sales to the industrial components and commercial aerospace market improved in and driven by increased demand for non beryllium containing alloys for heavy equipment and other applications  higher build rates for commercial aircraft that utilize our materials and other factors 
sales to the telecommunications infrastructure market increased approximately in over largely as a result of higher bulk product shipments for undersea telecommunications housings 
strip product volumes shipped declined in from volumes had increased in the first half of the year but then slowed down in the second half of the year 
strip volumes in grew over the low levels in bulk product volumes grew in over after growing in over total volumes were slightly lower in than in average selling prices for strip and bulk products were higher in than and higher in than in copper prices were also higher on average in and over the respective prior year and the increased copper price pass through accounted for an estimated million of the sales growth in and million of the sales growth in sales of hydroxide have grown in each of the last two years but remain relatively small at less than of sales in each of the past three years 
the gross margin earned on performance alloys sales totaled million in compared to million in gross margin was of sales in and of sales in gross margin was million and only of sales in largely due to the impact of the global economic crisis during that year 
the higher selling prices  changes in foreign exchange rates and other factors contributed to improved margins  but this benefit was largely offset by an unfavorable change in product mix  higher conversion cost in our extraction mill  additional manufacturing costs on nickel products  differences due to the depletion of a lifo layer in and higher overhead costs 
the weaker product mix in was due to a decline in shipments of higher beryllium containing strip products compared to these products generally generate higher margins 
the higher conversion costs at the utah extraction mill were primarily chemicals and other commodities used for converting the bertrandite ore into beryllium hydroxide 
lower yields and higher scrap rates resulted in additional rework on certain nickel containing products in these operating issues did not affect sales  but raised manufacturing costs and reduced gross margin by approximately million in the majority of the higher costs were incurred in the first nine months of the year as process improvements have been made 
the depletion of a lifo inventory layer resulted in a net benefit to gross margin of million in this benefit did not repeat in as no significant lifo layers were depleted nor was there a comparable benefit in the higher sales volume was the largest cause of the improved gross margin in  accounting for an estimated million of the increase 
production volumes were also higher in than in  which  combined with other factors  led to improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher machine utilization rates 
factory labor and other direct manufacturing costs  while higher in than in  did not increase proportionately with the volume increase  allowing us to leverage our production efforts 
higher selling prices for bulk and strip products also contributed to the margin increase in over as did a favorable change in the product mix 
manufacturing overhead costs increased million in over largely due to increases in maintenance and supply expenses offsetting a decline in utility expenses 

table of contents total sg a  r d and other net expenses were million in  a slight increase over the expense total of million in these expenses totaled million in these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in r d expenses increased a modest amount in over due to higher activity levels  while foreign currency exchange losses and corporate charges were also higher in than in these increases were largely offset by a reduction in the incentive compensation expense  due to differences in the performance levels against the plan targets between years  and the favorable resolution of the lawsuit filed against a utility provider over billing rates 
selling and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged in from sg a  r d and other net expenses in were slightly higher in both the domestic and international portions of the segment 
the increased expense in on a dollar basis was due to higher incentive compensation which resulted from the significantly improved operating results  higher commissions due to the increased sales and higher corporate costs 
these increases were offset in part by a net decline in all of the other expenses incurred by this segment as various cost reduction efforts implemented during the downturn remained in place throughout closing of the distribution center operation in the united kingdom in the fourth quarter also resulted in cost savings in performance alloys generated an operating profit of million in  unchanged from the operating profit generated in as the margin benefit from the higher sales was offset by the impact of the increased manufacturing cost of nickel products  the non recurring lifo inventory benefit recorded in and other factors 
the operating profit in was an improvement of million over the operating loss of million in the increase in operating profit in was due to the margin generated by the higher sales  manufacturing improvements and improved pricing partially offset by changes in expenses 
operating profit was of sales in and of sales in beryllium and composites millions net sales operating profit loss beryllium and composites manufactures beryllium based metals and metal matrix composites in rod  sheet  foil and a variety of customized forms at its facilities in ohio and california 
these materials are used in applications that require high stiffness and or low density and they tend to be premium priced due to their unique combination of properties 
this segment also manufactures beryllia ceramics produced at its arizona facility 
defense and science is the largest market for beryllium and composites  while other markets served include industrial components and commercial aerospace  medical  energy and telecommunications infrastructure 
products are also sold for acoustics and optical scanning applications 
sales from beryllium and composites were million in  lower than sales of million in  while sales in were an improvement of million  or  over sales of million in sales to the defense and science market  which account for about half of this segment s sales  declined approximately in from due to government funding delays and project push outs 
the majority of the improvement in beryllium and composites sales in over was due to higher shipments to the defense and science market 
industrial components and commercial aerospace market sales grew in and over the respective prior year as sales of x ray window assemblies for industrial applications have grown at a double digit rate in each of the last two years 
a portion of the growth in this market in was due to the development of new 
table of contents applications for albemet  a metal matrix composite  in semiconductor manufacturing and inspection equipment 
however  sales for this application softened in the third and fourth quarters of due to weakening conditions in the capital equipment markets 
sales of ceramic laser tubes for industrial applications also softened in partially due to the flooding in thailand and its impact on our customers operations 
sales of beryllium speaker domes for acoustic diaphragm assemblies grew modestly in and but remained relatively minor 
this is a niche application that may present potential growth opportunities for our materials 
sales for energy and other miscellaneous applications grew by minor amounts in over as well 
sales to the medical market  which represent less than of this segment s sales  declined approximately in from after growing in over beryllia ceramic sales for applications within the telecommunications infrastructure market also softened in after growing in beryllium and composites generated a gross margin of million of sales in and million of sales in as gross margin was million lower in compared to gross margin was million of sales in gross margin was reduced by an estimated million in due to additional costs and inefficiencies associated with the delay in the start up of the new beryllium facility at the elmore plant site 
while the major pieces of equipment have been installed  we incurred additional costs for supplies  maintenance and other items in order to enable the simultaneous operation of all of the equipment at full production volumes 
this cost also included additional amounts spent to purchase beryllium at higher prices in order to fill sales orders since the facility did not generate production level quantities of material as planned 
improvements were ongoing in the first quarter and we expect the facility to be operational in the first half of the change in product mix was unfavorable in as compared to as defense sales  which typically generate higher margins  were lower 
higher operating costs  particularly in the fourth quarter  reduced margins compared to and largely offset the benefit from the yield improvements made on welded products 
the lower sales volume in had a minor impact on the decline in margins in from lower production levels at the arizona facility also negatively impacted gross margin in manufacturing overhead costs were million higher in than in partially due to the additional ongoing overhead costs for the new facility in elmore 
overhead costs also increased at the fremont  california facility  primarily salaries and fringe benefits  in order to support the higher business levels there 
the gross margin improved by an estimated million in over as a result of the higher sales volume 
the change in product mix was favorable in as compared to  while manufacturing overhead costs were also lower in than in as we were able to leverage the existing cost base 
the difference in input materials  use of vendor scrap and reclamation efforts provided an estimated million net benefit in these margin benefits were partially offset by lower manufacturing yields on welded products that reduced margins by an estimated million in new processes were implemented and yields on these products improved in the second half of sg a  r d and other net expenses totaled million of sales in  million of sales in and million of sales in r d expenses were higher in than due to increased activity and various projects 
selling costs increased in over as did corporate charges while incentive compensation expense was lower 
differences in other non operating items contributed to the higher expense level in the main drivers for the increased expense level in were higher incentive compensation  due to the improved profitability  and higher corporate charges 
various sales and marketing support expenses  including commissions and travel  also increased in over 
table of contents beryllium and composites generated an operating loss of million in compared to an operating profit of million in this million decline in profitability was due to a reduction in gross margin caused by inefficiencies and additional costs resulting from the delay in the start up of the new beryllium facility  additional overhead costs and other factors  and higher sg a expenses 
operating profit in was an improvement of million over the operating profit of million generated in this improvement was due to the margin benefit from the higher sales and other factors offset in part by an increase in expenses 
operating profit was of sales in and of sales in technical materials millions net sales operating profit loss technical materials capabilities include clad inlay and overlay metals  precious and base metal electroplated systems  electron beam welded systems  contour profiled systems and solder coated metal systems 
these specialty strip metal products provide a variety of thermal  electrical or mechanical properties from a surface area or particular section of the material 
our cladding and plating capabilities allow for a precious metal or other base metals to be applied in continuous strip form only where it is needed  reducing the material cost to the customer as well as providing design flexibility and performance 
major applications for these products include connectors  contacts  power lead frames and semiconductors while the largest markets are automotive electronics and consumer electronics 
the energy and medical markets offer further growth opportunities 
technical materials products are manufactured at our rhode island facility 
sales from technical materials of million in were higher than sales of million in sales in were nearly double the sales of million in sales of inlay and selective plating products showed the most growth in over  while sales of all major product lines were higher in than in sales to the automotive electronics and the consumer electronics market improved in and over the respective prior year 
automotive electronics sales grew in over after more than doubling in over consumer electronics sales were higher in than and approximately higher in than in a portion of the growth in consumer electronics sales in was due to an increase in shipments of disk drive arm materials despite shipment levels being disrupted in the fourth quarter by flooding in thailand that affected the downstream supply chain 
sales of disk drive arm materials grew in over sales for solar energy  fuel cells and other alternative energy applications showed solid growth in and due to product and market development activities 
sales to the medical market also grew in each of the last two years 
the growth in sales in was partially due to higher prices and changes in product mix 
order entry for technical materials was approximately lower than sales in as the order entry rate slowed down during the third quarter of the year 
order entry exceeded sales by approximately in gross margin on sales from technical materials was million of sales in compared to million of sales in gross margin was million and of sales in the higher sales volume was the main cause for the million increase in gross margin in over manufacturing overhead costs increased due to higher utility costs  maintenance and other items  but this increase was largely offset by lower inventory provision adjustments 

table of contents the million increase in gross margin in over was largely due to the million growth in sales  while the associated higher production volumes helped generate improved manufacturing efficiencies as well 
factory labor and other direct manufacturing costs were added back in only as needed to meet the production schedule 
manufacturing overhead costs were million higher in than in various capital expenditures and other improvements implemented in recent years have resulted in a more flexible deployment of the work force that has generated operating efficiencies 
while employment levels increased during and  the total employment within technical materials was lower at year end than it was as of the end of the third quarter  which was when the global economic downturn began 
sg a  r d and other net expenses totaled million in  million in and million in these expenses were of sales in  of sales in and of sales in the slight increase in the dollar amount of these expenses in over was caused primarily by higher commissions  due to the higher level of sales  and increases in fringe benefits costs and corporate charges offset in part by lower bad debt expense 
higher selling and marketing costs  including manpower  commissions and travel expenses  were the main cause of the increase in over incentive compensation costs and corporate charges were million higher in than in other net expenses  including the metal consignment fee and other miscellaneous items  contributed to the higher expense level in as well 
technical materials generated an operating profit of million in  an improvement of million over the million of profit generated in in  this segment had an operating loss of million 
operating profit was of sales in and of sales in international sales and operations we operate in worldwide markets and our international customer base continues to expand geographically due to the development of various foreign nations economies and the relocation of us businesses overseas 
our international operations are designed to provide a cost effective method of capturing the growing overseas demand for our products over the long term 
in asia  we have strategically located our facilities in japan  singapore  china  korea  taiwan and the philippines 
in  we expanded our asian manufacturing base with the acquisition of eis 
our european facilities are in germany  the united kingdom  ireland and the czech republic 
these operations provide a combination of manufacturing  finishing operations  local sales support and distribution services 
we also augment our sales and distribution efforts with an established network of independent distributors and agents throughout the world 
the following table summarizes total international sales by region for the last three years dollars in millions asia europe rest of world total percent of total sales international sales include sales from international operations and direct exports from our us operations 
the international sales in the above chart are included in the individual segment sales previously discussed 

table of contents total international sales improved approximately in over sales to europe improved in in part due to stronger automotive electronics sales  while sales to asia softened partially due to the weaker sales to the consumer electronics market in the second half of the year 
the lower asian sales were net of the benefit from the addition of eis in the fourth quarter 
international sales grew million in over as demand improved from the majority of our key markets and from all regions 
sales to asia increased  while european sales improved in over consumer electronics  automotive electronics  appliance and telecommunications infrastructure are the larger international markets for our products 
our market share is smaller in overseas markets than it is domestically  but international markets  and asia in particular  may present greater long term growth opportunities 
sales from the european and certain asian operations are denominated in their local currencies 
exports from the us and the balance of the sales from the asian operations are typically denominated in us dollars 
local competition generally limits our ability to adjust selling prices upwards to compensate for short term unfavorable exchange rate movements 
we have a hedge program with the objective of minimizing the impact of fluctuating currency values on our consolidated operating profit 
see critical accounting policies below 
legal proceedings one of our subsidiaries  materion brush inc  is a defendant from time to time in proceedings in various state and federal courts brought by plaintiffs alleging that they have contracted chronic beryllium disease or other lung conditions as a result of exposure to beryllium 
plaintiffs in beryllium cases generally seek recovery under negligence and various other legal theories and seek compensatory and punitive damages  in many cases of an unspecified sum 
spouses  if any  often claim loss of consortium 
the following table summarizes the associated activity with beryllium cases 
december  total cases pending total plaintiffs including spouses number of claims plaintiffs filed during period ended number of claims plaintiffs settled during period ended aggregate cost of settlements during period ended dollars in thousands number of claims plaintiffs otherwise dismissed settlement payment and dismissal for a single case may not occur in the same period 
additional beryllium claims may arise 
management believes that we have substantial defenses in these types of cases and intends to contest the suits vigorously should they arise 
employee cases  in which plaintiffs have a high burden of proof  have historically involved relatively small losses to us 
third party plaintiffs typically employees of customers or contractors face a lower burden of proof than do employees or former employees  but these cases are generally covered by varying levels of insurance 
although it is not possible to predict the outcome of any litigation  we provide for costs related to these matters when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably in amounts exceeding our reserves 
an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
we are unable to estimate our potential exposure to unasserted claims 

table of contents based upon currently known facts and our experience with beryllium cases and assuming collectibility of insurance  we do not believe that resolution of future beryllium proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or cash flow 
however  our results of operations could be materially affected by unfavorable results in one or more of these cases 
the settlement payments of  made in and  made in were not reimbursed by insurance since our total applicable costs were less than the annual deductible in both years 
regulatory matters 
standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by the united states occupational safety and health administration osha and by other governmental and private standard setting organizations 
one result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards 
some organizations  such as the california occupational health and safety administration and the american conference of governmental industrial hygienists  have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of osha 
the development  proposal or adoption of more stringent standards may affect the buying decisions by the users of beryllium containing products 
if the standards are made more stringent and or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium containing products  our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards  the cost and ability to meet the new standards  the extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors 
the magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated 
financial position net cash provided from operations was million in as net income  the effects of depreciation and deferred taxes and a reduction in accounts receivable more than offset the net increase in other working capital items 
cash used in operations totaled million through the first three quarters of as a result of increases in receivables and inventory  contributions to the domestic pension plan  payment of the incentive compensation and changes in other items 
in the fourth quarter  however  a decline in receivables  coupled with other improvements  resulted in cash flow from operations of million in that period 
in  cash provided from operations totaled million as net income and the effects of depreciation  deferred taxes and other items more than offset increases in working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventory 
the majority of the working capital build in occurred in the first half of the year as sales levels ramped up from the low levels in in  we generated cash flow from operations of million as reductions in accounts receivable and inventory  the effects of depreciation and other items more than offset the net loss for the year 
as previously noted  changes in the cost of precious and base metals are essentially passed on to customers 
therefore  while sudden movements in the price of metals can cause a temporary imbalance in our cash receipts and payments in either direction  once prices stabilize our cash flow tends to stabilize as well 
working capital cash totaled million as of december   a decline of million from the cash balance of million as of year end the excess cash  coupled with the cash provided from operations  were used to finance the acquisition of eis  capital expenditures  a reduction in debt and the repurchase of shares 
cash increased million in over as the cash flow from operations  the increase in debt and proceeds from the exercise of stock options exceeded the cost to acquire academy and the capital expenditure funding requirements in 
table of contents accounts receivable of million at year end was million  or  lower than the accounts receivable balance of million as of year end the decline was due to a combination of changes in the sales volume  as sales in the fourth quarter were lower than sales in the fourth quarter  and an improvement in the average collection period from approximately days at year end to days at year end the receivable balance increased during the first three quarters of due to the higher sales volumes and then declined significantly in the fourth quarter the accounts receivable balance as of year end was a million  or  increase over the receivable balance of million as of year end the main driver for the increased receivable balance was the higher level of sales 
sales in the fourth quarter were million  or  higher than sales in the fourth quarter the days sales outstanding  a measure of how quickly receivables are collected  slowed by less than one day and had a minor impact on the increase in receivables in the expense for accounts written off to bad debts and changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts was only million in and million in we have procedures in place to closely monitor our accounts receivable aging and to follow up on past due accounts 
we evaluate the credit position of new customers in advance of the initial sale and we evaluate our existing customers credit positions on an ongoing basis 
we will revise credit terms offered to our customers as conditions warrant in order to minimize our exposures 
credit terms may vary by country based upon local customary practice and competition 
billings for precious metals tend to have tighter payment terms than billings for other products 
advance billings are used from time to time to help reduce credit exposures and speed up the collection of cash 
other receivables totaled million as of december  and million as of december  the majority of the amounts due at both year ends were for reimbursement for equipment purchased under a government contract 
these billings are typically paid by the government on a current basis 
inventories were million as of year end  an increase of million  or  over the inventory balance of million as of year end as the inventory turnover ratio  a measure of how efficiently inventory is utilized  slowed down 
inventories increased million  or  during as inventories had been drawn down significantly in due to the global economic impact on our business that year 
inventories at our utah extraction mill and mine increased million in over due to the cyclical nature of our mining operations and the planned timing of extracting ore and the deployment of our mining resources 
in  utah s inventories declined million as a portion of our resources were devoted to constructing a new pit during the majority of that year 
a significant portion of the increase in total inventories in both years was in performance alloys 
inventory pounds on hand were higher at year end than year end after growing during over year end this growth in pounds on hand was less than the growth in pounds shipped over the two year period 
advanced material technologies inventories grew approximately in after growing approximately in over a large portion of this segment s precious metal requirements are maintained on a consigned basis 
the acquisition of eis added million to the year end inventory  while the acquisition of academy in added million to the year end inventory 
technical materials inventory declined in despite the higher level of sales due to improved efficiencies 
inventories within technical materials had increased approximately in in order to support the increased business levels in that year 
inventories within beryllium and composites increased in in part due to the timing of external purchases of input material due to the start up issues with the new facility 
inventories had also increased in due to the higher sales volume and the timing of purchases of input materials in that year as well 

table of contents raw material prices  particularly prices for precious metals and copper  were volatile during and the overall average prices were higher in than in the impact of changing prices on our inventory value is minimized by the use of the lifo costing method within our domestic operations 
the lifo method results in the current cost being charged to the income statement and the older costs being used to value the inventory on hand 
see critical accounting policies below 
in addition  a portion of our metal requirements are maintained under off balance sheet consignment arrangements 
the metal is not purchased out of consignment until it is shipped to the customer 
intangible assets were million at year end compared to million at year end intangible assets increased approximately million during for deferred financing costs associated with new debt agreements and for the intangible assets acquired with eis  while amortization expense was million 
we acquired intangible assets totaling million during  including million acquired with academy 
amortization expense was million in see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued salaries and wages of million as of year end were million lower than the million balance as of year end accrued salaries and wages increased million in over the year end balance 
the differences in the balances between years were due to changes in the incentive compensation accruals  manpower levels  including the impact of the acquisitions  and other related factors 
other long term liabilities other long term liabilities totaled million as of december   a decrease of million from the million balance as of december  the decline was due to the reversal of the earn out liability associated with the barr acquisition as previously discussed  normal amortization of capital lease balances and other items 
other long term liabilities increased million during the predominant cause for this increase was the recording of the long term portion of a month  million capital lease for the building associated with the new beryllium facility being constructed at the elmore plant site 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in the estimated fair value of the earn out liability for the potential payments to be made to the sellers of barr 
retirement and post employment benefits the long term retirement and post employment benefit obligation was million as of december  compared to million at december  we have a defined benefit pension plan that covers the majority of our domestic employees 
the liability for this plan  which is included in the above totals  was million at year end and million as of year end the plan had a projected benefit obligation of million at year end  an increase from the projected benefit obligation of million at year end largely due to the current year expense and actuarial losses  including a reduction in the discount rate 
the market value of the plan assets was million at year end compared to million at year end this million increase for the year resulted from contributions of million less benefit payments and expenses of million and investment losses of million 
a portion of our domestic retirees and current employees are eligible to participate in a retiree medical benefit plan 
the liability for this unfunded plan was million as of december   with million classified as long term and million classified as short term  and million as of december   with million classified as long term and million classified as short term 
the plan expense was million in and million in 
table of contents our subsidiary in germany has an unfunded retirement plan for its employees  while our subsidiary in england has a funded retirement plan 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our retirement obligations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation  amortization and depletion expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in over was largely due to higher mine amortization that resulted from mining ore from the new pit opened late in the majority of the increase in over was due to the acquisitions of barr and academy and the additional depreciation and amortization on the assets acquired 
capital expenditures a summary of capital expenditures over the to timeframe is as follows millions capital expenditures mine development subtotal reimbursement for spending under government contract net spending we have a title iii contract with the us department of defense dod for the design and development of a new facility for the production of primary beryllium 
as previously noted  the equipment has been installed but work remains to bring it fully up on line and to operate at the designed and necessary levels of production 
the total cost of this multi year project is estimated to be million  with the dod providing approximately of the funding 
the final cost of the project and the dod s share will be determined based upon the satisfactory completion of the final construction items  resolution of any start up issues and other factors 
spending on this project totaled million in compared to million in and was included within the capital expenditure line in the above table 
reimbursements from the dod are recorded as unearned income  a liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion 
the spending and reimbursement received from the government may differ in a given year due to the normal lag between when the spending occurs and the government issues the reimbursement 
since  all of our metallic beryllium requirements have been supplied from materials purchased from the national defense stockpile and international vendors 
successful completion of this project will allow for the creation of the only domestic facility capable of producing primary beryllium 
advanced material technologies capital spending was million in compared to million in and million in spending in included an expansion to the refining and shield kit cleaning operations equipment at the buffalo  new york facility  the initial phase of an expansion to the singapore operations  new ventilation and safety equipment at the new mexico operations and a number of smaller projects throughout the segment 
capital spending by performance alloys  including mine development costs  totaled million in  million in and million in major projects in included a new dross reclamation system  upgrades to the casting operations and new rod  bar and tube processing equipment 
spending in also included million for the purchase of a building at the elmore  ohio facility that was previously held under an operating lease 
mine development costs were higher in due to the completion of a major new pit 
we began extracting ore from this pit in the fourth quarter performance alloys capital spending increased in over due to the improved profitability and cash flow in 
table of contents in addition to the new beryllium plant  capital spending within the beryllium and composites segment included spending on new machine shop equipment and other miscellaneous projects 
technical materials capital spending included upgrades to the electron beam welding equipment  modifications to other manufacturing equipment and various infrastructure projects 
we also continued work on software upgrades and implementations at various facilities during the to timeframe 
capacity expansion projects  including the new beryllium facility  accounted for approximately of the capital spending in  while new technology projects accounted for approximately of the spending 
the balance of the capital spending in was on maintenance capital projects and mine development 
acquisitions in addition to the above capital expenditures  we acquired the following businesses in the to time frame dollars in millions year cost acquired goodwill eis optics limited academy corporation barr associates  inc the eis goodwill and opening balance sheet valuations were preliminary as of year end as we were still assessing deferred taxes  the final adjustments to the purchase price in accordance with the terms of the purchase agreement and other items 
the academy acquisition cost is shown net of million we received back from the sellers in subsequent to the purchase as a result of the resolution of valuation adjustments in accordance with the purchase agreement 
each of these three acquisitions was financed with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the value of the assigned goodwill from each transaction was determined with the assistance of independent valuation experts 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
debt outstanding debt totaled million as of year end  a decline of million from the total debt of million outstanding as of december  debt increased million during the first three quarters of in order to fund  in part  the higher levels of working capital  the contributions to the domestic defined benefit pension plan and capital expenditures 
however  during the fourth quarter  despite the acquisition of eis  debt declined million largely due to a reduction in accounts receivable during that period 
short term debt totaled million as of year end  while long term debt was million 
the outstanding debt at year end was million higher than the balance of million as of december  the majority of this increase occurred in the first quarter as a result of funding a portion of the acquisition of academy and an increase in working capital 
short term debt totaled million while long term debt totaled million as of year end in the third quarter  we negotiated a new five year million revolving credit agreement to replace the former million revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to mature in the fourth quarter the new agreement provides for a committed revolving credit facility and is comprised of sub facilities for revolving loans  swing line loans  letters of credit and foreign currency denominated borrowings 
in addition to the higher borrowing capacity  various provisions relating to allowable unsecured debt  acquisitions and other items were revised in the new agreement to provide increased flexibility 
the key financial covenants in the new agreement  including a leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio  are similar to those contained in the former agreement 

table of contents in the second quarter  we entered into a new million debt agreement with the toledo lucas county port authority and the dayton montgomery county port authority to fund capital expenditures at our ohio facilities 
proceeds totaling million were used during  with the balance of the proceeds being held in escrow to be drawn down as the applicable capital expenditures are incurred 
the agreement calls for monthly installment payments and a million balloon payment upon maturity in ten years 
we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of december  shareholders equity shareholders equity was million as of year end  an increase of million over the balance of million as of year end equity also increased million in comprehensive income  which includes net income  changes in the cumulative translation adjustment  changes in the fair value of derivatives and adjustments to the carrying value of the pension and other post employment benefit liabilities that are charged directly to equity  was million in and million in we received million from the exercise of approximately  options in and million from the exercise of approximately  options in we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at a cost of million in under a share buyback program initially approved by the board of directors in the primary purpose of the buyback program is to offset a portion of the dilution caused by stock compensation plans 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million in under this program 
equity was also affected by stock based compensation expense  the tax benefits on stock compensation realization and other factors in both and off balance sheet obligations we maintain the majority of the precious metals we use in production on a consignment basis in order to reduce our exposure to metal price movements and to reduce our working capital investment 
in  we began consigning a portion of our copper requirements as well 
see item a of this form k 
the notional value of the off balance sheet inventory was million as of year end and million as of year end this increase was caused by a combination of higher metal prices and higher quantities of metal on hand 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the consignment agreements as of december  contractual obligations a summary of payments to be made under long term debt agreements  operating leases  significant capital leases  pension plan contributions and material purchase commitments by year is as follows millions there after total long term debt non cancelable lease payments capital lease payments pension plan contribution purchase commitments total 
table of contents the long term debt repayment in includes million borrowed under the revolving credit agreement as of year end while this agreement matures in  we anticipate that we will renegotiate a new agreement prior to the maturity date as we have done previously 
however  we cannot guarantee that a replacement facility will have similar terms as the existing facility 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements for additional debt information 
the non cancelable lease payments represent payments under operating leases with initial lease terms in excess of one year as of december  the capital lease payments include the building for the new beryllium facility at the elmore site and other material capital leases 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements for further leasing details 
the pension plan contribution of million in the above table represents our best estimate of the required contribution to the domestic defined benefit plan as of early contributions to the plan are designed to comply with erisa guidelines  which change from time to time  and are based upon the plan s funded ratio  which is affected by actuarial assumptions  investment performance  benefit payouts  plan expenses  amendments and other factors 
therefore  it is not practical to estimate contributions to the plan beyond one year 
contributions in excess of million may be made to the plan in the purchase commitments of million are for capital equipment to be acquired in based on orders placed with vendors as of december  liquidity we believe that cash flow from operations plus the available borrowing capacity and the current cash balance are adequate to support operating requirements  capital expenditures  projected pension plan contributions  environmental remediation projects and strategic acquisitions 
the cumulative cash flow provided from operations totaled million in through  while capital expenditures  net of amounts reimbursed by the government  totaled million 
the cash flow from operations includes contributions to the domestic pension plan of million during this three year period 
a summary of key data relative to our liquidity  including the outstanding debt  cash balances  available borrowing capacity and the debt to debt plus equity ratio  as of the end of each of the last three years is as follows december  dollars in millions total outstanding debt cash debt net of cash available borrowing capacity debt to debt plus equity ratio debt net of cash is a non gaap measure 
we are providing this information because we believe it is more indicative of our overall financial position 
it is also a measure our management uses to assess financing and other decisions 
debt net of cash increased million over the two year period from december  to december  during this time frame  we acquired academy for million and eis for million and we repurchased million of our common stock 
the increase in debt net of cash was less than these outlays due to the cash flow from operations exceeding capital spending 

table of contents our available borrowing capacity has increased over the last two years as a result of our improved operating performance and the renegotiated credit agreement 
the available borrowing capacity in the table above represents the additional amounts that could be borrowed under the revolving credit agreement and other secured lines existing as of december of each year depicted 
the applicable debt covenants have been taken into account when determining the available borrowing capacity  including the covenant that restricts the borrowing capacity to a multiple of the twelve month trailing earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and other adjustments 
the renegotiated revolving credit agreement provides a stable borrowing platform for the next five years with an expanded borrowing capacity and more favorable terms than the prior agreement 
the new debt agreement that funds capital expenditures in ohio also provided an additional source of capital in as of early in the first quarter  we do not know of any future or pending changes that will cause us to be in non compliance with any of our debt covenants in the near term 
as a result of the decline in debt and an increase in equity in  the debt to debt plus equity ratio  a measure of balance sheet leverage  improved from at year end to at year end we believe that our cash flow from operations can support this level of leverage over the long term 
the working capital ratio  which compares current assets excluding cash to current liabilities excluding debt  was to as of year end compared to to as of year end portions of our business utilize off balance sheet consignment arrangements to finance their metal requirements 
while the increasing metal prices over the last two years have put pressure on the consignment line limitations from time to time  we negotiated an increase to the available capacity under these arrangements during the available and unused capacity under the metal financing lines totaled approximately million as of december  cash on hand does not affect the covenants or the borrowing capacity under our debt agreements 
portions of the cash balances may be invested in high quality  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less 
in july  our board of directors re authorized the company to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which represent approximately of our outstanding shares 
the primary purpose of this program is to offset the dilution created through shares issued under stock based compensation plans 
any stock repurchases will be made from time to time for cash in the open market or otherwise  including without limitation  in privately negotiated transactions and round lot or block transactions on the new york stock exchange  and may be made pursuant to accelerated share repurchases or rule b plans 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
environmental we have an active environmental compliance program 
we estimate the probable cost of identified environmental remediation projects and establish reserves accordingly 
the environmental remediation reserve balance was million at december  and million at december  payments against the reserve totaled million in and million in see note j to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents ore reserves we have proven and probable reserves of beryllium bearing bertrandite ore in juab county  utah 
proven reserves are the measured quantities of ore commercially recoverable through the open pit method 
probable reserves are the estimated quantities of ore known to exist but have been computed from inspection sites that are farther apart than those used to measure proven reserves 
although the inspection sites are fewer  assurance levels are sufficient to assume ore continuity 
ore dilution of approximately seven percent occurs during the mining process 
the ore is processed at our extraction facility in utah 
approximately of the beryllium in ore is recovered in the extraction process 
we use computer models to estimate ore reserves  which are subject to economic and physical evaluation 
the requirement that reserves pass an economic test causes open pit mineable ore to be found in both proven and probable geologic settings 
proven reserves have decreased slightly in each of the last four years  while probable reserves have remained unchanged over the same time period 
based upon average production levels in recent years and our near term production forecasts  proven reserves would last over seventy five years 
the following table summarizes our proven and probable reserves and the quantity of ore processed over the last five years 
ore reserves classified as possible are excluded from the table 
proven bertrandite ore reserves at year end thousands of dry tons grade beryllium probable bertrandite ore reserves at year end thousands of dry tons grade beryllium bertrandite ore processed thousands of dry tons  diluted grade beryllium  diluted we own approximately of the proven reserves  with the remaining reserves leased 
we augment our proven reserves of bertrandite ore through the purchase of imported beryl ore from time to time 
this ore  which is approximately beryllium  is also processed at the utah facility 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the inherent use of estimates and management s judgment in establishing those estimates 
the following are the most significant accounting policies we use that rely upon management s judgment 
accrued liabilities 
we have various accruals on our balance sheet that are based in part upon management s judgment  including accruals for litigation  environmental remediation and workers compensation costs 
we establish accrual balances at the best estimate determined by a review of the available facts and trends by management and independent advisors and specialists as appropriate 
absent a best estimate  the accrual is established at the low end of the estimated reasonable range in accordance with accounting guidelines 
litigation and environmental accruals are established only for identified and or asserted claims  future claims  therefore  could give rise to increases to the accruals 
the accruals are adjusted as facts and circumstances change 
the accruals may also be adjusted for changes in our strategies or regulatory requirements 
since these accruals are estimates  the ultimate resolution may be greater or less than the established accrual balance for a variety of reasons  including court decisions  additional discovery  inflation levels  cost control efforts and resolution of similar cases 
changes to the accruals would then result in an additional charge or credit to income in the period when the change was made 
see note j to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents legal claims may be subject to partial or complete insurance recovery 
the accrued liability is recorded at the gross amount of the estimated cost and the insurance recoverable  if any  is recorded as an asset and is not netted against the liability 
the accrued legal liability includes the estimated indemnity cost only  if any  to resolve the claim through a settlement or court verdict 
the legal defense costs are not included in the accrual and are expensed in the period incurred  with the level of expense in a given year affected by the number and types of claims we are actively defending 
non employee claims for beryllium disease made prior to where any of the alleged exposure period is prior to year end are covered by insurance 
the insurance covers defense costs and indemnity payments resulting from settlements or court verdicts and is subject to a million annual deductible 
in  defense and indemnity costs were less than the deductible 
pensions 
we have a defined benefit pension plan that covers a large portion of our current and former domestic employees 
carrying values of the associated pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using numerous actuarial and financial assumptions 
differences between the assumptions and current period actual results are typically deferred into the net pension asset or liability value and amortized against future income under established guidelines 
the deferral process generally reduces the volatility of the recognized net pension asset or liability and current period income or expense 
unrealized gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income oci  a component of shareholders equity 
management annually reviews key pension plan assumptions  including the expected return on plan assets  the discount rate and the average wage rate increase  against actual results  trends  company strategies  the current and projected investment environment and industry standards and makes adjustments accordingly 
the actuaries adjust certain assumptions to reflect changes in demographics and other factors  including mortality rates and employee turnover  annually as warranted 
these adjustments may then lead to a higher or lower expense in future periods 
we establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality  fixed income investments whose maturities match the plan s projected cash flows 
an increase to the discount rate would reduce the present value of the projected benefit obligation and future pension expense and  conversely  a lower discount rate would raise the benefit obligation and future pension expense 
we elected to use a discount rate of as of december  and as of december  our pension plan investment strategies are governed by a policy adopted by the board of directors 
management uses a group of outside investment analysts and brokerage firms to implement these strategies 
the future return on pension assets is dependent upon the plan s asset allocation  which changes from time to time  and the performance of the underlying investments 
as a result of our review of various factors  we reduced the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption to as of december  from an assumption of as of december  the plan investments generated a loss of approximately in after generating gains of in and in the expected rate of return assumption relates to the long term and given changes in risk assumptions  projections of future returns by type of investment and other factors  we believe that a return over the long term is a reasonable assumption 
should the assets earn an average return less than over time  in all likelihood the future pension expense would increase 
investment earnings in excess of would tend to reduce the future expense 
the impact on the pension expense of a change in discount rate or expected rate of return assumption can vary from year to year depending upon the undiscounted liability level  the current discount rate  the asset balance  other changes to the plan and other factors 
if the december  discount rate were reduced by basis points and all other pension assumptions remained constant  then the projected pension expense would increase by approximately million 
if the expected rate of return assumption was reduced by basis points and all other pension assumptions remained constant  the projected pension expense would increase by approximately million 

table of contents based upon current assumptions  guidelines and estimates  we project the required cash contribution to be made to the plan will be million in additional contributions may be made during based upon a number of factors  including the performance of the plan investments  the plan s actual funded ratio  the discount rate environment  the company s operating performance  the availability of excess cash and borrowing rates under available credit lines 
the pension liability is recalculated at the measurement date december of each year and any adjustments to this account and oci will be recorded at that time accordingly 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our pension and other retirement plans 
lifo inventory 
the prices of certain major raw materials that we use  including copper  nickel  gold  silver and other precious metals  fluctuate during a given year 
overall prices on average were higher in than in where possible  such changes in material costs are generally reflected in selling price adjustments  particularly with precious metals and copper 
the prices of labor and other factors of production  including supplies and utilities  generally increase with inflation 
portions of these cost increases may be offset by manufacturing improvements and other efficiencies 
from time to time  we will revise our billing practices to include an energy surcharge in attempts to recover a portion of our higher energy costs from our customers 
however  market factors  alternative materials and competitive pricing may limit our ability to offset all cost increases with higher prices 
we use the lifo method for costing the majority of our domestic inventories 
under the lifo method  inflationary cost increases are charged against the current period cost of goods sold in order to more closely match the cost with the associated revenue 
the carrying value of the inventory is based upon older costs and  as a result  the lifo cost of the inventory on the balance sheet is typically  but not always  lower than it would be under most alternative costing methods 
the lifo cost may also be lower than the current replacement cost of the inventory 
the lifo inventory value tends to be less volatile during years of fluctuating costs than the inventory value would be using other costing methods 
the lifo impact on the income statement in any given year is dependent upon the inflation rate effect on raw material purchases and manufacturing conversion costs  the level of purchases in a given year and changes in the inventory mix and quantities 
assuming no change in the quantity or mix of inventory from the december  level  a basis point change in the annual inflation rate would cause a change of approximately million in the lifo inventory value 
deferred tax assets 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we review the expiration dates of the deferrals against projected income levels to determine if the deferral will or can be realized 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferral will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be established for that item 
certain deferrals do not have an expiration date 
we will also evaluate deferred tax assets for impairment due to cumulative operating losses and record a valuation allowance as warranted 
a valuation allowance may increase tax expense and reduce net income in the period it is recorded 
if a valuation allowance is no longer required  it will reduce tax expense and increase net income in the period that it is reversed 
we had valuation allowances of million associated with state and foreign deferred tax assets as of year end primarily for net operating loss carryforwards 
see note p to the consolidated financial statements for additional deferred tax details 
unearned revenue 
billings to customers in advance of the shipment of the goods are initially recorded as unearned revenue  which is a liability on the balance sheet 
this liability is subsequently reversed when the revenue is recognized 
revenue and the related cost of sales and gross margin are only recognized for these 
table of contents transactions when the goods are shipped  title passes to the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
the related inventory also remains on our balance sheet until these revenue recognition criteria are met 
advanced billings are typically made in association with products with long manufacturing times and or products paid with funds from a customer s contract with the government 
billings in advance of the shipments allow us to collect cash earlier than billing at the time of the shipment and  therefore  the collected cash can be used to help finance the underlying inventory 
the unearned revenue balance was million as of year end long term unearned income 
expenditures for capital equipment to be reimbursed under government contracts are initially recorded in construction in progress 
reimbursements for those expenditures are recorded in unearned income  a liability on the balance sheet 
the total cost of the assets to be constructed includes costs reimbursed by the government as well as costs borne by us 
when the assets are placed in service and capitalized  this total cost will be depreciated over the useful life of the assets 
the unearned income liability will be reduced and credited to income ratably with the annual depreciation expense 
this benefit in effect will reduce the net expense charged to the income statement to an amount equal to the depreciation on the portion of the cost of the assets borne by us 
capital expenditures subject to reimbursement from the government under the life of the current dod project and the related unearned income balance totaled million as of december  we anticipate that the associated equipment will be placed in service during derivatives 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency  commodity and precious metal price and interest rate exposures 
we apply hedge accounting when an effective hedge relationship can be documented and maintained 
the effective portion of the change in a cash flow hedge s fair value is recorded in oci until the underlying hedged item matures 
if a hedge does not qualify as effective  changes in its fair value are recorded against income in the current period 
if a derivative is deemed to be a hedge of the fair value of a balance sheet item  the change in the derivative s value will be recorded in income and will offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item to the extent that the hedge is effective 
we secure derivatives with the intention of hedging existing or forecasted transactions only and do not engage in speculative trading or holding derivatives for investment purposes 
our annual budget  quarterly forecasts  monthly estimates and other analyses serve as the basis for determining forecasted transactions 
the use of derivatives is governed by policies established by the board of directors 
these policies provide guidance on the allowable types of hedge contracts  the allowable duration of the contracts and other related matters 
hedge contracts are approved by senior financial managers at our corporate office 
the level of derivatives outstanding at a particular point in time may be limited by the availability of credit from financial institutions 
our practice has been to secure hedge contracts denominated in the same manner as the underlying exposure  for example  a yen exposure will only be hedged with a yen contract and not with a surrogate currency 
we also typically secure contracts through financial institutions that are already part of our bank group 
see note h to the consolidated financial statements and item a of this form k 
outlook while sales set a record in  the order entry rate slowed down in the fourth quarter largely due to softer demand from the consumer electronics market 
however  we believe that a portion of this softness may have been due to downstream inventory corrections as the decline in our order pattern was greater than the change in spending by the end use consumers and that our order level will improve as our customers will need to replenish their inventories in because of the performance characteristics of our materials  we are well positioned in the consumer electronics market and we serve a number of applications  including smart phones  various other handheld devices and leds  that have solid long term growth potential 

table of contents demand levels from various other markets remained solid in early  including the oil and gas and architectural glass sectors of the energy market  portions of our industrial markets and the automotive market 
our sales to the medical market improved in and we are anticipating that improvement to continue in new product development added to our sales in and we anticipate that this will continue in various markets  including solar and other alternative energy applications 
a full year of eis s results should have a minor positive impact on our sales in defense and science sales and orders have weakened due to pressures on government spending levels and it is difficult to project what future government budgets will entail 
we believe that the softness within our traditional beryllium based defense business is primarily due to push outs of orders as opposed to cancellations or lost applications while our defense customers within our optics business tend to be very uncertain about future funding levels and the related impact on various projects 
we are cautious about the state of the us economy and  in particular  the level of unemployment and government deficits and their related impact on consumer and industrial spending that could potentially affect our sales and costs 
we are also monitoring the current economic conditions in europe and the instability of their financial markets 
as of early in the first quarter  we are estimating that our sales in should be to higher than sales in raw material costs  primarily precious metals and copper  have been volatile but remain at fairly high levels 
while we typically pass these higher costs on to our customers  at these high levels  some customers may investigate alternative pricing and supply arrangements or may turn to alternative materials 
the higher precious metal and copper prices will also lead to higher consignment fees  which typically are not passed on to the customer 
our fringe benefit costs will increase in  primarily due to higher pension and other retirement plan costs as well as a result of medical cost inflation 
we believe our profit margins in should benefit from various costs incurred in not repeating to the same extent or at all in  including the rebranding of our company was completed in and while the legal and administrative costs associated with this project should not repeat in  a portion of the related advertising and marketing efforts will continue in order to fully leverage the rebranding efforts  the inefficiencies and other costs we incurred in to bring the new beryllium plant on line in should not continue at the same level in as we anticipate that the plant will become operational during the year  and the one time acquisition costs of million in should not repeat in unless we pursue other acquisitions 
the level of capital investment in will be somewhat dependent upon the actual and projected levels of profitability  cash flow from operations and borrowings levels 
as of early in the first quarter  we anticipate capital spending in to be similar to or slightly higher than the spending level in we also anticipate that we will begin construction of a new pit at our utah mining operations during the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to precious metal and commodity price  interest rate  foreign exchange rate and utility cost differences 
while the degree of exposure varies from year to year  our methods and policies designed to manage these exposures have remained fairly consistent over time 
generally  we attempt to minimize the effects of these 
table of contents exposures through the use of natural hedges  which include pricing strategies  borrowings denominated in the same terms as the exposed asset  off balance sheet arrangements and other methods 
where we cannot use a natural hedge  we may use derivative financial instruments to minimize the effects of these exposures when practical and cost efficient 
the use of derivatives is subject to policies approved by the board of directors with oversight provided by a group of senior financial managers at our corporate office 
we use gold and other precious metals in manufacturing various products 
to reduce the exposure to market price changes  the majority of our precious metal requirements are maintained on a consigned inventory basis 
we purchase the metal out of consignment from our suppliers when it is ready to ship to a customer as a finished product 
our purchase price forms the basis for the price charged to the customer for the precious metal content and  therefore  the current cost is matched to the selling price and the price exposure is minimized 
the use of precious metal consignment arrangements is governed by a policy approved by the board of directors 
we are charged a consignment fee by the financial institutions that own the precious metals 
this fee is partially a function of the market price of the metal 
because of market forces and competition  the fee can only be charged to customers in a limited case by case basis 
to further limit price and financing rate exposures  under some circumstances  we will require customers to furnish their own metal for processing 
customers may also elect to provide their own material for us to process as opposed to purchasing our material 
should the market price of precious metals that we have on consignment increase by from the prices on december   the additional pre tax cost to us as a result of an increase in the consignment fee would be approximately million on an annual basis 
this calculation assumes no changes in the quantity of inventory or the underlying fee and that none of the additional fees are charged to customers 
the available capacity of our existing credit lines to consign precious metals is a function of the quantity and price of the metals on hand 
as prices increase  a given quantity of metal will utilize a larger proportion of the existing credit lines 
a significant prolonged increase in metal prices could result in our credit lines being fully utilized  and  absent securing additional credit line capacity from a financial institution  could require us to purchase precious metals rather than consign them  require customers to supply their own metal and or force us to turn down additional business opportunities 
if we were in a significant precious metal ownership position  we might elect to use derivative financial instruments to hedge the potential price exposure 
the cost to finance and potentially hedge the purchased inventory may also be higher than the consignment fee 
the financial statement impact of the risk from rising metal prices impacting our credit availability cannot be estimated at the present time 
in certain circumstances  we may elect to fix the price of precious metal for a customer for a stated quantity over a specified period of time 
in those cases  we may secure hedge contracts whose terms match the terms in the agreement with our customer so that the gain or loss on the contract with the customer due to subsequent movements in the precious metal price will generally be offset by a gain or loss on the hedge contract 
at year end  we had hedge contracts to purchase and sell gold with a notional value of million 
a metal price decline of from the year end price would result in a net additional pre tax expense of approximately million in this calculation does not take into account the additional net gain that would be recorded on the underlying hedged transactions with the customer 
we also use copper in our production processes 
when possible  fluctuations in the purchase price of copper are passed on to customers in the form of price adders or reductions 
while over time our price exposure to copper is generally in balance  there can be a lag between the change in our cost and the pass through to our customers  resulting in higher or lower margins in a given period 
we consign a portion of our copper inventory requirements 
as with precious metals  the available capacity under the existing lines is a function of the quantity and price of metal on hand 
should the market cost of copper increase by from the price as of december   the additional pre tax cost to us as a result of an increase in the consignment fee would be approximately million on an annual basis 
this calculation assumes no changes in the quantity of inventory or the underlying fee and that none of the additional fees are charged to customers 

table of contents in our manufacturing processes  we use ruthenium and other base and precious metals that are not widely used by others or actively traded and  therefore  there is no established efficient market for derivative financial instruments that could be used to effectively hedge the related price exposures 
for certain applications  our pricing practice with respect to these metals is to establish the selling price based upon our cost to purchase the material  limiting our price exposure 
however  the inventory carrying value may be exposed to market fluctuations 
the inventory value is maintained at the lower of cost or market and if the market value were to drop below the carrying value  the inventory would have to be reduced accordingly and a charge taken against cost of sales 
this risk is mainly associated with long manufacturing lead time items and with sludges and scrap materials  which generally have longer processing times to be refined into a usable form for further manufacturing and are typically not covered by specific sales orders from customers 
we did not record any lower of cost or market charges in as a result of market price fluctuations while we recorded lower of cost or market charges totaling million in and million in we are exposed to changes in interest rates on portions of our debt and cash balances 
this interest rate exposure is managed by maintaining a combination of short term and long term debt and variable and fixed rate instruments 
we may also use interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on variable rate obligations  as we deem appropriate 
there were no interest rate derivatives outstanding as of december  excess cash is typically invested in high quality instruments that mature in ninety days or less 
investments are made in compliance with policies approved by the board of directors 
assuming no change in the amount or make up of the outstanding debt as of december   a basis point movement upwards in the interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by million 
portions of our international operations sell products priced in foreign currencies  mainly the euro and yen  while the majority of these products costs are incurred in us dollars 
we are exposed to currency movements in that if the us dollar strengthens  the translated value of the foreign currency sale and the resulting margin on that sale will be reduced 
we typically cannot increase the price of our products for short term exchange rate movements because of local competition 
to minimize this exposure  we may purchase foreign currency forward contracts  options and collars in compliance with board approved policies 
if the dollar strengthened  the decline in the translated value of our margins would be at least partially offset by a gain on the hedge contract 
a decrease in the value of the dollar would result in larger margins but potentially a loss on the contract  depending upon the method used to hedge the exposure 
we may also elect not to hedge of the forecasted exposure 
the notional value of the outstanding currency contracts was million as of december  if the dollar weakened against the currencies we have hedged from the december  exchange rates  the reduced gain and or increased loss on the outstanding contracts as of december  would reduce pre tax profits by approximately million in this calculation does not take into account the increase in margins as a result of translating foreign currency sales at the more favorable exchange rates  any changes in margins from potential volume fluctuations caused by currency movements or the translation effects on any other foreign currency denominated income statement or balance sheet item 
the fair value of the outstanding foreign currency contracts was a net asset of million at december   indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year end market exchange rates 
the cost of natural gas and electricity used in our operations may vary from year to year and from season to season 
we attempt to minimize these fluctuations and the exposure to higher costs by utilizing fixed price agreements of set durations  when deemed appropriate  obtaining competitive bidding between regional energy suppliers and other methods 
we are exposed to changes in global economic conditions and the potential impact those changes may have on various facets of our business 
we have a program in place to closely monitor the credit worthiness and financial condition of our key providers of financial services  including our bank group and insurance carriers  as well as the credit worthiness of customers and vendors and have various contingency plans in place 

table of contents our bank lines  including lines for credit  consignment and hedging  are with a bank group each of whom has remained solvent through the economic crisis in recent years 
overall  the capacity under our lines has increased in the last two years 
however  the financial statement impact from the risk of one or more of the banks in our bank group becoming insolvent cannot be estimated at the present time
