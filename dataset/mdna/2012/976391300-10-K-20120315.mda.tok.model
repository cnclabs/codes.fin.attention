overview as a diversified reit  we operate in three strategic segments i operating properties  ii loan assets  and iii reit securities

loan assets our investment strategy in focused heavily on our loan asset segment which we believed would generate the greatest overall return to us through interest payments as well as appreciation either through acquiring loan assets at a discount or acquiring loan assets with the expectation of a borrower default or recapitalization that will lead to an equity ownership interest
