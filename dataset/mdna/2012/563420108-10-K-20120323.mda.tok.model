recent economic conditions beginning in september of  the united states and world financial markets came under unprecedented stress 
the immediate impact was a dramatic decrease in liquidity and credit availability throughout the world 
an incredibly rapid and significant deterioration in economic conditions  especially in the united states and europe followed 
these events had an immediate significant adverse impact on the company 
in response to the events that occurred in late and  it was determined that swift management action was necessary to ensure that operating activity was balanced with current demand levels 
management actions included headcount reductions  reduction of overtime  suspension of additional hires and merit increases  reduction in executive and salaried pay  bonus and benefits and the introduction of shortened workweeks 
these actions  although difficult  were required to enable the company to adjust to current conditions and position it to respond quickly when the market recovers 
currently  the market for our products has stabilized and selective markets have grown  particularly the energy  and power distribution sectors domestically and in certain international markets 
our orders and revenues have shown marked improvement 
we are cautiously optimistic about the future 
however  there is still significant risk and uncertainty in the world markets  which could impact our future business 
our total backlog has increased steadily since december in response  we have taken and will continue to take actions to selectively increase production capacity  including hiring additional manufacturing employees at certain of our facilities 
factors affecting revenues and gross profit the company derives most of its revenue from purchase orders from dealers and distributors 
the demand for the company s products depends upon the general economic conditions of the markets in which the company 
table of contents competes 
the company s sales depend in part upon its customers replacement or repair cycles 
adverse economic conditions  including a decrease in commodity prices  may cause customers to forego or postpone new purchases in favor of repairing existing machinery 
additionally  our manitex liftking subsidiary revenues are impacted by the timing of orders received for military forklifts and residential housing starts 
cvs revenues are impacted in part by the timing of contract awards related to major port projects 
gross profit varies from period to period 
factors that affect gross profit include product mix  production levels and cost of raw materials 
margins tend to increase when production is skewed towards larger capacity cranes  special mission oriented vehicles  specialized carriers and heavy material transporters

the legal settlement at net present value referred to above was recorded as a result of the recent fifth circuit appeals court ruling reversing the earlier district courts ruling in the company s favor 
the amount recorded  represents the net present value of twenty annual payments of ninety five thousand dollars as provided for in a may  contingent settlement for two product liability suits related to an accident that occurred in under the settlement agreement  the company only becomes liable when it is ultimately determined that there is no duty on the part of the liability insurance carriers to defend the company 
this settlement is related to a liability for a product that was manufactured by a predecessor company of our manitex subsidiary 
the product liability of this predecessor company was assumed by various acquiring companies and ultimately became the company s liability when we acquired the company s manitex subsidiary in this settlement is of an unusual nature and although it had a significant impact on our results  it is not related to on going activities of the company

gross profit as a percent of sales was for the year ended december  for the year ended december   net revenue and gross profit were million and million  respectively 
gross profit as a percent of sales was for the year ended december  approximately half of the increase in revenues is attributed to increased revenues at cvs and naee  two units that commenced operations mid year the remaining increase in revenues is principally attributed to increased revenues for our boom trucks 
the increase in boom truck sales is largely due to strength in the energy and power distribution market segments  both domestically and in certain international markets 
a substantial portion of the significant decrease in military revenues at the liftking operation was offset by an increase in lower margin commercial business and by increased sales of load king specialized trailers 
gross profit as a percent of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period 
a modest improvement in the gross profit percent for crane products is attributed to a change in product mix towards high capacity cranes which have a higher gross profit margin and an increase in volume 
the decrease in the gross profit percent for other products is principally attributed to a decrease in higher margin military and governmental business  and the sales of used equipment which has a margin roughly half of that of our new product sales 
additionally  part sales which have significantly higher profit margins than unit sales decreased as a percent of total sales during  and was also a factor that contributed to the reduction in the gross margin percent 
increases in commodity prices  principally steel  is not a principal cause of the decrease in the gross margin percent 
nevertheless  the increase in commodity prices did have a modest negative impact on our gross profit percent 

table of contents restructuring expenses we began to experience the effects of the current economic recession in september of  which resulted in a dramatic curtailment of our new orders  requests to delay deliveries and  in some cases to cancellation of existing orders 
in response to these adverse economic conditions and longer sales cycles  management took action to balance its operations with decreased demand levels 
certain actions were implemented before december  significant additional steps were implemented shortly after year end and still other additional staff reductions occurred during the remainder of during  the company continued to monitor its staffing levels to insure that it was balanced with current demand levels 
as a result  additional layoffs were made to reduce our workforce in certain of our locations during the year 
in  our back log has increased steadily and as result of we have selectively increased production capacity  including hiring additional manufacturing employees at certain of our locations 
in  only two employees both in our canadian facilities were laid off 
these layoffs rather than being related to economic conditions were made to improve efficiencies

the average severance was considerably higher in  as the both employees that were laid off were long term employees located in our canadian facility 
canadian law requires that a minimum severance based on years of service be paid to terminated employees 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the comparable period in approximately of the increase is related to increased selling  general and administrative expenses at cvs and naee  attributed to the fact naee and cvs only began operating in june and july  respectively 
as such these operations had essentially no selling  general and administrative expenses for six months ended june  and cvs had only had limited expenses for the three months ended september   as cvs was still in a start up mode during the third quarter of the majority of the remaining increase is attributed to an increase in selling expense and higher compensation expense related to additional provisions for performance based compensation  a restoration of prior salary reductions and selected increase in staffing 
selling expense increased primarily as the company spent million to attend the con expo trade show 
the con expo show  which is held every three years  was held in las vegas in march of this year 
this show is an international gathering place for the construction industries 
it is estimated that  professionals from around the world attended the show 
increased revenues also contributed to the increase in selling expenses 
other less significant factors  including higher travel expenses  also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expense 
legal settlement at net present value the company has disclosed in its previous filings with the security and exchange commission that its insurance carriers had denied coverage for two product liability suits 
the insurance companies subsequently filed a 
table of contents declaratory judgment action in a us district court  seeking a determination that there was no duty on the part of the liability insurance carriers to defend the company 
the company indicated in its earlier filings that company believed that the insurance companies basis of denial of coverage was improper 
the underlying suits are related to a liability for a product that was manufactured by a predecessor company of our manitex subsidiary 
the product liability of this predecessor company was assumed by various acquiring companies and ultimately became the company s liability when we acquired our manitex subsidiary 
on november  the united states district court for the western district of texas  austin division  the district court granted the company s motion for summary judgment finding that the insurers did have a duty to defend the two product liability claims 
the insurance companies were granted leave to appeal the decision to the fifth circuit court of appeals 
the company has also disclosed in previous filing with the security and exchange commission that on may   that the company had entered into two separate settlement agreements with the two plaintiffs in the underlying product liability lawsuits 
pursuant to these agreements  if the court s decision in the declaratory judgment action were to be affirmed  the plaintiffs will have the opportunity to pursue their recovery solely and exclusively against either or both of the liability insurance carriers and the company itself shall have no liability to the plaintiffs 
if  however  in the declaratory judgment action  it is ultimately determined that there was no duty on the part of the liability insurance carriers to defend the company the company will be liable to the plaintiffs in the total amount of million  payable in equal annual installments over a period of twenty years without interest  beginning at the conclusion of the declaratory judgment action 
on february   the company was informed that the fifth circuit court of appeals reversed the district court s decision and determined that the insurance companies did not have an obligation to defend these two product liability suits 
the company has filed a petition for panel rehearing pursuant to rule of the federal rules of appellate procedure to the fifth circuit court of appeals 
if this petition is denied  or the court determines that its decision was correct  the company will become liable to the plaintiffs for the annual payments described above 
as a result of the recent fifth circuit appeals court ruling  the company concluded that it should recognize the liability under the may  settlement agreements and record a charge to income for this liability in in accordance with current accounting guidance  a liability was recorded for approximately which represents the present value of future payments discounted at a market rate of return in the amount of approximately million and legal fees of million this settlement is of an unusual nature and although it had a significant impact on our results  it is not related to on going activities of the company

interest expense interest expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
decreases in interest rates charged on borrowing under the company s revolving credit facilities were offset by an increase in outstanding debt

the increase in operating income is due to an increase in revenues from to the additional gross profit generated by an increase in revenues offset the effect of a decrease in the gross margin percent and an increase in operating expense 
the gross margin percent declined principally because of an increase in the sale of used construction equipment 
the margins for used equipment are lower than what is generated by the sale of new equipment and parts 
the increase in operating expenses is largely associated with the increase in revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues the equipment distribution segment net revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
approximately million of the increase is related to the sale of used construction equipment 
as mention earlier  we expanded our equipment distribution segment in the second quarter of by creating a new division  north american equipment exchange naee  to market previously owned construction and heavy equipment  domestic and internationally 
this division provides a wide range of used lifting and construction equipment of various ages and condition  and the company has the capability to refurbish the equipment to the customers specification 
operating income loss and operating margins operating income of million for the year ended december  was equivalent to of net revenues compared to an operating loss million for the year ended december  or of net revenues 
the change in operating income is due to an increase in revenues from to the gross margin percent  however  decreased between years due to a change in product mix 
part sales  which have significantly higher margins than unit sales  represent a much lower percent of revenues in than in the percentage of revenues related to part sales is much lower because the sales of used construction equipment increased total revenues significantly but did not generate a corresponding increase in part sales 
we did not expect a corresponding increase in part sales as our current part sales business supports a very broad customer base both nationally and internationally 
an increase in operating expenses  associated with increased revenues  in part offsets the increase in gross profit 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december   the company had approximately million available to borrow under its credit facilities 
additionally  the company s us revolving credit facility was amended in february to increase the revolving credit maximum amount from million to million 
the effect of this amendment was an immediate increase of approximately million based on collateral that existed on january  in the amount that the company could borrow under its us revolving credit facility 
the company needs cash to meet its working capital needs as the business grows  to acquire capital equipment  and to fund acquisitions and debt repayment 
we intend to use cash flows from operations and existing availability under the current revolving credit facilities to fund anticipated levels of operations for approximately the next months 
as our availability under our credit lines is limited  it is important that we manage our working capital 
we may need to raise additional capital through debt or equity financings to support our growth strategy  which may include additional acquisitions 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available or  if available  on acceptable terms

approximately of the increase in accounts receivable including other receivables and approximately a third of the increase in inventory are related to operations that began operating in during the remaining increases in accounts receivable and inventory are attributed to increased revenues at our core business 
the increase in accounts receivable finance is due to the fact that the company leased container handling equipment to customers for the first time during the decrease in prepaid expenses is due to a decrease in deposits made in connection with inventory purchase orders 
in the prior year  cvs was often required to make deposits when it ordered inventory as the predecessor company had gone bankrupt

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for products shipped fob destination  sales are recognized when the product reaches its fob destination  or when the services are rendered  which represents the point when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer 
for products shipped fob shipping point  revenue is recognized when the product is shipped  as this is the point when title and risk of loss pass from us to our customers 
customers may be invoiced prior to the time customers take physical possession 
revenue is recognized in such cases only when the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the units  the units have been completed  
table of contents tested and made available to the customer for pickup or delivery  and the customer has authorized in writing that we hold the units for pickup or delivery at a time specified by the customer 
in such cases  the units are invoiced under our customary billing terms  title to the units and risks of ownership pass to the customer upon invoicing  the units are segregated from our inventory and identified as belonging to the customer and we have no further obligations under the order 
the company establishes reserve for future warranty expense at the point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
foreign currency translation and transactions 
the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are translated using the current exchange rate for assets and liabilities and the weighted average exchange rate for the year for income and expense items 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a component of stockholders equity 
the company converts receivables and payables denominated in other than the company s functional currency at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date 
the resulting transaction exchange gains or losses  except for certain transaction gains or losses related to intercompany receivable and payables  are included in other income and expense 
transaction gains and losses related to intercompany receivables and payables not anticipated to be settled in the foreseeable future are excluded from the determination of net income and are recorded as a translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income oci as a component of stockholders equity 
forward currency exchange contracts 
the company s risk management objective is to use the most efficient and effective methods available to us to minimize  eliminate  reduce or transfer the risks which are associated with fluctuation of exchange rates between the canadian and us dollar and the euro and us dollar 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts in relationship such that the exchange gains and losses on the assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency would be offset by the changes in the market value of the forward currency exchange contracts it holds 
the forward currency exchange contracts that the company has to offset existing assets and liabilities denominated in other than the reporting units functional currency have been determined not to be considered a hedge under asc the company records at the balance sheet date the forward currency exchange contracts at its market value with any associated gain or loss being recorded in current earnings 
both realized and unrealized gains and losses related to forward currency contracts are included in current earnings and are reflected in the statement of operations in the other income expense section on the line titled foreign currency transaction losses 
items denominated in other than a reporting units functional currency includes us denominated accounts receivables and accounts payable held by our canadian subsidiary 
the company also has an intercompany receivable from its italian subsidiary  which it anticipates will be repaid 
the company has a forward currency contract which is intended to offset a substantial portion of any exchange gain or loss on this intercompany balance 
the company has entered into forward currency contracts to hedge certain future us dollar sales of its canadian subsidiary 
when the company s canadian subsidiary receives a significant new us dollar order  management will evaluate different options that may be available to mitigate future currency exchange risks 
the decision to hedge future sales is not automatic and is decided case by case 
the company will only use hedge instruments to hedge firm existing sales orders and not estimated exposure  when management determines that exchange risks exceeds desired risk tolerance levels 
the forward currency contracts to hedge future sales are designated as cash flow hedges under asc as required  forward currency contracts are recognized as an asset or liability at fair value on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
table of contents date of sale 
gains or losses on cash flow hedges when recognized into income are included in net revenues 
gains and losses on the derivative instruments representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
the company expects minimal ineffectiveness as the company has hedged only firm sales orders and has not hedged estimated exposures allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
inventories and related reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and are reduced by a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated reserve is based upon specific identification of excess or obsolete inventories 
other intangible assets 
the company accounts for other intangible assets under the guidance of asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
the company capitalizes certain costs related to patent technology 
additionally  a substantial portion of the purchase price related to the company s acquisitions has been assigned to patents or unpatented technology  trade name  customer backlog  and customer relationships 
under the guidance  other intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment 
goodwill 
goodwill  representing the difference between the total purchase price and the fair value of assets tangible and intangible and liabilities at the date of acquisition is reviewed for impairment annually  and more frequently as circumstances warrant  and written down only in the period in which the recorded value of such assets exceed their fair value 
the company does not amortize goodwill in accordance with financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
the company selected october as the date for the required annual impairment test 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business for which discrete financial information with similar economic characteristics is available and the operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s management 
the company s two operating segments comprise the reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes 
we early adopted the fasb asu no 
 testing goodwill for impairment  in connection with the performance of our annual goodwill impairment testing 
under asu  entities are provided with the option of first performing a qualitative assessment on none  some  or all of its reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if after completing a qualitative analysis  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value a quantitative analysis is required 
the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two step process 
the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
during the first step  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment using a business valuation method  which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax projected future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
this analysis did not indicate impairment 
the market approach was also considered in evaluating the potential for impairment by calculating fair value based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of comparable  publicly traded companies 
this analysis also did not indicate impairment 
moreover  we also observed implied ebitda multiples from relatively recent merger and acquisition activity in the industry  which was used to test the reasonableness of the results 

table of contents the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted 
the determination of fair value requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  revenue growth and operating earnings projections  discount rates  terminal growth rates  and required capital expenditure projections 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with our projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event we determine that goodwill is impaired in the future  we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company s policy is to assess the realizability of its long lived assets  including intangible assets  and to evaluate such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or group of assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined to exist if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value 
future cash flow projections include assumptions for future sales levels  the impact of cost reduction programs  and the level of working capital needed to support each business 
the amount of any impairment then recognized would be calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
the company did not have any impairment for the years ended december   and warranty expense 
the company establishes reserves for future warranty expense at point when revenue is recognized by the company and is based on a percentage of revenues 
the provision for estimated warranty claims  which is included in cost of sales  is based on sales 
litigation claims 
in determining whether liabilities should be recorded for pending litigation claims  the company must assess the allegations and the likelihood that it will successfully defend itself 
when the company believes it is probable that it will not prevail in a particular matter  it will then make an estimate of the amount of liability based  in part  on the advice of outside legal counsel 
deferred income taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  and our forecast of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
computation of earnings per share 
basic earnings per share eps was computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
securities of a subsidiary that were convertible into its parent company s common stock were considered among potential common shares of the parent company for the purposes of computing consolidated diluted eps until conversion occurred 
business combinations 
the company accounts for acquisitions in accordance with guidance found in asc  business combinations 
the guidance  effective january   requires consideration given  including contingent consideration  assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be valued at their fair market values at the 
table of contents acquisition date 
the guidance further provides that in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset  acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
asc requires that any excess of purchase price over fair value of assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed be recognized as goodwill 
in accordance with asc  any excess of fair value of acquired net assets  including identifiable intangibles assets  over the acquisition consideration results in a bargain purchase gain 
prior to recording a gain  the acquiring entity must reassess whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and perform re measurements to verify that the consideration paid  assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been properly valued 
recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting guidance on january   the company adopted asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
this asu amended the criteria for when to evaluate individual delivered items in a multiple deliverable arrangement and how to allocate consideration received 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on january   the company adopted asu no 
 business combinations topic 
this asu clarifies the acquisition date that should be used for reporting pro forma financial information for business combinations 
if comparative financial statements are presented  the pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the comparable prior reporting period should be reported as though the acquisition date had been completed as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 compensation retirement benefits multiemployer plans 
asu is intended to enhance the disclosure requirements for employers participating in multiemployer pension plans to improve transparency and increase awareness of the commitments and risks involved with participation in multiemployer plans 
the new accounting guidance requires employers participating in multiemployer plans to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures to provide users with more detailed information regarding an employer s involvement in multiemployer plans 
the new standard is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of this standard on december  did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on october   the company early adopted accounting standard update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted 
the company has incorporated this guidance into its goodwill testing for impairment 
see note for additional information accounting guidance issued but not adopted as of december  in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in 
table of contents this asu generally represent clarification of topic  but also include instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and are to be applied prospectively 
early application is not permitted 
the company is in the process of assessing the impact  if any  that the adoption of asu will have on its results of operations or its financial position 
in june  the fasb issued asu presentation of comprehensive income asu 
this asu requires entities to present reclassification adjustments included in other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements and allows entities to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
it also eliminates the option for entities to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
for public companies  asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
in december  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
 which defers certain aspects of asu related to the presentation of reclassification adjustment 
the adoption of the revised guidance on january  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the new presentation will be included in the company s quarterly reporting on form q for the quarter ended march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not required for smaller reporting filers
