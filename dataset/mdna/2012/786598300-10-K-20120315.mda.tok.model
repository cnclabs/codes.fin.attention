item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item business  item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of saga communications  inc and its subsidiaries contained elsewhere herein 
the following discussion is presented on both a consolidated and segment basis 
corporate general and administrative expenses  interest expense  other income expense  and income tax expense benefit are managed on a consolidated basis and are reflected only in our discussion of consolidated results 
our discussion of the results of operations of our operating segments focuses on their operating income because we manage our operating segments primarily based on their operating income 
we evaluate the operating performance of our markets individually 
for purposes of business segment reporting  we have aligned operations with similar characteristics into two business segments radio and television 
the radio segment includes twenty three markets  which includes all ninety one of our radio stations and five radio information networks 
the television segment includes three markets and consists of five television stations and four low power television lptv stations 
general we are a broadcast company primarily engaged in acquiring  developing and operating broadcast properties 
radio segment our radio segment s primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
depending on the format of a particular radio station  there are a predetermined number of advertisements available to be broadcast each hour 
most advertising contracts are short term and generally run for a few weeks only 
the majority of our revenue is generated from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each radio markets sales staff 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our radio segment s gross revenue was from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage independent advertising sales representative firms that specialize in national sales for each of our broadcast markets 
our revenue varies throughout the year 
advertising expenditures  our primary source of revenue  generally have been lowest during the winter months  which include the first quarter of each year 
we experienced a significant increase in political advertising in due to the number of congressional  senatorial  gubernatorial and local elections in most of our markets 
because was a non election year  political revenue significantly declined 
we expect a considerable increase in political advertising for  which is a presidential election year 
our net operating revenue  station operating expense and operating income varies from market to market based upon the market s rank or size which is based upon population and the available radio advertising revenue in that particular market 
the broadcasting industry and advertising in general  is influenced by the state of the overall economy  including unemployment rates  inflation  energy prices and consumer interest rates 
our stations primarily broadcast in small to midsize markets 
historically  these markets have been more stable than major metropolitan markets during downturns in advertising spending  but may not experience increases in such spending as significant as those in major metropolitan markets in periods of economic improvement 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the rates a station is able to charge are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers 
in a number of our markets this is measured by periodic reports generated by independent national rating services 
in the remainder of our markets it is measured by the results advertisers obtain through the actual running of an advertising schedule 
advertisers measure these results based on increased demand for their goods 
table of contents or services and or actual revenues generated from such demand 
various factors affect the rate a station can charge  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming  local market competition  target marketing capability of radio compared to other advertising media and signal strength 
when we acquire and or begin to operate a station or group of stations we generally increase programming and advertising and promotion expenses to increase our share of our target demographic audience 
our strategy sometimes requires levels of spending commensurate with the revenue levels we plan on achieving in two to five years 
during periods of economic downturns  or when the level of advertising spending is flat or down across the industry  this strategy may result in the appearance that our cost of operations are increasing at a faster rate than our growth in revenues  until such time as we achieve our targeted levels of revenue for the acquired station or group of stations 
the number of advertisements that can be broadcast without jeopardizing listening levels and the resulting ratings is limited in part by the format of a particular radio station 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and by adjusting prices based upon local market conditions and ratings 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of the day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
any change in our revenue  with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold  is generally the result of inventory sell out ratios and pricing adjustments  which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory 
our radio stations employ a variety of programming formats 
we periodically perform market research  including music evaluations  focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies 
because reaching a large and demographically attractive audience is crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong listener loyalty 
our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following 
we believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in musical tastes of the public on any particular format 
the primary operating expenses involved in owning and operating radio stations are employee salaries  sales commissions  programming expenses  depreciation  and advertising and promotion expenses 
the radio broadcasting industry is subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services such as the internet  satellite radio and mp players 
these recent technologies and media are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media 
we are continuing to expand our interactive initiative to provide a seamless audio experience across numerous platforms to connect with our listeners where and when they want  and have added online components including streaming our stations over the internet and on demand options 
third and fourth generation mobile networks have enabled a steady increase in the audio quality and reliability of mobile internet radio streaming  and this is expected to continue to increase as fourth generation networks become the standard 
we expect that improvements from higher bandwidths  wider programming selection and advancements in functionality will continue making internet radio and smartphone applications an important revenue source 
in addition  we continue the rollout of hd radio tm 
hd radio tm utilizes digital technology that provides improved sound quality over standard analog broadcasts and also allows for the delivery of additional channels of diversified programming or data streams in each radio market 
during the years ended december   and  our bellingham  washington  des moines  iowa  manchester  new hampshire  and milwaukee  wisconsin markets  when combined  represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net operating revenue 
an adverse change in any of these radio markets or relative market position in those markets could have a significant impact on our operating results as a whole 

table of contents we have experienced a decline in our net operating revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period of in our milwaukee  wisconsin market 
this decline in net operating revenue has directly affected the operating income of our radio stations in these markets 
these reductions are attributable to a combination of aggressive competitive pricing due to a soft economy and new ratings methodology that has changed the competitive pricing landscape in the market  an increase in the demand for second spots which has caused a reduction in both our rates and inventory available as we control the number of units per hour to provide more entertainment for our listeners  and a decline in certain key category spending in the market 
the following tables describe the percentage of our consolidated net operating revenue represented by each of these markets percentage of consolidated net operating revenue for the years ended december  market bellingham  washington des moines  iowa manchester  new hampshire milwaukee  wisconsin we use certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap to assess our financial performance 
for example  we evaluate the performance of our markets based on station operating income operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangible assets  less gain on asset exchange 
station operating income is generally recognized by the broadcasting industry as a measure of performance  is used by analysts who report on the performance of the broadcasting industry and it serves as an indicator of the market value of a group of stations 
in addition  we use it to evaluate individual stations  market level performance  overall operations and as a primary measure for incentive based compensation of executives and other members of management 
station operating income is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available to us for debt service requirements  other commitments  reinvestment or other discretionary uses 
station operating income is not a measure of liquidity or of performance in accordance with gaap  and should be viewed as a supplement to  and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on a gaap basis 
during the years ended december   and  the radio stations in our four largest markets when combined  represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated station operating income 
the following tables describe the percentage of our consolidated station operating income represented by each of these markets percentage of consolidated station operating income for the years ended december  market bellingham  washington des moines  iowa manchester  new hampshire milwaukee  wisconsin operating income excluding non cash impairment charge in plus corporate general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  less gain on asset exchange 

table of contents television segment our television segment s primary source of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations 
the number of advertisements available for broadcast on our television stations is limited by network affiliation and syndicated programming agreements and  with respect to children s programs  federal regulation 
our television stations local market managers determine the number of advertisements to be broadcast in locally produced programs only  which are primarily news programming and occasionally local sports or information shows 
our net operating revenue  station operating expense and operating income vary from market to market based upon the market s rank or size  which is based upon population  available television advertising revenue in that particular market  and the popularity of programming being broadcast 
our financial results are dependent on a number of factors  the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers 
the rates a station is able to charge are  in large part  based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic groups targeted by its advertisers  as measured principally by periodic reports by independent national rating services 
various factors affect the rate a station can charge  including the general strength of the local and national economies  population growth  ability to provide popular programming through locally produced news  sports and weather and as a result of syndication and network affiliation agreements  local market competition  the ability of television broadcasting to reach a mass appeal market compared to other advertising media  and signal strength including cable satellite coverage  and government regulation and policies 
our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly adjusting prices for our commercial spots based upon local market conditions  advertising demands and ratings 
while there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of day  the total number of advertisements broadcast on a station generally does not vary significantly from year to year 
any change in our revenue  with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold  is generally the result of pricing adjustments  which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory 
because audience ratings in the local market are crucial to a station s financial success  we endeavor to develop strong viewer loyalty by providing locally produced news  weather and sports programming 
we believe that this emphasis on the local market provides us with the viewer loyalty we are trying to achieve 
most of our revenue is generated from local advertising  which is sold primarily by each television markets sales staff 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our television segment s gross revenue was from local advertising 
to generate national advertising sales  we engage independent advertising sales representatives that specialize in national sales for each of our television markets 
we had a significant increase in political advertising in due to the number of congressional  senatorial  gubernatorial and local elections in most of our markets 
since was a non election year  political revenue significantly declined 
we expect a considerable increase in political advertising for  which is a presidential election year 
in we entered into retransmission consent agreements with certain cable and satellite providers as to the terms of their carriage of our television stations  and the compensation we would receive for granting such carriage rights 
we recognized revenue of approximately  for the year ended december  as a result of these agreements 
in we engaged in negotiating new agreements with these and other providers which will result in a significant increase in our retransmission consent revenue 
we expect to recognize revenue of approximately million in and  per the terms of our network affiliation agreements  we expect to remit approximately  of this revenue to our network partners as their share of our retransmission consent revenue

critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures and contingencies 
we evaluate estimates used in preparation of our financial statements on a continual basis  including estimates related to the following revenue recognition revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers is recognized when commercials are broadcast 
revenue is reported net of advertising agency commissions 
agency commissions  when applicable  are based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
all revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 topic  revenue recognition revised and updated and the accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition 
carrying value of accounts receivable and related allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  credit history  etc  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on past loss history and the length of time the receivables are past due  ranging from for 
table of contents amounts days outstanding to for amounts over days outstanding 
if our evaluations of the collectability of our accounts receivable differ from actual results  additional bad debt expense and allowances may be required 
our historical estimates have been a reliable method to estimate future allowances and our reserves have averaged approximately of our outstanding receivables 
the effect of an increase in our allowance of of our outstanding receivables as of december   from to or from  to  would result in a decrease in net income of  net of taxes for the year ended december  purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values as of the acquisition date 
the excess of consideration paid over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair values of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  asset lives and market multiples  among other items 
broadcast licenses and goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past for which a significant amount of the purchase price was allocated to broadcast licenses and goodwill assets 
as of december   we have recorded approximately  in broadcast licenses  which represents of our total assets 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must conduct impairment testing and charge to operations an impairment expense only in the periods in which the carrying value of these assets is more than their fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of  for broadcast licenses 
our goodwill was fully impaired in  therefore we have no goodwill at december  we completed the impairment test for broadcast licenses during the fourth quarter of and determined that the fair value of the broadcast licenses was greater than the carrying value recorded for each of our markets and  accordingly  no impairment was recorded 
we believe our estimate of the value of our broadcast licenses is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future operating performance of our stations 
these variables include but are not limited to the forecast growth rate of each radio and television market  including population  household income  retail sales and other expenditures that would influence advertising expenditures  market share and profit margin of an average station within a market  estimated capital start up costs and losses incurred during the early years  risk adjusted discount rate  the likely media competition within the market area  and terminal values 
changes in our estimates of the fair value of these assets could result in material future period write downs in the carrying value of our broadcast licenses 
for illustrative purposes only  had the fair values of each of our broadcasting licenses been lower by as of december   the company would have recorded a broadcast license impairment of approximately million  had the fair values of each of our broadcasting licenses been lower by as of december   the company would have recorded a broadcast license impairment of approximately million  and had the fair value of our broadcasting licenses been lower by as of december   the company would have recorded a broadcast license impairment of approximately million 
please refer to note broadcast licenses and other intangible assets  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of several key assumptions used in the fair value estimate of our broadcast licenses during our fourth quarter annual impairment test 
market capitalization as of december   our total market capitalization was million more than our book value 
we believe this difference can be attributed to the increase in our stock price in and a reduction in equity book value due to impairments to broadcasting licenses and goodwill in and in the accompanying notes to the financial statements  please refer to note broadcast licenses and other intangible assets  for a discussion of impairment charges in 
table of contents stock based compensation we use a black scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock based awards 
under the fair value method  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period
