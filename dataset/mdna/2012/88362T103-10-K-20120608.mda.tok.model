actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
overview we are one of the largest providers of highly engineered thermal solutions for process industries 
for over years  we have served a diverse base of thousands of customers around the world in attractive and growing markets  including energy  chemical processing and power generation 
we are a global leader and one of the few thermal solutions providers with a global footprint and a full suite of products and services required to deliver comprehensive solutions to complex projects 
we serve our customers locally through a global network of sales and service professionals and distributors in more than countries and through our four manufacturing facilities on three continents 
these global capabilities and longstanding relationships with some of the largest multinational energy  chemical processing  power and epc companies in the world have enabled us to diversify our revenue streams and opportunistically access high growth markets worldwide 
for fiscal  approximately of our revenues were generated outside of the united states 
revenue 
our revenues are derived from providing customers with a full suite of innovative and reliable heat tracing solutions  including electric and steam heat tracing  tubing bundles  control systems  design optimization  engineering services and installation services 
our sales are primarily to industrial customers for petroleum and chemical plants  oil and gas production facilities and power generation facilities 
demand for industrial heat tracing solutions falls into two categories i new facility construction  which we refer to as greenfield projects  and ii recurring maintenance  repair and operations and facility upgrades or expansions  which we refer to as mro ue 
greenfield construction projects often require comprehensive heat tracing solutions 
we believe that greenfield revenue consists of sales revenues by customer in excess of million annually excluding sales to agents  who typically resell our products to multiple customers  and typically includes most orders for projects related to facilities that are new or that are built independent of existing facilities 
we refer to sales revenues by customer of less than million annually  which we believe are typically derived from mro ue  as mro ue revenue 
based on our experience  we believe that million in annual sales is an appropriate threshold for distinguishing between greenfield revenue and mro ue revenue 
however  we often sell our products to intermediaries or subcontract our services  accordingly  we have limited visibility into how our products or services may ultimately be used and can provide no assurance that our categorization may accurately reflect the sources of such revenue 
furthermore  our customers do not typically enter into long term forward maintenance contracts with us 
in any given year  certain of our smaller greenfield projects may generate less than million in annual sales  and certain of our larger plant expansions or upgrades may generate in excess of million in annual sales  though we believe that such exceptions are few in number and insignificant to our overall results of operations 
we believe that our pipeline of planned projects  as evidenced by our growing backlog of signed purchase orders  provides us with strong visibility into our future revenue  as historically we have experienced few order cancellations  and the cancellations that have occurred in the past have not been material compared to our total contract volume or total backlog 
the small number of order cancellations is attributable in part to the fact that a large portion of our solutions are ordered and installed toward the end of greenfield project construction 
our backlog at march  was million 
the timing of recognition of revenue out of backlog is not always certain  as it is subject to a variety of factors that may cause delays  many of which are beyond our control such 
table of contents as customers delivery schedules and levels of capital and maintenance expenditures 
when delays occur  the recognition of revenue associated with the delayed project is likewise deferred 
cost of sales 
our cost of revenues includes primarily the cost of raw material items used in the manufacture of our products  cost of ancillary products that are sourced from external suppliers and construction labor cost 
additional costs of revenue include contract engineering cost directly associated to projects  direct labor cost  external sales commissions  and other costs associated with our manufacturing fabrication shops 
the other costs associated with our manufacturing fabrication shops are mainly indirect production costs  including depreciation  indirect labor costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
key raw material costs include polymers  copper  stainless steel  insulating material  and other miscellaneous parts related to products manufactured or assembled as part of our heat tracing solutions 
historically  the costs of our primary raw materials have been stable and readily available from multiple suppliers  and we have been generally successful with passing along raw material cost increases to our customers 
therefore  increases in the cost of key raw materials of our products have not generally affected our gross margins 
we cannot provide any assurance that we may be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers in the future  and if we are unable to do so  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
operating expenses 
our marketing  general and administrative and engineering expenses are primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for sales  marketing  pre sales engineering and administrative personnel  as well as other sales related expenses and other costs related to research and development  insurance  professional fees  the global integrated business information system  provisions for bad debts and warranty 
key drivers affecting our results of operations 
our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors  including those described above under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report and those described below timing of greenfield projects 
our results of operations in recent years have been impacted by the various construction phases of large greenfield projects 
on very large projects  we are typically designated as the heat tracing provider of choice by the project owner 
we then engage with multiple contractors to address incorporating various heat tracing solutions throughout the overall project 
our largest greenfield projects may generate revenue for several quarters 
in the early stages of a greenfield project  our revenues are typically realized from the provision of engineering services 
in the middle stages  or the material requirements phase  we typically experience the greatest demand for our heat tracing cable  at which point our revenues tend to accelerate 
revenues tend to decrease gradually in the final stages of a project and are generally derived from installation services and demand for electrical panels and other miscellaneous electronic components used in the final installation of heat tracing cable  which we frequently outsource from third party manufacturers 
therefore  we typically provide a mix of products and services during each phase of a greenfield project  and our margins fluctuate accordingly 
cyclicality of end users markets 
demand for our products and services depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures of our customers and end users  in particular those in the energy  chemical processing and power generation industries  and firms that design and construct facilities for these industries 
these customers expenditures historically have been cyclical in nature and vulnerable to economic downturns 
greenfield projects  and in particular large greenfield projects ie  new facility construction projects generating in excess of million in annual sales  have been a substantial source of revenue growth in recent years  and greenfield revenues tend to be more cyclical than mro ue revenues 
in recent years we have noted particular cyclicality in capital spending for new facilities in asia  eastern europe and the middle east 
revenues derived from europe including the middle east  which have historically comprised a relatively minor portion of such revenues accounted for and of our total revenues during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and revenues derived from the asia pacific region accounted for and of our total revenues during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a sustained decrease in capital and maintenance spending or in new facility construction by our customers could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and services and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
impact of product mix 
typically  both greenfield and mro ue customers require our products as well as our engineering and construction services 
the level of service and construction needs will affect the profit margin for each type of revenue 
we tend to experience lower margins from our design optimization  engineering  installation and maintenance services than we do from sales of our heating cable  tubing bundle and control system products 
we also tend to experience lower margins from our outsourced products  such as electrical switch gears and transformers  than we do from our manufactured products 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by our mix of products and services 

table of contents we estimate that greenfield and mro ue have each made the following contribution as a percentage of revenue in the periods listed fiscal year ended march greenfield mro ue we believe that our analysis of greenfield and mro ue is an important measurement to explain the trends in our business to investors 
greenfield revenue is an indicator of both our ability to successfully compete for new contracts as well as the economic health of the industries we serve 
furthermore  greenfield revenue is an indicator of potential mro ue revenue in future years 
for mro ue orders  the sale of our manufactured products typically represents a higher proportion of the overall revenues associated with such order than the provision of our services 
greenfield projects  on the other hand  require a higher level of our services than mro ue orders 
therefore  we typically realize higher margins from mro ue revenues than greenfield revenues 
large and growing installed base 
customers typically use the incumbent heat tracing provider for mro ue projects to avoid complications and compatibility problems associated with switching providers 
therefore  with the significant greenfield activity we have experienced in recent years  our installed base has continued to grow  and we expect that such installed base will continue to generate ongoing high margin mro ue revenues 
for fiscal  mro ue sales comprised approximately of our consolidated revenues 
seasonality of mro ue revenues 
revenues realized from mro ue orders tend to be less cyclical than greenfield projects and more consistent quarter over quarter  although mro ue revenues are impacted by seasonal factors 
mro ue revenues are typically highest during the second and third fiscal quarters  as most of our customers perform preventative maintenance prior to the winter season

for comparability to the periods discussed herein  please refer to note to the table set forth in item  selected financial data 
revenues 
revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
during fiscal we experienced growth in both greenfield and mro sales 
in fiscal  we experienced higher than usual greenfield sales at approximately of total revenue 
in fiscal  greenfield sales contributed approximately to total revenue  whereas mro ue sales contributed approximately  which is more in line with our expected product mix based on historical results 
during fiscal  we continued to experience sales growth from oil and gas production and refining  especially as it relates to activity in arctic climates 
also in fiscal  we experienced approximately million in unanticipated sales due to freeze protection initiatives on existing electrical power plants located in the southern united states 
these projects were in response to power disruptions due to an unusually cold weather during the previous winter 
while we may experience other such sources of unexpected revenue  we do not expect these particular power generation sales for an extended period in the future 
revenues increased in all geographies in which we operate during fiscal revenue in the western hemisphere increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue in the eastern hemisphere increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we expect that revenue contributed from large greenfield projects will fluctuate from period to period as construction schedules are inherently difficult to estimate 
while our percentage of revenue from mro ue during fiscal was comparable to historical averages  we expect mro ue percentage to fluctuate as large project volume increases or decreases 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of revenues  profit margin increased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal  there was a non cash million negative impact to gross profit due to a purchase accounting adjustment related to the chs transactions 
under purchase accounting rules  inventories that were carried at lower of cost or market are stepped up to fair value  which eliminates gross profit in the period in which the units are sold 
excluding the purchase accounting adjustment  gross margin would have been in fiscal on an adjusted basis  profit margin was higher in fiscal this increase is attributable to the higher mix of mro ue sales during the year as mro ue revenue generally provides us with higher gross margins 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering costs were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase is mostly 
table of contents attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits of million to support our growing business 
of this amount  we had a million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the acceleration of employee stock options at the ipo date 
during fiscal we added additional employees to support our growing sales and engineering needs 
fiscal also reflected an increase of million in management fees paid to our private equity sponsors over fiscal management fee expense of million during fiscal included a payment of million in connection with the termination of the management services agreement at the time of the ipo 
as a percentage of revenues  marketing  general and administrative and engineering expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal excluding the management fees  that will no longer be recurring  marketing  general and administrative and engineering would have been of revenue 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
we expect that fiscal is more representative of our estimated expense for amortization of intangible assets for the foreseeable future subject to foreign translation adjustments 
amortization of intangible assets was higher in fiscal because it included the amortization of estimated backlog that was expensed over five months  which was the estimated life for that intangible asset generated by the chs transactions 
the amortization related to backlog accounted for the entire million difference between the comparative periods 
interest expense  net 
interest expense and loss on redemptions of debt combine for a total of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
in fiscal  we made redemptions on our senior notes totaling million and in fiscal  our predecessor repaid million of debt in connection with the completion of the chs transactions which occurred april  as a result of these repayments  deferred debt cost acceleration and other prepayment costs totaled million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest expense on outstanding principal was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  a decrease in expense of million 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal consisted primarily of a million loss on foreign exchange transactions 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal consisted primarily of million in fees and expenses related to the chs transactions 
we did not incur any chs transaction expenses in fiscal income taxes 
we reported an income tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to an million tax benefit in fiscal  an increase of million 
the effective tax rates were in fiscal and a benefit rate of in fiscal we have subsidiaries in multiple foreign locations and the statutory income tax rate in many of our foreign subsidiaries is lower than the us federal rate of 
to the extent that we expect to repatriate dividends from these subsidiaries  we are required to accrue the estimated incremental us tax in anticipation of the foreign dividends being repatriated 
the accrual for these estimated taxes results in an effective tax rate which is nearly the same as the us federal statutory rate plus state and other miscellaneous taxes 
subject to events which may trigger a change in our deferred tax assets and liabilities  we expect that the fiscal tax rate will be a reasonable estimation of our effective tax for our operations in the future 
see also note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements of tgh 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by the chs transactions 
permanent items recorded in fiscal included non deductible portions of the chs transactions costs as well a recorded valuation allowance on foreign tax carry forwards 
net income loss 
net income was million in fiscal as compared to net loss of million in fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase in net income was primarily due to increased gross profit in fiscal of million 
increased net income was also impacted by the elimination or reduction of expenses incurred in fiscal in connection with the chs transactions 
these included the transaction fees and expenses of million and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of million 
in addition  interest expense decreased by million as compared to fiscal due to decreased levels of indebtedness 
in total  increased gross profit  the decreases in amortization of intangible assets  interest expense and transaction costs related to the chs transactions comprise million in positive impacts to fiscal net income 
these were offset in fiscal by increased marketing  general  and administrative expenses of and income tax expense of million and other increased miscellaneous expense of million

revenues 
revenues for fiscal were million  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  mostly due to an increase in large greenfield project activity in fiscal  which accounted for million of the increase 
separately  revenues increased in all geographies in which we operate during fiscal revenue in the western hemisphere increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenue in the eastern hemisphere increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal one major project in eastern europe accounted for million of this increase 
gross profit and margin 
gross profit totaled million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal in fiscal there was a non cash million negative impact to gross profit due to a purchase accounting adjustment related to the chs transactions 
under purchase accounting rules  inventories that were carried at lower of cost or market are stepped up to fair value  which eliminates gross profit in the period in which the units are sold 
excluding the purchase accounting adjustment  gross margin would have been in fiscal in addition  fiscal gross margin was positively affected by a million favorable adjustment related to the release of accruals for certain expenses on long term projects in russia 
after taking into account this adjustment  gross margin would have been in fiscal adjusted gross margin decreased marginally by in fiscal as compared to fiscal these adjusted gross margins of and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  are within our expected range of gross margins based on our historical results 
no discernible series of events or factors were responsible for the negligible decline in gross margin over such period 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering 
marketing  general and administrative and engineering costs were million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the overall increase is primarily related to an increase in expenses to address personnel needs to meet growing customer demand 
the expenses contributing to this increase are mostly attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits of million to support our growing business 
in addition  there is an increase of million in management fees paid to our private equity sponsors in fiscal as compared to the predecessors management fees in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  marketing  general and administrative and engineering expenses were comparable across periods in fiscal and in fiscal 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  due to the amortization of certain intangible assets associated with the chs transactions 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million  which is primarily attributable to the increased levels of indebtedness incurred in connection with the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes and the higher interest rate on our senior secured notes as compared to our long term debt prior to the chs transactions 
also included in interest expense are one time financing costs associated with the chs transactions  including million in full amortization of our bridge loan fee  million in accelerated amortization of deferred debt costs associated with repaid debt and million in prepayment penalties 
miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense was million in fiscal  compared to miscellaneous expense of million in fiscal  an increase of million 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal consisted primarily of million of professional fees and expenses related to the chs transactions and partially offset by million income related to adjustment of compliance liabilities 
miscellaneous expense in fiscal consisted primarily of legal  financial and other advisory and consulting fees and expenses incurred when audax commenced an auction process to sell their controlling interest in us and foreign exchange transaction losses  partially offset by a small gain in sales of fixed assets 
income taxes 
income taxes were a benefit of million in fiscal  compared to a million tax expense in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal the effective tax rates were in fiscal and in fiscal the fiscal amounts combine the effects of the chs transactions for the one month period ended april  for which we filed a separate us federal income tax return and the eleven month period ended march  for the one month ended april   we recorded a tax benefit of million as our former owners were able to deduct costs related to the chs transactions 
for the eleven month period ended march   our tax expense was million despite a pre tax loss of million 
the tax expense was due primarily to dividends of million that were repatriated into the us from certain of our foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of fiscal after taking into account the effect of credits for foreign taxes paid  these dividends increased our tax expense by approximately million 
the other significant component of the tax expense in the eleven months ended march  was from earnings at our foreign subsidiaries 
see note  income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for tgh for fiscal  included elsewhere in this annual report  for further detail on income taxes 

table of contents net income loss 
net loss was million in fiscal as compared to net income of million in fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the expenses incurred in fiscal in connection with the chs transactions  including an increase in amortization of intangible assets of million including million in purchase accounting adjustments that had a non cash negative impact to cost of sales and  consequently  gross profit over the prior year 
in addition  interest expense increased by million as compared to fiscal due to increased levels of indebtedness at a higher interest rate incurred in connection with the chs transactions  as described above 
during fiscal  we also incurred million in transaction costs directly related to the chs transactions 
in total  the increases in amortization of intangible assets  interest expense and transaction costs related to the chs transactions comprise million in increased expenses over fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in income tax expense of million due to the income tax benefit of million recorded in fiscal and an increase in gross profit in fiscal of million due to higher sales

contingencies 
we are involved in various legal and administrative proceedings and disputes that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
some of these proceedings may result in fines  penalties or judgments being assessed against us  which  from time to time  may adversely affect our financial results 
for a discussion of contingencies that may adversely affect our results of operations  see note  commitments and contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements of tgh contained elsewhere in this annual report 
we have considered these proceedings and disputes in determining the necessity of any reserves for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable 
our recorded reserves are based on estimates developed with consideration given to the potential merits of claims or quantification of any performance obligations 
in doing so  we take into account our history of claims  the limitations of any insurance coverage  advice from outside counsel  the possible range of outcomes to such claims and obligations and their associated financial impact if known and reasonably estimable  and management s strategy with regard to the settlement or defense of such claims and obligations 
while the ultimate outcome of those claims  lawsuits or performance obligations cannot be predicted with certainty  we believe  based on our understanding of the facts of these claims and performance obligations  that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts where required 
in addition  we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings would have a significant adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of 
table of contents operations  or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to our results or cash flows in any one accounting period 
on july   during construction of the expansion of our manufacturing facility in san marcos  texas  a section of the partially completed steel framework collapsed 
one employee of the construction subcontractor was killed and another was injured during the incident 
none of our employees was on the construction site at the time of the incident 
we understand that both the general contractor and the steel erection subcontractor were issued citations by the occupational safety and heath administration  which we refer to as osha  and have been sued in private actions brought by the decedent s estate as a result of the accident 
we have not been fined or named in any lawsuits related to this matter and do not anticipate incurring any significant losses with respect to this matter that would not be covered by insurance 
on june   we received notice from the canada revenue agency  which we refer to as the agency  advising us that they disagree with the tax treatment we proposed with respect to certain asset transfers that were completed in august by our predecessor owners 
as a result  the agency proposes to disallow the interest deductions taken in canada for tax years  and in total these interest deductions amounted to million 
the statutory tax rate in canada is approximately  accordingly  the agency has made an assessment of approximately million 
at march   we have not recorded a tax liability reserve due for this matter with the agency as a loss is not probable or estimable 
while we will vigorously contest this ruling  we expect that any liability  if any  will be covered under an indemnity agreement with the predecessor owners 
our indian subsidiary is currently disputing assessments of administrative sales tax and customs duties with indian tax and customs authorities 
in addition  we currently have a customs duty case before the supreme court in india  on appeal by custom authorities 
during the year ended march   we concluded settlement of some of these matters whereby thermon paid approximately million 
we have reserved million in estimated settlement of the remaining matters 
other than the items noted above  there are no other gains or losses or litigation settlements that are not provided for in the accounts 
to bid on or secure certain contracts  we are required at times to provide a performance guaranty to our customers in the form of a surety bond  standby letter of credit or foreign bank guaranty 
on march   we had in place standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and performance bonds totaling million to back our various customer contracts 
as of march   we also had in place a million letter of credit as collateral for the revolving facility for our subsidiary in japan 
our indian subsidiary also has million in customs bonds outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility and other revolving lines of credit 
our primary liquidity needs are to finance our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service needs 
on may   we completed a million partial redemption of our senior secured notes 
this reduced our aggregate principal balance of the senior secured notes to million and in turn reduced our future annual interest expense on these notes to million 
cash and cash equivalents 
at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents at various financial institutions located in many countries throughout the world 
approximately million  or  of these amounts were held in domestic accounts with various institutions and approximately million  or  of these amounts were held in accounts outside of the united states with various financial institutions 

table of contents revolving credit facility and senior secured notes 
revolving credit facility 
simultaneously with the closing of the chs transactions and the sale of our senior secured notes  our wholly owned subsidiary  thermon industries  inc  entered into a five year  million senior secured revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our revolving credit facility  of which up to million is available to our canadian subsidiary  subject to borrowing base availability 
availability of funds under our revolving credit facility is determined by a borrowing base equal to the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  plus of eligible inventory  plus of the net orderly liquidation value of eligible equipment  plus of the fair market value of eligible owned real property 
in no case shall availability under our revolving credit facility exceed the commitments thereunder 
as of march   we had million of capacity available under our revolving credit facility after taking into account the borrowing base 
in addition to our revolving credit facility  we have various short term revolving lines of credit available to us at our foreign affiliates  and no borrowings were outstanding under any such lines of credit at march  the revolving credit facility will mature in any borrowings on our revolving credit facility will incur interest expense that is variable in relation to the libor rate 
borrowings denominated in canadian dollars under the canadian sub facility bear interest at a variable rate in relation to the bankers acceptance rate  as set forth in the revolving credit facility 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we are required to pay a per annum commitment fee to the lenders in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder and letter of credit fees equal to the libor margin or the bankers acceptance rate  as applicable  on the undrawn amount of all outstanding letters of credit 
at march   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate would have been if borrowings were outstanding 
senior secured notes 
we have incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the senior secured notes 
as of march   we had million of indebtedness outstanding under the senior secured notes with annual cash interest expense of approximately million 
our senior secured notes mature on may  and accrue interest at a fixed rate of 
we pay interest in cash semi annually on may and november of each year 
our senior secured notes were issued by our wholly owned subsidiary thermon industries  inc in a rule a exempt senior secured note offering to qualified institutional investors 
the proceeds were used to fund the purchase price for the chs transactions and related transaction costs 
in january  we completed an offer to exchange the old restricted senior secured notes for new  sec registered senior secured notes 
in accordance with the terms of our senior secured note indenture  on each of april   june  and may   we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
on august  and october   million and million were repurchased in privately negotiated transactions with noteholders at premiums of and of the principal amount repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  respectively 
after these redemptions 
del  del 
and repurchases  as of may   the aggregate principal balance of the senior secured notes was million 
guarantees  security 
the obligations under our revolving credit facility and our senior secured notes are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by thc and each of its existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  other than thermon industries  inc  the issuer of the senior secured notes 
the obligations under our revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our and the guarantors assets  subject to certain exceptions  permitted liens and encumbrances reasonably acceptable to the agent under our revolving credit facility 
our senior secured notes and guarantees are also secured by liens on substantially all of our and the guarantors assets  subject to certain exceptions  provided  however  that the liens are contractually subordinated to the liens thereon that secure our revolving credit facility 
restrictive covenants 
the revolving credit facility and senior secured notes contain various restrictive covenants that include restrictions or limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue disqualified capital stock unless certain financial tests are satisfied  pay dividends  redeem subordinated debt or make other restricted payments  make certain investments or acquisitions  issue stock of subsidiaries  grant or permit certain liens on our assets  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  merge  consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets  incur dividend or other payment restrictions affecting certain of our subsidiaries  transfer or sell assets  including capital stock of our subsidiaries  and change the business we conduct 
however  all of these covenants are subject to exceptions 
credit risk 
the credit ratings assigned to our senior secured notes reflect the rating agencies assessments of our ability to make payments on our senior secured notes when due 
actual or anticipated changes to our credit rating by any rating agency may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our senior secured notes 
in addition  any downgrade in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 
repatriation considerations 
a substantial portion of our cash flows are generated by our non us subsidiaries 
in general  when an entity in a foreign jurisdiction repatriates cash to the united states  the amount of such cash is treated as a dividend taxable at current us tax rates 
accordingly  upon the distribution of cash to us from our non us subsidiaries  we will be subject to non us 
table of contents income taxes 
although foreign tax credits may be available to reduce the amount of the additional tax liability  these credits may be limited based on our tax attributes 
since the issuance of our senior secured notes on april   we have been able to meet our regular debt service obligations through cash generated through our us operations  and it is our expectation that we will continue to be able to do so in the future 
we did  however  repatriate million and million in fiscal and  respectively  in the form of incremental dividends from our non us subsidiaries in order to complete redemptions of our outstanding senior secured notes which occurred on april  in order to repay our senior secured notes on or before their maturity date  we expect to make further repatriations of our foreign earnings 
the receipt of these dividends had an impact of approximately million to our tax expense for fiscal see also note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements of tgh 
in addition  we accrue the estimated incremental tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to repatriate as dividends 
the accrual for these estimated tax results in an effective tax rate of  which is nearly the same as the us federal statutory rate  plus state and other miscellaneous taxes 
see also note  income taxes to the consolidated financial statements of tgh 
moreover  our ability to repatriate cash from our foreign subsidiaries may be subject to legal  contractual or other restrictions and other business considerations 
see item a  risk factors risks related to our business and industry a significant portion of our business is conducted through foreign subsidiaries and our failure to generate sufficient cash flow from these subsidiaries  or otherwise repatriate or receive cash from these subsidiaries  could result in our inability to repay our indebtedness 
future capital requirements 
based on our current level of operations  however  we believe that cash flow from operations and available cash  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness  including the senior secured notes or our revolving credit facility  or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain events  such as a change of control  we could be required to repay or refinance our indebtedness 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including the senior secured notes or our revolving credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
in fiscal  we invested million in capital expenditures of which million was for our new manufacturing facility in san marcos  texas and million was for a single purchase of a new manufacturing process 
the remaining million represents our annual expected investments in furniture and fixture replacements  minor plant equipment replacement and minor maintenance 
going forward  we expect to invest approximately million in fiscal to refurbish some of our existing manufacturing facilities in san marcos  texas as well as additional recurring investments to replace or extend the lives of plant and equipment 
year ended march  successor compared to the year ended march  predecessor successor combined non gaap net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million for the combined periods in fiscal  a decrease of million 
in fiscal  our operations improved from a loss of million in fiscal to net income of million in fiscal while this improvement amounted to an increase to cash flows of million  the overall decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to the reduction of liabilities during fiscal during fiscal  our cash flow from operations reflected the increase in accounts payable  interest payable  customer prepayments and taxes payable that totaled million 
in fiscal  these same liabilities  as a group  decreased and therefore reflect a use of cash of million 
this change is mostly due to the reduction in taxes payable of million 
with the additional debt from the chs transactions  fiscal reflected an million increase in interest payable 
in total the change in liabilities as presented in our cash flow from operations amounted to a decrease of million 
during fiscal  our receivables grew due to higher sales and our inventory increased as we maintained higher stock levels for higher demand 
the change from all current assets resulted in a decrease in cash flows from operations of million 
also  the change in non cash items such as depreciation  amortization  stock compensation expense and deferred taxes resulted in an increase in cash flow from operations of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the significant increase in cash flows used in investing activities in was attributable to the million purchase price in the chs transactions 
subsequent to the transaction date on april   we paid million in partial settlement of obligations related to the chs transactions 
payment of the million that is estimated to be due to the former shareholders will be reported as additional cash consideration paid for the chs transactions  in future periods 
investing activities in fiscal also consisted of million of 
table of contents capital expenditures 
this included a million investment in a new manufacturing facility on our san marcos  texas campus 
investing activities in fiscal consisted of million of capital expenditures 
net cash used in provided by financing activities totaled million used in fiscal  compared to million provided by financing activities for fiscal in fiscal  we received net proceeds on our ipo of million 
from a combination of ipo proceeds and cash on hand  we redeemed million in aggregate principal of our senior secured notes for a use of cash totaling million including cash premiums paid 
financing activities in fiscal consisted of proceeds from the issuance of million under the senior secured notes  million received from equity investments in us and offset by million used for the payment of deferred debt costs 
year ended march  predecessor successor combined non gaap compared to the year ended march  predecessor net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for the combined fiscal period  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal compared with fiscal was due in large part to higher revenues which generated million more gross profit in fiscal than in fiscal improved operating cash flows were offset by our fiscal net loss of million as compared to fiscal net income of million  a decrease of million 
net loss takes into account certain non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  debt cost amortization  stock based compensation expense and accounting for deferred income taxes 
the effects of these non cash adjustments increased cash flows by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal cash flows from operations in fiscal were negatively impacted by a net increase in operating assets of million as compared to fiscal increases in assets included an increase in inventory of million  as we purchased inventory to meet our customer s needs  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets offset by a reduction in accounts receivable of million  as we were able to reduce our days sales outstanding from to cash flows for fiscal were positively impacted by a net combined increase of million from accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in fiscal as compared to fiscal included in the increase in payables and liabilities is an advance payment of million for the purchase of our products by one of our customers 
these products were substantially delivered in fiscal also included within the overall increase of payables and liabilities were accrued interest of million  accounts payable of million  taxes payable of million and accrued compensation expense of million 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the significant increase in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the million purchase price in the chs transactions 
investing activities in fiscal consisted of million of capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for fiscal  compared to million used in financing activities for fiscal  primarily due to the significant financing activities that occurred in fiscal as part of the chs transactions  including the issuance of million of our senior secured notes  million received from equity investments in us and million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in fiscal  the predecessor paid a dividend to our former owners of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
in addition  we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which includes special purposes entities and other structured finance entities 
effect of inflation while inflationary increases in certain input costs  such as wages  have an impact on our operating results  inflation has had minimal net impact on our operating results during the last three years  as overall inflation has been offset by increased selling prices and cost reduction actions 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will not be affected by general inflation in the future seasonality our quarterly revenues are impacted by the level of large greenfield projects that may be occurring at any given time 
demand for our products depends in large part upon the level of capital and maintenance expenditures by many of our customers and end users  in particular those customers in the oil and gas  refining  and chemical processing markets 
these customers expenditures historically have been cyclical in nature and vulnerable to economic downturns 

table of contents our operating expenses remain relatively consistent with some variability related to overall headcount of the company which increased during fiscal fluctuations in operating expense are partly due to changes in management s estimates for items such inventory reserves and reserves for bad debt 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate based on the cyclical pattern of industries to which we provide heat tracing solutions and the seasonality of mro ue demand for our products 
most of our customers perform preventative maintenance prior to the winter season  thus in our experience making the months of october and november typically our largest for mro ue revenue 
however  revenues from greenfield projects are not seasonal and tend to be level throughout the year  depending on the capital spending environment 
overall  seasonality has a minor effect on the company s business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies are those that materially affect our financial statements and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
our most significant financial statement estimates include revenue recognition  allowances for bad debts  warranty reserves  inventory reserves and potential litigation claims and settlements 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be materially different from the estimates 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of products are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
on average  less than of our annual revenues are derived from the installation of heat tracing solutions for which we apply construction type accounting 
these construction related contracts are awarded on a competitive bid and negotiated basis 
we offer our customers a range of contracting options  including cost reimbursable  fixed price and hybrid  which has both cost reimbursable and fixed price characteristics 
our construction contract revenue is primarily recognized using the percentage of completion method  based on the percentage that actual costs to date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract 
we follow the guidance of fasb asc revenue recognition topic for accounting policies relating to our use of the percentage of completion method  estimating costs and revenue recognition  including the recognition of profit incentives  unapproved change orders and claims and combining and segmenting contracts 
we utilize the cost to cost approach to measure the extent of progress toward completion  as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress 
under the cost to cost approach  the use of total estimated cost to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts 
significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering  materials  components  equipment  labor and subcontracts  labor productivity  schedule durations  including subcontract and supplier progress  liquidated damages  contract disputes  including claims  achievement of contractual performance requirements  and contingency  among others 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates as contracts progress is reflected in the period in which these changes become known  including the recognition of any losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress 
due to the various estimates inherent in our construction contract accounting  actual results could differ from those estimates 
our historical construction contract cost estimates have generally been accurate  and management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or the methodology used to calculate these estimates 
estimating allowances  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts and the adjustment for excess and obsolete inventories 
we make estimates about the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at march  and  respectively 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess or obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated fair market value based on assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
fair market value is determined quarterly by comparing inventory levels of individual products and components to historical usage rates  current backlog and estimated future sales and by analyzing the age and potential applications of inventory  in order to identify specific products and components of inventory that are judged unlikely to be sold 
our finished goods inventory consists primarily of completed electrical cable that has been manufactured for various heat tracing solutions 
most of our manufactured product offerings are built to industry standard specifications that have general purpose applications and therefore are sold to a variety of customers in various industries 
some of our products  such as custom orders and ancillary components outsourced from third party manufacturers  have more specific applications and therefore may be at a higher risk of inventory obsolescence 
inventory is written off in the period in which the disposal occurs 
actual future write offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and 
table of contents calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand  customer negotiations  product application  technology shifts and other factors 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million and million at march  and  respectively 
historically  inventory obsolescence and potential excess cost adjustments have been within our expectations  and management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the inventory valuation reserves 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing these allowances 
if our assumptions used to calculate these allowances do not comport with our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  actual demand for our inventory  or the number of products and installations returned under warranty  additional provisions may be needed and our future results of operations could be adversely affected 
valuation of long lived  goodwill and other intangible assets 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment 
gaap requires that push down accounting be applied for wholly owned subsidiaries if the ownership is percent or more 
in connection with the chs transactions  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets have been allocated to our entities in the united states  canada and europe accordingly 
as such  we have identified three reporting units united states  canada and europe  for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing  which are at a level below our one operating segment 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we perform an annual assessment in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit in which goodwill resides is less than its carrying value 
for reporting units in which this assessment concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
qualitative factors considered in this assessment include industry and market considerations  overall financial performance  and other relevant events and factors affecting the reporting unit 
for reporting units in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying value  we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test  which compares the fair of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if during this second step  we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value we would record an impairment equal to the differences 
as of march   we had goodwill of million  including the impact of the chs transactions 
there have been no impairments of goodwill during the fiscal years ended march  and business combinations 
we allocated the purchase price in connection with the chs transactions to the tangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
the significant purchased intangible assets recorded by us include trademarks  customer relationships  backlog and developed technology 
the fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets are discussed in detail in note  acquisition  goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements of tgh included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  without limitation  future expected cash flows from customer relationships  acquired developed technologies and trademarks and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ 
table of contents from estimates 
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  support obligations assumed  estimated restructuring liabilities and pre acquisition contingencies 
we have attempted to record all known contingencies or obligations in connection with the chs transactions 
while our agreement under the chs transactions provides us with certain indemnity to reimburse for payment on such obligations  costs in excess of our indemnity or accruals will have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations and financial position 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenues and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic earnings and expenses to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
in estimating future tax consequences  all expected future events are considered other than enactments of changes in tax laws or rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts which are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  historical earnings  taxable income in prior years  if carryback is permitted under the law  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such a determination  or goodwill would be adjusted at our final determination of the valuation allowance related to an acquisition within the measurement period 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance as an adjustment to earnings at such time 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we account for these uncertain tax issues pursuant to asc  income taxes  which contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters 
we adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit  judicial rulings  refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates 
to the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made 
our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties 
we expect to repatriate earnings from our foreign operations to the extent that a subsidiary that generates earnings that exceeds their working capital or other investment requirements 
if available  such earnings may be monetized in the form of dividends to the us parent 
accordingly  we accrue the estimated incremental tax on the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we expect to repatriate as dividends 
in developing our estimate of foreign earnings that are available to be repatriated  we consider the required levels of working capital at each subsidiary and accrue a deferred tax liability for the earnings and profits in excess of those requirements 
we consider our original investment and our working capital portion of retained earnings at each of our foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested 
the deferred tax liability recorded on the us financial statements is subject to fluctuations in the local currency exchange rates each year 
loss contingencies 
we accrue for probable losses from contingencies including legal defense costs  on an undiscounted basis  when such costs are considered probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable 
we periodically evaluate available information  both internal and external  relative to such contingencies and adjust this accrual as necessary 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 

table of contents stock based compensation expense 
we account for share based payments to employees in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires that share based payments to the extent they are compensatory be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
in addition  we have applied certain of the provisions of the sec s guidance contained in asc in our accounting for stock based compensation awards 
as required by asc  we recognize stock based compensation expense for share based payments that are expected to vest 
in determining whether an award is expected to vest  we use an estimated  forward looking forfeiture rate based upon our historical forfeiture rates 
stock based compensation expense recorded using an estimated forfeiture rate is updated for actual forfeitures quarterly 
to the extent our actual forfeitures are different than our estimates  we record a true up for the differences in the period that the awards vest  and such true ups could materially affect our operating results 
we also consider on a quarterly basis whether there have been any significant changes in facts and circumstances that would affect our expected forfeiture rate 
we are also required to determine the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date 
for option awards that are subject to service conditions and or performance conditions  we estimate the fair values of employee stock options using a black scholes merton valuation model 
some of our option grants included a market condition for which we used a monte carlo pricing model to establish grant date fair value 
these determinations require judgment  including estimating expected volatility 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be impacted 
pursuant to the outstanding stock option agreements  all outstanding option awards at march  vested and became exercisable immediately prior to the completion of the ipo 
accordingly  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million in connection with the ipo 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb updated fasb asc  comprehensive income fasb asc that gives an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
the update does not change the option for an entity to present components of other comprehensive income either net of related tax effects or before related tax effects  with one amount shown for the aggregate income tax expense or benefit related to the total of other comprehensive income items 
the update does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
the update should be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb updated fasb asc  goodwill and other fasb asc that gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
we adopted this update during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb updated fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures fasb asc that requires additional disclosures and clarifies existing disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the additional disclosures include i transfers in and out of levels and and ii activity in level fair value measurements 
the update provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures on level of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques 
this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
these disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted the update on april  as required and subsequently adopted on april   the update surrounding disclosures on level fair value measurements and concluded it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb updated fasb asc that resulted in common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss 
some of the amendments clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
other amendments change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments are to be applied prospectively and are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december  we will implement this accounting policy during the quarter ending june  we are currently evaluating the requirements of this update and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents non gaap financial measures disclosure in this annual report to adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share or eps  which are non gaap financial measures as defined under the rules of the sec  are intended as supplemental measures of our financial performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
adjusted ebitda represents net income loss before interest expense net of interest income  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization expense and other non cash charges such as stock based compensation expense  transaction expenses incurred in connection with the chs transactions and our ipo  and other transactions not associated with our ongoing operations  such as the loss on retirement of debt  as adjusted to further exclude management and termination fees paid to our private equity sponsors 
adjusted net income represents net income before certain transaction expenses and expenses related with debt redemptions  and adjusted eps represents adjusted net income per fully diluted common share 
we believe these non gaap financial measures are meaningful to our investors to enhance their understanding of our financial performance and are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to compare our performance with the performance of other companies that report adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income or adjusted eps 
adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted eps should be considered in addition to  and not as substitutes for  income from operations  net income loss  net income loss per share and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda  adjusted net income and adjusted eps may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies

b the combined predecessor successor period in fiscal includes months under the current capital structure of the successor 
we have presented adjusted earnings per share using the fully diluted shares for fiscal we used the fiscal denominator for the calculation because the fiscal fully diluted share count was substantially different and therefore not comparable due to the chs transactions  and we believe that using the fiscal fully diluted shares offers a more meaningful comparison to fiscal 
table of contents recent developments in april  we opened a new manufacturing building at our primary production facility in san marcos  texas 
the expansion was completed over the course of one year at an approximate cost of million 
the new manufacturing building has approximately  square feet of floor space  including offices 
in addition to purchasing new manufacturing equipment  we have moved certain of our existing manufacturing lines to the new building  which we believe will create efficiencies in the cable production process 
the new manufacturing building will enable us to approximately double production capacity for our low temperature cables  as well as increase our high temperature cable production capacity by approximately 
we currently estimate that the facility expansion  when operating at full capacity  will support revenue levels of up to to million 
this should satisfy our core cable growth needs for the next several years  assuming that current trends in product mix continue 
on june   tgh filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s under the securities act relating to the possible offering and sale  from time to time  in one or more offerings and at prices and on terms that will be determined at the time of any such offering  i by us of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units for an aggregate initial offering price up to  and ii by our private equity sponsors and certain of our current and former executive officers  employees and directors of up to  shares of our common stock 
no securities may be sold under the shelf registration statement until it has been declared effective by the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures include the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
foreign currency risk relating to operations 
we transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with fluctuating foreign exchange rates 
approximately of our fiscal consolidated revenue was generated by sales from our non us subsidiaries 
our non us subsidiaries generally sell their products and services in the local currency  but obtain a significant amount of their products from our facilities located in another country  primarily the united states  canada or europe 
significant changes in the relevant exchange rates could adversely affect our margins on foreign sales of products 
our non us subsidiaries incur most of their expenses other than intercompany expenses in their local functional currency 
these currencies include the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  russian ruble  australian dollar  south korean won  chinese renminbi  indian rupee  mexican peso  and japanese yen 
during fiscal  we established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes nor do we designate these forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to asc we adjust the carrying amount of all contracts to their fair value at the end of each reporting period and unrealized gains and losses are included in our results of operations for that period 
these gains and losses largely offset gains and losses resulting from settlement of payments received from our foreign operations which are settled in us dollars 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in miscellaneous expense 
the fair value is determined by quoted prices on identical forward contracts level fair value 
the balance sheet reflects unrealized gains within prepaid expenses and other current assets and unrealized losses within accrued liabilities 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
as of march  and  the notional amounts of forward contracts we held to sell us dollars in exchange for other major international currencies were  and zero  respectively 
during fiscal  our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates consisted primarily of the canadian dollar and the euro against the us dollar 
the market risk related to the foreign currency exchange rates is measured by estimating the potential impact of a change in the value of the us dollar relative to the local currency exchange rates 
the rates used to perform this analysis were based on a weighted average of the market rates in effect during the relevant period 
a appreciation of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a net decrease in net income of million for fiscal conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a net increase in net income of million for fiscal a appreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a net decrease in net income of million for fiscal 
table of contents conversely  a depreciation of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in a net increase in net income of million for fiscal the geographic areas outside the united states in which we operate are generally not considered to be highly inflationary 
nonetheless  these foreign operations are sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates arising from  among other things  certain intercompany transactions that are generally denominated in us dollars rather than their respective functional currencies 
the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for fiscal was a million loss compared to a loss of million in fiscal in order to meet our global cash management needs  we often transfer cash between the us and foreign entities and on occasion between foreign entities 
in addition  our debt service requirements are primarily in us dollars and a substantial portion of our cash flow is generated in foreign currencies  and we may need to repatriate cash to the united states in order to meet our us debt service obligations  including on our senior secured notes 
these transfers of cash expose us to currency exchange rate risks  and significant changes in the value of the foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could limit our ability to meet our debt obligations and impair our financial condition 
because our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars  and we generate a substantial amount of our sales and earnings in other currencies  the translation of those results into us dollars can result in a significant decrease in the amount of those sales and earnings 
in addition  fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparisons of our reported results of operations 
at each balance sheet date  we translate our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency to us dollars 
the balances of our foreign equity accounts are translated at their historical value 
the difference between the current rates and the historical rates are posted to our currency translation account and reflected in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
the unrealized effect of foreign currency translation was a loss of million in fiscal  compared to a gain of million in fiscal currency translation gains or losses are reported as part of comprehensive income or loss in the notes to the accompanying audited condensed consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk and foreign currency risk relating to debt 
the interest rate for the senior secured notes is fixed at while any borrowings on our revolving credit facility will incur interest expense that is variable in relation to the libor rate 
at march   the interest rate on amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility was 
based on our average outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility during fiscal  a one percentage point increase or decrease in our interest rate would result in a net increase or decrease  respectively  of our annual interest expense of approximately  the senior secured notes are denominated and payable in the us dollar 
approximately of our consolidated revenue was generated in foreign currency in fiscal  therefore  we expect to have to repatriate our cash earnings in foreign locations in order to make principal reductions on the senior secured notes 
in the event that the us dollar strengthens relative to the foreign currencies we are repatriating to make principal repayments  we may incur exchange rate losses that are larger than those that we have reported historically 
commodity price risk 
we use various commodity based raw materials in our manufacturing processes 
generally  we acquire such components at market prices and do not typically enter into long term purchase commitments with suppliers or hedging instruments to mitigate commodity price risk 
as a result  we are subject to market risks related to changes in commodity prices and supplies of key components of our products 
historically  the costs of our primary raw materials have been stable and readily available from multiple suppliers 
typically  we have been able to pass on raw material cost increases to our customers 
we cannot provide any assurance  however  that we may be able to pass along such cost increases to our customers or source sufficient amounts of key components on commercially reasonable terms or at all in the future  and if we are unable to do so  our results of operations may be adversely affected
