general we currently operate the great golden lake tourist destination global geo park  hua an tulou cluster or the earth buildings tourist destination world culture heritage  and yunding recreational park large scale national recreational park  covering over square kilometers in total 
our media business provides operating management service  including channel and advertisement management for the fetv since and the journey through china on the train on board railway program railway media 
as of december   we  through our wholly owned subsidiaries in china  have entered into four additional cooperation agreements respectively with the local chinese government agents  namely  i the anhui province bengbu municipal government  ii the jiangxi province zhangshu municipal government  iii the fenyi county  xinyu city  jiangxi province government  and iv the fujian education media limited company  a wholly state owned company organized by the fujian education television station fetv

we expect that our tourism business will be the primary source of our revenue over the next few years 
advertising business has been our primary source of revenue for the last two year because the tourism business has experienced the serious flooding and weather and the ads restriction was not executed by the local government 
the revenue from advertising will decrease because of the new restriction on the advertisement and we expect that the revenue from tourism will increase 
however  any increase in revenue will depend on the recovery of great golden lake and the progress we make in our other tourist destinations 
this expectation is also based on our new projects and construction of tourism destinations 
last year we experienced a significant flood at the great golden lake which resulted in a sharp decrease of revenue because we had to close the park 
it has taken a considerable amount of time for the natural beauty to be restored after the flood but we believe that the great golden lake has started to recover and visitors will return to the park 
flooding does not occur on a regular basis either at the great golden lake or in the province and we do not expect to see additional floods or other natural disasters affect our operations in the future 
in  at great golden lake and at hua an tulou  we do not anticipate much new construction as we are maintaining our existing operations and restoring what is already built and in operation 
we do not expect any construction or restoration to affect our operations 
our advertising and tourism businesses are not seasonal 
we have visitors to our parks throughout the year 
overview advertising business for the advertising business  our advertising revenue is driven by the popularity of our television programs and the number of viewers tuning into our television station 
if more people tune into our station  we will be able to attract more advertisers and charge more for each advertising spot 
this will increase our revenues 
we strive to keep our audience rating high in order to be able to sell all our advertising air time 
we generate our advertising revenue by selling air time to sponsors and companies that are interested in marketing their products to our television viewers 
we incur administrative fees  business traveling fees  salaries  depreciation  automobile and interest costs in operating the advertising business 
the new prc regulations set forth by the state administration for radio  film and television which bans certain television and radio advertisements has had a negative effect on our revenues and certain clients have not continued to advertise 
accordingly  we expect our revenues to decline 
tourism business for the tourism business  our revenue is driven by the reputation of our tourist destinations 
we strive to offer quality tourist attractions that offer our visitors diverse entertainment  including catering  hotel  transportation and shopping 
we generate our revenue from our visitors and tourists who are looking to enjoy our tourist location 
we incur many costs associated with operating the tourist business  including  administration fees  business traveling fees  land use rights fees  and revenue sharing fees 
we entered into tourism management revenue sharing agreement with the taining government with respect to the great golden lake resort 
we have contracted to share the revenue over the course of the agreement as follows i from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  ii from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  iii from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  iv from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  v from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue  and vi from to we will receive of the revenue and the taining government will receive of the revenue 
because of the decreasing revenue share that we will receive from the great golden lake resort and the resort has not been fully recovered to its previous level due to the flood  we may not be able to maintain our revenues from great golden lake 
however  with the recovery of great golden lake and the expected grand openings of three new tourism projects in the future  we believe that we will be able to generate more revenues in order to maintain the high gross profit margins in the tourism segment 
we do expect our tourism business to be our primary source of revenue over the next few years 
although ming dynasty  yang sheng paradise and city of caves are not yet operating  we do expect them to be opened by the end of and to start generating revenue by also  we expect yunding to continue to grow and for the great golden lake to recover from the flooding

critical accounting policies basis of presentation the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the preparation of our financial statements 
these accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of china yida and its wholly owned subsidiaries keenway limited  hong kong yi tat  fujian jintai  fuyu  hongda  fujian yida  tulou  anhui yida  yongtai yunding  jiangxi zhangshu  jiangxi fenyi  yida travel and the accounts of its variable interest entity  fujian jiaoguang 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
consolidation of variable interest entities according to the requirements of asc  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
that requires a variable interest entity vie  the company has evaluated the economic relationships of fujian jiaoguang which signed an exclusive right agreement with the company 
therefore  fujian jiaoguang is considered to be a vie  as defined by asc topic  of which the company is the primary beneficiary 
use of estimates and assumptions the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  actual results could differ materially from those results 
the most significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements include depreciation  useful lives of property and equipment  deferred income taxes  useful life of intangible assets and contingencies 
estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal 
the cost of improvements that extends the life of property  and equipment are capitalized 
these capitalized costs may include structural improvements  equipment  and fixtures 
all ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease term as follows building years electronic equipment to years transportation equipment years office furniture to years leasehold improvement and attractions lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets intangible assets intangible assets consist of acquisition of management right of tourist resort  commercial airtime rights and land use rights for tourism resorts 
they are amortized on the straight line basis over their respective lease periods 
the lease period of management right  commercial airtime rights and land use rights is years  years and years  respectively 
impairment the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
assets are grouped and evaluated at the lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows  the company measures the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
the estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows as the rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
the company estimates fair value based on the information available  judgments and projections are considered necessary 
there was no impairment of long lived assets as of december  and revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the date of service rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the services rendered  no other significant obligations of the company exist and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue 
revenues from advance resort ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used 
revenues from our contractors who have tourism contracts with us are generally recognized over the period of the applicable agreements commencing with the tourists visiting the resort 
the company also sells admission and activities tickets for a resort which the company has the management right 
the company sells the television airtime to third parties 
the company records advertising sales when advertisements are aired 
the company has no allowance for product returns or sales discounts because services that are rendered and accepted by the customers are normally not refundable and discounts are normally not granted after service has been rendered 
profit sharing costs are recorded as cost of revenue 
foreign currency translation the company uses the united states dollar us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the company s subsidiaries maintain their books and records in their functional currency  being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted 
in general  for consolidation purposes  the company translates the subsidiaries assets and liabilities into us dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates  and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods 
gain or loss on foreign currency transactions are reflected on the income statement 
gain or loss on financial statement translation from foreign currency are recorded as a separate component in the equity section of the balance sheet and is included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the functional currency of the company and its subsidiaries in china is the chinese renminbi 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company applied the provisions of asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides clarification related to the process associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements 
audit periods remain open for review until the statute of limitations has passed 
the completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given audit period could result in an adjustment to the company s liability for income taxes 
any such adjustment could be material to the company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based  in part  upon the results of operations for the given period 
at december   management considered that the company had no uncertain tax positions  and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future 
fair values of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements for current assets and currently liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these financial instruments 
the carrying amount of long term loans approximates fair value since the interest rate associated with the debt approximates the current market interest rate 
the company adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements for both financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
this standard defines fair value  provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures 
this standard does not require any new fair value measurements  but discusses valuation techniques  such as the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flows and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
for purposes of asc  nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities would include all assets and liabilities other than those meeting the definition of a financial asset or financial liability as defined in asc a 
stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation expense pursuant to asc  share based payment arrangement  which requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the company s expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of company s stock or the expected volatility of similar entities 
the expected life assumption is primarily based on historical exercise patterns and employee post vesting termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
stock based compensation expense is recognized based on awards expected to vest  and there were no estimated forfeitures as the company has a short history of issuing options 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised in subsequent periods  if necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income asu 
deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
among the new provisions in asu was a requirement for entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements  however this reclassification requirement is indefinitely deferred by asu and will be further deliberated by the fasb at a future date 
in september  the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu is intended to simplify how entities  both public and nonpublic  test goodwill and other intangible assets such as patents for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 
asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september   if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued or  for nonpublic entities  have not yet been made available for issuance 
the company does not expect the adoption of asu to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements

 presentation of comprehensive income  an amendment to asc topic  comprehensive income 
under this amendment  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the guidance for public entities is effective for fiscal years or interim periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the amendments in this update are to be applied retrospectively
