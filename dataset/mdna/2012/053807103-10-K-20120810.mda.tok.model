item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii of this form k for additional information on acquisitions completed during fiscal  and major products one of avnet s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products it distributes 
ibm products accounted for approximately  and of the company s consolidated sales during fiscal  and  respectively  and was the only supplier from which sales of its products exceeded of consolidated sales 
listed in the table below are the major product categories and the company s approximate sales of each during the past three fiscal years years ended june  july  july  millions semiconductors computer products connectors passives  electromechanical and other 
table of contents competition markets avnet is one of the world s largest industrial distributors  based on sales  of electronic components and computer products and services 
the company has more than locations worldwide as well as a limited number of instances where avnet owned product is stored in customer facilities 
some of these locations contain sales  warehousing and administrative functions for multiple sales and marketing units 
the electronic components and computer products industries continue to be extremely competitive and are subject to rapid technological advances 
the company s major competitors include arrow electronics  inc  future electronics and world peace group  and  to a lesser extent  ingram micro  inc and tech data corp 
there are also certain smaller  specialized competitors who generally focus on narrower markets  products or particular sectors 
as a result of these factors  avnet must remain competitive in its pricing of goods and services 
another key competitive factor in the electronic component and computer product distribution industry is the need to carry a sufficient amount of inventory to meet customers rapid delivery requirements 
however  to minimize its exposure related to valuation of inventory on hand  the majority of the company s products are purchased pursuant to non exclusive distributor agreements 
these agreements typically provide certain protections for product obsolescence and price erosion and are generally cancelable upon to days notice 
in most cases  these agreements provide for inventory return privileges upon cancellation 
in addition  the company enhances its competitive position by offering a variety of value added services which entail the performance of services and or processes tailored to individual customer specifications and business needs such as point of use replenishment  testing  assembly  supply chain management and materials management 
another competitive advantage is the size of the supplier base 
because of the number of avnet s suppliers  many customers can simplify their procurement process and make all of their required purchases from avnet  rather than purchasing from several different vendors 
seasonality historically  avnet s business has not been materially impacted by seasonality  with the exception of a relatively minor impact on consolidated results from the growth in revenues in the technology solutions business during the december quarter primarily driven by the fiscal year end of a key supplier 
number of employees at june   avnet had approximately  employees

item a 
risk factors forward looking statements and risk factors this report contains forward looking statements with respect to the financial condition  results of operations and business of avnet 
these statements are generally identified by words like believes  expects  anticipates  should  will  may  estimates or similar expressions 
forward looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
except as required by law  avnet does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements include the following economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our results and prospects 
the company s results  operations and prospects depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions  the demand for its products and services  and the financial condition of its customers and suppliers 
economic weakness and uncertainty  including the ongoing macroeconomic issues in many countries globally and the debt crisis in europe and the united states  have in the past resulted  and may result in the future  in decreased revenues  margins and earnings 
economic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for the company to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables  which may result in reduced access to liquidity and higher financing costs 
the electronics component and computer industries are highly competitive and if the company fails to compete effectively  its revenues  gross profit margins and prospects may decline 
the market for the company s products and services is very competitive and subject to rapid technological advances  changes in industry standards and changes in customer needs 
not only does the company compete with other global distributors  it also competes for customers with regional distributors and some of the company s own suppliers 
the company s failure to maintain and enhance its competitive position could adversely affect its business and prospects 
furthermore  the company s efforts to compete in the marketplace could cause deterioration of gross profit margins and  thus  overall profitability 
the size of the company s competitors vary across market sectors  as do the resources the company has allocated to the sectors and geographic areas in which it does business 
therefore  some of the competitors may have greater financial  personnel  capacity and other resources or a more extensive customer base than the company has in one or more of its market sectors and geographic areas  which may result in the company not being able to effectively compete in certain markets which could impact the company s profitability and prospects 

table of contents an industry down cycle in semiconductors could significantly affect the company s operating results as a large portion of revenues come from sales of semiconductors  which is a highly cyclical industry 
the semiconductor industry historically has experienced periodic fluctuations in product supply and demand  often associated with changes in technology and manufacturing capacity  and is generally considered to be highly cyclical 
during each of the last three fiscal years  sales of semiconductors represented over of the company s consolidated sales  and the company s revenues  particularly those of em  closely follow the strength or weakness of the semiconductor market 
future downturns in the technology industry  particularly in the semiconductor sector  could negatively affect the company s operating results and negatively impact the company s ability to maintain its current profitability levels 
failure to maintain its relationships with key suppliers could adversely affect the company s sales 
one of the company s competitive strengths is the breadth and quality of the suppliers whose products the company distributes 
however  sales of products and services from one of the company s suppliers  ibm  accounted for approximately of the company s consolidated sales in fiscal year management expects ibm products and services to continue to account for roughly a similar percentage of the company s consolidated sales in fiscal year the company s contracts with its suppliers  including those with ibm  vary in duration and are generally terminable by either party at will upon notice 
to the extent ibm or other primary suppliers significantly reduce their volume of business with the company in the future  because of a product shortage  an unwillingness to do business with avnet  or otherwise  the company s business and relationships with its customers could be materially and adversely affected because its customers depend on the company s distribution of electronic components and computer products from the industry s leading suppliers 
in addition  to the extent that any of the company s key suppliers modify the terms of their contracts including  without limitation  the terms regarding price protection  rights of return  rebates or other terms that protect or enhance the company s gross margins  it could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
declines in the value of the company s inventory or unexpected order cancellations by the company s customers could materially and adversely affect its business  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity 
the electronic components and computer products industries are subject to rapid technological change  new and enhanced products  changes in customer needs and changes in industry standards  which can contribute to a decline in value or obsolescence of inventory 
regardless of the general economic environment  it is possible that prices will decline due to a decrease in demand or an oversupply of products and  as a result of the price declines  there may be greater risk of declines in inventory value 
although it is the policy of many of the company s suppliers to offer distributors like avnet certain protections from the loss in value of inventory such as price protection and limited rights of return  the company cannot be assured that such policies will fully compensate for the loss in value  or that the vendors will choose to  or be able to  honor such agreements  some of which are not documented and  therefore  subject to the discretion of the vendor 
in addition  the company s sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  and the company generally does not have long term supply arrangements with its customers 
generally  the company s customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment with minimal penalties 
the company cannot be assured that unforeseen new product developments  declines in the value of the company s inventory or unforeseen order cancellations by its customers will not materially and adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
substantial defaults by the company s customers on its accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
a significant portion of the company s working capital consists of accounts receivable from customers 
if customers responsible for a significant amount of accounts receivable were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay the amount it owes the company  or were to become unwilling or unable to make such payments in a timely manner  the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity could be adversely affected 
an economic or industry downturn could adversely and materially affect the servicing of these accounts receivable  which could result in longer payment cycles  increased collection costs and defaults in excess of management s expectations 
a significant deterioration in the company s ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under its accounts receivable securitization program see financing transactions appearing in item of this report 

table of contents the company s non us locations represent a significant portion of its revenue  and consequently  the company is increasingly exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
during fiscal year  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s sales came from its operations outside the united states 
as a result of the company s foreign sales and locations  in particular those in emerging and developing economies  the company s operations are subject to a variety of risks that are specific to international operations  including  but not limited to  the following potential restrictions on the company s ability to repatriate funds from its foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations and the impact on the company s reported results of operations  import and export duties and value added taxes  compliance with foreign and domestic import and export regulations  business licensing requirements and anti corruption laws  the failure of which could result in severe penalties including monetary fines  criminal proceedings and suspension of import or export privileges  changing tax laws and regulations  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  economic and political instability  terrorism and potential military conflicts or civilian unrest  fluctuations in freight costs  limitations on shipping and receiving capacity  and other disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure  natural disasters and health concerns  differing environmental regulations and employment practices and labor issues  and the risk of non compliance with local laws 
in addition to the cost of compliance  the potential criminal penalties for violations of export regulations and anti corruption laws  particularly anti bribery  data privacy laws and environmental laws and regulations in many jurisdictions  create heightened risks for the company s international operations 
in the event that a governing regulatory body determined that the company had violated applicable import or export regulations or anti corruption laws  the company could be fined significant sums  incur sizable legal defense costs and or its import or export capabilities could be restricted  which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business 
while the company has and will continue to adopt measures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  the company cannot be assured that such measures will be adequate or that its business will not be materially and adversely impacted in the event of an alleged violation 
the company s acquisition strategy may not produce the expected benefits  which may adversely affect the company s results of operations 
avnet has made  and expects to continue to make  strategic acquisitions or investments in companies around the world to further its strategic objectives and support key business initiatives 
acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties  some of which may differ from those associated with avnet s historical operations 
the risks relating to such transactions include  but are not limited to  risks relating to expanding into emerging markets and business areas  adding additional product lines and services  incurring unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the companies acquired and diverting management s attention from existing business operations 
as a result  the company s profitability may be negatively impacted 
in addition  the company may not be successful in integrating the acquired businesses or the integration may be more difficult  costly or time consuming than anticipated 
further  any litigation relating to a potential acquisition will result in an increase in the expenses associated with the acquisition or cause a delay in completing the acquisition  thereby impacting the company s profitability 
the company may experience disruptions that could  depending on the size of the acquisition  have a material adverse effect on its business  especially where an acquisition target may have pre existing non compliance or pre existing deficiencies or material weaknesses as those terms are defined under relevant sec rules and regulations 
furthermore  the company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from its acquisitions  which could materially and adversely affect the company s financial performance 

table of contents if the company fails to maintain effective internal controls  it may not be able to report its financial results accurately or timely or detect fraud  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or the market price of the company s securities 
effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud 
if the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud  its brand and operating results could be harmed 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls cannot provide absolute assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation  the company s business and operating results could be harmed  and the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on its business or the market price of the company s securities 
if the company s internal information systems fail to function properly  or if the company is unsuccessful in the integration or upgrade of information systems  its business operations could suffer 
the company s expanding operations put increasing pressure on the company s information systems to facilitate the day to day operations of the business and to produce timely  accurate and reliable reports on financial and operational results 
currently  the company s global operations are tracked with multiple information systems  some of which are subject to on going it projects designed to streamline or optimize its global information systems 
there is no guarantee that the company will be successful at all times in these efforts or that there will not be integration difficulties that will adversely affect the company s operations or the accurate and timely recording and reporting of financial data 
in addition  the company s information technology is subject to security breaches  computer hacking or other general system failures 
maintaining and operating these systems requires continuous investments 
a data privacy breach may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public 
a failure of any of these information systems in a way described above or material difficulties in upgrading these information systems could have material adverse effects on the company s business and its compliance with reporting obligations under federal securities laws 
major disruptions to the company s logistics capability could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations 
the company s global logistics services are operated through specialized and centralized distribution centers around the globe 
the company also depends almost entirely on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to its customers 
a major interruption or disruption in service at one or more of its distribution centers for any reason such as natural disasters  pandemics  or significant disruptions of services from our third party providers could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and  as a result  could have a severe impact on the company s business  operations and financial performance 
the company may not have adequate or cost effective liquidity or capital resources 
the company s ability to satisfy its cash needs depends on its ability to generate cash from operations and to access the financial markets  both of which are subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond the company s control 
the company may need to satisfy its cash needs through external financing 
however  external financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
as of june   avnet had total debt outstanding of billion under various notes and committed and uncommitted lines of credit with financial institutions 
the company needs cash to make interest payments on  and to refinance  this indebtedness and for general corporate purposes  such as funding its ongoing working capital and capital expenditure needs 
under the terms of any external financing  the company may incur higher than expected financing expenses and become subject to additional restrictions and covenants 
any material increase in the company s financing costs could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 

table of contents under certain of its credit facilities  the company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet certain tests 
if the company fails to meet these financial ratios and or tests  it may be unable to continue to utilize these facilities 
if the company is unable to utilize these facilities  it may not have sufficient cash available to make interest payments on and refinance indebtedness and for general corporate needs 
general economic or business conditions  domestic and foreign  may be less favorable than management expects and could adversely impact the company s sales or its ability to collect receivables from its customers  which may impact access to the company s securitization program 
the agreements governing some of the company s financings contain various covenants and restrictions that limit the discretion of management in operating its business and could prevent us from engaging in some activities that may be beneficial to the company s business 
the agreements governing the company s financing  including its credit facility and the indentures governing the company s outstanding notes  contain various covenants and restrictions that  in certain circumstances  limit the company s ability  and the ability of certain subsidiaries  to grant liens on assets  make restricted payments including paying dividends on capital stock or redeeming or repurchasing capital stock  make investments  merge  consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of the company s assets  incur additional debt  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates 
as a result of these covenants and restrictions  the company may be limited in the future in how it conducts its business and may be unable to raise additional debt  compete effectively or make further investments 
the company may become involved in intellectual property disputes that could cause it to incur substantial costs  divert the efforts of management or require it to pay substantial damages or licensing fees 
from time to time  the company receives notifications alleging infringements of intellectual property rights allegedly held by others relating to the company s business or the products or services it sells 
litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property matters could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and other resources and could have an adverse effect on the company s operations 
further  the company may be obligated to indemnify and defend its customers if the products or services the company sells are alleged to infringe any third party s intellectual property rights 
while the company may be able to seek indemnification from its suppliers for itself and its customers against such claims  there is no assurance that it will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that the company will be fully protected against such claims 
if an infringement claim is successful  the company may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
the company may have to stop selling certain products or services  which could affect its ability to compete effectively 
failure to comply with the requirements of environmental regulations could adversely affect its business 
the company is subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations addressing environmental and other impacts from product disposal  use of hazardous materials in products  recycling of products at the end of their useful life and other related matters 
while the company strives to ensure it is in full compliance with all applicable regulations  certain of these regulations impose liability without fault 
additionally  the company may be held responsible for the prior activities of an entity it acquired 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in substantial costs  fines and civil or criminal sanctions  as well as third party claims for property damage or personal injury 
further  environmental laws may become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violation 

table of contents tax legislation initiatives or challenges to the company s tax positions could impact the company s results of operations and financial condition 
as a multinational corporation  the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal  state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions 
from time to time  legislation may be enacted that could adversely affect the company s tax positions 
there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate and the resulting cash flow will not be adversely affected by these changes in regulations 
the tax laws and regulations of the various countries where the company has operations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
although the company believes that its historical tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws  regulations and existing precedent  there can be no assurance that these tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that the company would be successful in any such challenge

for example  under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla and similar state laws  avnet is and may be liable for the costs of cleaning up environmental contamination on or from certain of its current or former properties  and at off site locations where the company disposed of wastes in the past 
such laws may impose joint and several liability 
typically  however  the costs for cleanup at such sites are allocated among potentially responsible parties based upon each party s relative contribution to the contamination  and other factors 
pursuant to sec regulations  including but not limited to item of regulation s k  the company regularly assesses the status of and developments in pending environmental legal proceedings to determine whether any such proceedings should be identified specifically in this discussion of legal proceedings  and has concluded that no particular pending environmental legal proceeding requires public disclosure 
based on the information known to date  management believes that the company has appropriately accrued in its consolidated financial statements for its share of the estimated costs of environmental matters 

table of contents the company is also party to various other lawsuits  claims  investigations and other legal proceedings arising from time to time in the normal course of business 
while litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  liquidity or results of operations

the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance which requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash or other assets on conversion to separately account for the debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the standard requires the convertible debt to be recognized at the present value of its cash flows discounted using the non convertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance 
the resulting debt discount from this present value calculation is to be recognized as the value of the equity component and recorded to additional paid in capital 
the discounted convertible debt is then required to be accreted up to its face value and recorded as non cash interest expense over the expected life of the convertible debt 
in addition  deferred financing costs associated with the convertible debt are required to be allocated between the debt and equity components based upon relative values 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company adopted this standard  however  there was no impact to the fiscal consolidated financial statements because the company s convertible senior debentures  to which this standard applied  were extinguished in fiscal due to the required retrospective application of this standard to prior periods  the company adjusted the prior period comparative consolidated financial statements

the fiscal effective tax rate is higher than the fiscal effective tax rate primarily due to a lower amount of tax reserve released in fiscal as compared with the amount released in fiscal  as discussed further below  and  to a lesser extent  a more favorable impact from audit settlements and changes to existing tax positions in fiscal as compared with fiscal these favorable impacts were partially offset by the withholding tax mentioned above 
prior to fiscal  the company had a full reserve against significant tax assets related to a legal entity in emea due to  among several other factors  a history of losses in that entity 
in each of fiscal and  the company determined a portion of the tax reserve related to this entity was no longer required due to the expected continuation of improved earnings in the foreseeable future and  as a result  the company s effective tax rate was positively impacted decreased upon the release of the tax reserves

the company will continue to evaluate the need for a reserve against the tax assets associated with this legal entity and will adjust the reserve as deemed appropriate which  when adjusted  will result in an impact to the effective tax rate

the fiscal effective tax rate was impacted primarily by changes to estimates for existing tax positions and net favorable tax audit settlements  offset by a reserve established against certain deferred tax assets 
avnet s effective tax rate is primarily a function of the tax rates in the numerous jurisdictions in which it does business applied to the mix of pre tax book income 
the effective tax rate may vary year over year as a result of changes in tax requirements in these jurisdictions  management s evaluation of its ability to generate sufficient taxable income to offset net operating loss carry forwards and the establishment of reserves for unfavorable outcomes of tax positions taken on certain matters that are common to multinational enterprises and the actual outcome of those matters 
the company is in the final stages of two audits by the us internal revenue service  one of which relates to the company and one relates to the pre acquisition period of an acquired entity 
as a result  it is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months  the company may record a tax benefit of million to million  which would favorably impact the effective tax rate in the period in which the matter is effectively settled 
this estimated benefit is comprised primarily of the recognition of additional net operating losses as well as the release of related reserves  partially offset by unfavorable audit adjustments 
net income as a result of the factors described in the preceding sections of this md a  the company s net income in fiscal was million  or per share on a diluted basis  as compared with net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal and million  or per share on a diluted basis  in fiscal fiscal  and results were impacted by certain items as presented in the following tables year ended june  operating income loss pre tax income loss net income loss diluted eps thousands  except per share data restructuring  integration and other charges gain on bargain purchase and other net tax benefit total year ended july  operating income loss pre tax income loss net income loss diluted eps thousands  except per share data restructuring  integration and other charges gain on bargain purchase and other release of tax valuation allowance  net of tax reserves adjustments total

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to change  management would evaluate whether additional adjustments are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets wherein such inventories may be subject to technological obsolescence 
the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those currently estimated 
accounting for income taxes management s judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
similarly  should the company determine that it is able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets that have been reserved for  the company may release a valuation allowance with a corresponding benefit to income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
in determining the company s effective tax rate  management considers current tax regulations in the numerous jurisdictions in which it operates  and requires management s judgment for interpretation and application 
changes to such tax regulations or disagreements with the company s interpretation or application by tax authorities in any of the company s major jurisdictions may have a significant impact on the company s provision for income taxes 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing goodwill for impairment  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
the company is also required to make judgments regarding the evaluation of changes in events or circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  the results of which would determine whether an interim impairment test must be performed 
should these assumptions or judgments change in the future based upon market conditions or should the structure of the company s reporting units change based upon changes in business strategy  the company may be required to perform an interim impairment test which may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during fiscal  and  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test and determined there was no goodwill impairment in any of its reporting units 
the company does not believe there were any reporting units that were at risk of failing step of the goodwill impairment test 
however  there were two reporting units for which the estimated fair value was not substantially in excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit  specifically ts asia and ts emea 
the percentage by which the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value was approximately and for ts asia and ts emea  respectively 
in addition  as of june   ts asia and ts emea had approximately million and million  respectively  of allocated goodwill 
in order to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  the company uses a combination of an income approach  specifically a discounted cash flow methodology  and a market approach 
the discounted cash flow methodology includes assumptions for  among others  forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating profit margins  working capital cash flow  perpetual growth rates and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments and estimates by management which are inherently uncertain 
these assumptions  judgments and estimates may change in the future based upon market conditions or other events and could result in a goodwill impairment charge  in particular  in the ts asia and ts emea reporting units 
contingencies and litigation from time to time  the company may become a party to  or otherwise involved in  various lawsuits  claims  investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of conducting its business 
while litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  management does not anticipate that any current matters will have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business because revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized in income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

cash generated by working capital in fiscal resulted from a decrease in receivables and inventory of million and million  respectively  offset by a decrease in payables of million and in accrued expenses and other of million 
em drove the decrease in receivables and inventory which more than offset the increase in receivables at ts

cash balances generated and held in foreign locations are used for on going working capital  capital expenditures and to support acquisitions 
these balances are currently expected to be permanently reinvested outside the us if these funds were needed in the us  the company would incur significant income taxes to repatriate cash held in foreign locations to the extent they are in excess of outstanding intercompany loans due to avnet  inc from the foreign subsidiaries

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company seeks to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates by entering into financial arrangements  from time to time  which are intended to provide a hedge against all or a portion of the risks associated with such volatility 
the company continues to have exposure to such risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities of the company s debt outstanding at june  dollars in millions fiscal year thereafter total liabilities fixed rate debt floating rate debt excludes discounts on long term notes 
the following table sets forth the carrying value and fair value of the company s debt at june  dollars in millions carrying value at june  fair value at june  carrying value at july  fair value at july  liabilities fixed rate debt average interest rate floating rate debt average interest rate excludes discounts on long term notes 
many of the company s subsidiaries  on occasion  purchase and sell products in currencies other than their functional currencies 
this subjects the company to the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company reduces this risk by utilizing natural hedging offsetting receivables and payables as well as by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts with maturities of less than sixty days 
the company continues to have exposure to foreign currency risks to the extent they are not hedged 
the company adjusts all foreign denominated balances and any outstanding foreign exchange contracts to fair market value through the consolidated statements of operations 
therefore  the market risk related to foreign exchange contracts is offset by changes in valuation of the underlying items being hedged 
the asset or liability representing the fair value of foreign exchange contracts is classified in the captions other current assets or accrued expenses and other  as applicable  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
a hypothetical change in currency exchange rates under the contracts outstanding at june  would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts  which would generally be offset by an opposite effect on the related hedged positions
