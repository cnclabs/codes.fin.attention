in addition  through jintai and yuxing  we develop and produce agricultural products  such as top grade fruits  vegetables  flowers and colored seedlings 
for financial reporting purposes  our operations are organized into four business segments fertilizer products jinong  fertilizer products gufeng  agricultural products production jintai  and agricultural products production yuxing 
jintai and yuxing also serve as a research and development base for our fertilizer products 
the fertilizer business conducted by jinong and gufeng generated approximately  and of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended june   and  respectively 
it should be noted that our consolidated results for the period do not include the results of gufeng and its subsidiary  tianjuyuan  which were acquired on july  fertilizer products as of june   we had developed and produced a total of different fertilizer products in use  of which and were developed and produced by jinong and gufeng  respectively

jintai s relocation we have started to relocate jintai to the facilities of one of the company s other subsidiaries yuxing  located in hu county  xi an 
yuxing s facilities are approximately a one hour drive south of jintai s current location in the economic and technical development zone the zone in the metro area of the city of xi an 
as mentioned in the company s previous quarterly reports  with the rapid growth of urbanization in xi an  the zone has been inhabited by a large and dense population and the periphery of jintai has bristled with various industrial factories and utility plants 
the zone s concentrated industrial activities and dense population changed the micro bioenvironment for the growth of jintai s agricultural products and disturbed jintai s normal fertilizer research and development 
recently such changes caused the death and obsolescence of large amount of jintai s flowers and seedlings 
additionally  the government recently introduced a new rezoning plan for the zone  and the land jintai currently occupies is being converted from agriculture use to residential and commercial use 
the rezoning will prohibit the agricultural growth activities that jintai currently conducts at the property 
to continue jintai s business  the company will relocate all of jintai s operations  including greenhouses  inventories  growing seedlings  flowers and parent plants  to yuxing 
the relocation commenced on march  and the entire relocation process is expected to complete by the end of fiscal year further  we may consider merging the subsidiaries of yuxing and jintai together to reduce operating cost and streamline management at appropriate time in the future

discussion of segment profitability measures as of june   we were engaged in the following businesses the production and sale of fertilizers through jinong and gufeng and the production and sale of high quality agricultural products by jintai and yuxing 
for financial reporting purposes  our operations were organized into four main business segments based on location and product jinong fertilizer production  gufeng fertilizer production  jintai agricultural products production and yuxing agricultural products production 
each of the segments has its own annual budget with regard to development  production and sales 
each of the four operating segments referenced above has separate and distinct general ledgers 
the chief operating decision maker codm receives financial information  including revenue  gross margin  operating income and net income produced from the various general ledger systems to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance  however  the principal measure of segment profitability or loss used by the codm is net income by segment 
for jinong  the net income increased by  to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year  while its net income increased by  to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year for gufeng  the net income increased by  to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year for yuxing  the net loss decreased by  to  for the fiscal year from  for the fiscal year  while its net loss increased by  to a net loss of  for the fiscal year from a net loss of  for the fiscal year for jintai  the net loss increased  by  to  for the fiscal year from the net loss of  for the fiscal year  while it net income decreased by  to a net loss of  for the fiscal year from a net profit of  for the fiscal year the loss incurred by jintai in fiscal year was primarily due to its relocation 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity include cash from operations  borrowings from local commercial banks and net proceeds of offerings of our securities consummated in july and november december collectively the public offerings 
as of june   cash and cash equivalents were  an increase of  and  or and  respectively  from  and  as of june  and  respectively 
we intend to use some of the remaining net proceeds from the public offerings approximately million  as well as other working capital if required  to acquire new businesses  upgrade production lines and complete yuxing s new greenhouse facilities for agriculture products located on acres of land in hu county  kilometers southeast of xi an city 
we believe that we have sufficient cash on hand and positive projected cash flow from operations to support our business growth for the next twelve months to the extent we do not have further significant acquisitions or expansions 
however  if events or circumstances occur and we do not meet our operating plan as expected  we may be required to seek additional capital and or to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we may seek additional financing as necessary for expansion purposes and when we believe market conditions are most advantageous  which may include additional debt and or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any equity financing may result in dilution to existing stockholders and any debt financing may include restrictive covenants 
the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated fiscal year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities  effect of exchange rate change on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents   cash and cash equivalents  beginning balance  cash and cash equivalents  ending balance  operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of  or  and an increase of  or  respectively  from  and  net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the increased credit sales by gufeng during the fiscal year ended june   which was part of gufeng s warehouse selling 
to retain and expand gufeng s market share  gufeng enhanced its warehouse selling and increased the credit sales for gufeng s fertilizer products 
credit sales by jinong have also increased during the fiscal year ended june  contributing to the decrease in cash provided by operations 
in addition to an increase in accounts receivables  our inventory has increased to keep up with the increase in our revenues which also results in a decrease in cash provided by operations 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june  was  a decrease of  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  the  used in investing activities in was on purchases of property plant and equipment 
in the  used in investing activities consisted of purchases of property  plant and equipment of  the acquisition of gufeng of  and an increase in construction in progress of  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities in the fiscal year ended june  totaled  the net cash provided by financing activities for the same period in and was and  mainly due to the public offerings 
the cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the proceeds of loans of at june   and  our loans payable were as follows june  june  june  short term loans payable   total   excludes gufeng  which was acquired in july accounts receivable we had accounts receivable of  as of june   as compared to  and  as of june  and  respectively  an increase of  and  or and  respectively 
to retain and expand its market share  gufeng enhanced its warehouse selling and increased the credit sales for gufeng s fertilizer products 
jinong has increased its sales of humic acid fertilizer products including liquid and powder fertilizers as a result of increased distributors and the aggressive marketing 
the significant increase in account receivable is directly attributed to the significant increase in credit sales over the most recent fiscal year 
management continually monitors and evaluates the structure and collectability of its accounts receivable balances  performs routine assessment of our customers creditworthiness and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts when necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  as of june   as compared to  and  as of june  and  respectively  an increase of  and  or and  respectively 
the increase of allowance for doubtful accounts was mainly due to the increased credit sales in gufeng 
inventories we had an inventory of  as of june   as compared to  and  as of june  and  an increase of  and  or and 
the main reason for this increase was that we increased our packing material reserves and our finished fertilizer products for sale to meet the anticipated large order 
sales for the fiscal year ended june  have increased by approximately and over the comparable periods in and  respectively 
we have had to increase our inventory to keep up with current demand for our products 
advances to suppliers we had advances to suppliers of  as of june  as compared to  and  as of june  and  respectively  representing an increase of  and  or and  respectively 
the increase in the amount of advances to suppliers is mainly due to gufeng s seasonal compound fertilizer business  which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital 
to ensure our ability to deliver compound fertilizer to the distributor timely prior to the planting season  we need to have sufficient raw material in stock to feed the production 
to build up the inventory  we typically make advance payment to the supplier to secure the supply of raw material of basic fertilizer 
our inability to predict future seasonal fertilizer demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 
accounts payable we had accounts payable of  as of june  as compared to  and  as of june  and  representing an increase of  and  or and  
the increase was mainly attributable to late payment on packing material due to late receipt of invoices 
unearned revenue we had unearned revenue of  as of june  as compared to  and  as of june  and  respectively  representing a decrease of  or and an increase of  or  respectively 
the decrease in unearned revenue results from the expanded credit sales to selected distributors in gufeng s warehouse sales program 
such program is a customized marketing strategy that requires less or few advanced deposit payment from the participating distributors prior to the delivery of fertilizer products 
with offering participating distributors certain sales credits in distributing the fertilizer products through the program  the company manages more account receivables and concurrently has less unearned revenue 
tax payable we had taxes payable of  as of june  as compared to  and  as of june  and  respectively  representing an increase of  and  or and  respectively 
this increase was mainly due to the growth and expansion from gufeng post to its acquisition  which had taxes payable of  as of june  contractual obligations at june   our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than one to three to more than one year three years five years five years total short term loans  operating lease obligations    total     off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
our financial statements reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and judgments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following paragraphs reflect the more critical accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition sales revenue is recognized at the date of shipment to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the delivery is completed  we have no other significant obligations and collectability is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue 
our revenue consists of invoiced value of goods  net of a value added tax vat 
no product return or sales discount allowance is made as products delivered and accepted by customers are not returnable and sales discounts are not granted after products are delivered 
accounts receivable our policy is to maintain reserves for potential credit losses on accounts receivable 
management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves 
any accounts receivable that is outstanding for more than three months will be accounted as allowance for bad debts 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost determined on a weighted average basis or market 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process  finished goods and packaging materials 
the company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods and establishes reserves when determined necessary 
estimate impairment of long lived assets the company tests long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
estimate impairment of intangible assets the company records intangible assets acquired individually or as part of a group at fair value 
intangible assets with definitive lives are amortized over the useful life of the intangible asset  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the entity s future cash flows 
the company evaluates intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more often whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
whenever any such impairment exists  an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the company has not recorded impairment of intangible assets as of june    and  respectively 
fair value measurement and disclosures our accounting for fair value measurement and disclosures  defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
this topic also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires classification based on observable and unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions unobservable inputs 
the hierarchy consists of three levels level one quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level two inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level three unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions  which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use 
determining which category an asset or liability falls within the hierarchy requires significant judgment 
the company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter 
the company had no assets and liabilities measured at fair value at june  the carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  trade and other receivables  trade and other payables approximate their fair values due to the short maturities of these instruments 
stock based compensation the costs of all employee stock options  as well as other equity based compensation arrangements  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date 
that cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
stock compensation for stock granted to non employees is determined as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years 
under the asset and liability approach  deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the company is able to realize their benefits  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position 
the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not criteria should be de recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met 
penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred 
no significant penalties or interest relating to income taxes have been incurred during the years ended june   and gaap also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition

recent accounting pronouncements for information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of business 
market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur as a result of movements in interest rates and equity prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments in the normal course of business that are subject to changes in financial market conditions 
currency fluctuations and foreign currency risk substantially all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in rmb 
however  we use the us dollar for financial reporting purposes 
conversion of rmb into foreign currencies is regulated by the people s bank of china through a unified floating exchange rate system 
although the prc government has stated its intention to support the value of rmb  there can be no assurance that such exchange rate will not again become volatile or that rmb will not devalue significantly against the us dollar 
exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value  in us dollar terms  of our net assets and income derived from our operations in the prc 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
except for the us holding companies  all of our consolidated revenues  consolidated costs and expenses  and our assets are denominated in rmb 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollars and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates and shareholders equity is translated at historical exchange rates 
any resulting translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are included in determining other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
as of june   our accumulated other comprehensive income was million 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the value of the renminbi against the us dollar and other currencies is affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
since july  the renminbi has not been pegged to the us dollar 
although the people s bank of china regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to prevent significant short term fluctuations in the exchange rate  the renminbi may appreciate or depreciate significantly in value against the us dollar in the medium to long term 
moreover  it is possible that in the future  prc authorities may lift restrictions on fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate and lessen intervention in the foreign exchange market 
interest rate risk we deposit surplus funds with chinese banks earning daily interest 
we do not invest in any instruments for trading purposes 
all of our outstanding debt instruments carry fixed rates of interests 
the amount of short term debt outstanding as of june  and june  was million and million  respectively 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily with respect to our short term bank loans 
although the interest rates  which are based on the banks prime rates with respect to our short term loans are fixed for the terms of the loans  the terms are typically three to twelve months for short term bank loans and interest rates are subject to change upon renewal 
there were no material changes in interest rates for short term bank loans renewed during the three months ended june  the original loan term on average is one year  and the remaining average life of the short term loans is nine months 
management monitors the banks prime rates in conjunction with our cash requirements to determine the appropriate level of debt balances relative to other sources of funds 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk 
credit risk we have not experienced significant credit risk  as most of our customers are long term customers with superior payment records 
our receivables are monitored regularly by our credit managers 
inflation risk inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
