overview of the company s business we are a niche and high value added steel processing company principally engaged in the manufacture and sale of high precision cold rolled steel products  in the provision of heat treatment and in the cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips 
we use commodity steel to create a specialty premium steel 
specialty precision steel pertains to the precision of measurements and tolerances of thickness  shape  width  surface finish and other special quality features of highly engineered end use applications 
we produce and sell precision ultra thin and high strength cold rolled steel products ranging from mm to mm 
we also provide heat treatment and cutting and slitting of medium and high carbon hot rolled steel strips not exceeding mm thickness 
our process puts hot rolled de scaled pickled steel coils through a cold rolling mill  utilizing our patented systems and high technology reduction processing procedures  to make steel coils and sheets in customized thicknesses according to customer specifications 
currently  our precision products are mainly used in the manufacture of automobile parts and components  steel roofing  plane friction discs  appliances  food packaging materials  saw blades  textile needles  and microelectronics 
to fully utilize the additional capacity from our nd and rd mills  and to meet the robust demand from the home appliances segment and roofing materials used in domestic construction in the past two years  we have diverted away from our niche focus of producing only high value added products 
we conduct our operations principally in china through our wholly owned operating subsidiaries  chengtong and shanghai blessford  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of our direct subsidiary  pshl 
most of our sales are made domestically in china  however  we began exporting during fiscal and our overseas market currently covers indonesia  thailand  the caribbean  nigeria and ethiopia 
we intend to further expand into additional overseas markets in the future  subject to suitable market conditions and favorable regulatory controls 
to remodel our business to make it sustainable  we are putting in place a series of measures to cut cost and increase overall profitability 
these measures include initiating additional sales and marketing efforts to expand customer base and increase total demand  strategizing our product mix to re focus on our niche capabilities including the ultra thin low carbon and high strength high carbon products  streamlining production and reducing the number of workers  hiring professionals and technicians to improve production management and increase quality control  continue to carry out r d to improve profitability of existing products and launch new high value add products  and improve working capital efficiency by increasing turnovers of advances to suppliers and accounts receivables 
we will also continue to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of customers and suppliers with the downward pressure in the prc economy which has caused many difficulties faced by businesses 
recent developments on september   we received notice from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market  llc indicating that  for the last consecutive business days  the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum per share required for continued inclusion on the nasdaq capital market nasdaq under nasdaq listing rule a 
the notification letter stated that we would be provided calendar days  or until march   to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
in order to regain compliance  shares of our common stock must maintain a minimum bid closing price of at least per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days 
on march   the company received a second letter from nasdaq notifying the company that it had not regained compliance during the initial day grace period  but that nasdaq was granting the company an additional day grace period  or until september   to regain compliance 
on august   we completed a reverse stock split of our common stock at a ratio of share of common stock for every shares  to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the nasdaq minimum bid price requirements 
since the reverse stock split  the bid price for our common stock has been above per share 
on august  and on october   respectively  each of che kin lui and daniel carlson resigned from their respective positions as members of the company s board of directors for personal reasons and not because of any disagreement with the company on any matter relating to the company s operations  policies or practices 
while mr 
carlson served as a non executive and non voting director  mr 
lui served as an independent member of the board and also served on the company s audit committee  compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committee 
the company s board of directors is in the process of vetting suitable candidates to fill the vacancies created by mr 
lui s departure and will announce any such appointment as soon as it is complete 
fiscal financial performance highlights during the year ended june   we saw a reduction in demand for our cold rolled steel products together with rising costs 
inflation and especially high raw material costs have substantially and adversely impacted our gross margin compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  tightened credit and slowing growth in china have caused our accounts receivable to rise sharply for the year ended june   a trend that is strongly correlated to those of the companies in the coal and steel sectors in china during the past year 
during the year ended june   we sold a total of  tons of products  a decrease of  tons from  tons a year ago  due to a decrease in demand in the domestic market 
such decrease was mainly driven by decreases in demand from the food packaging and automobile components markets in connection with the slowing growth of the chinese economy during the year ended june  despite a downward trend in steel prices during the year  our average cost per unit sold increased while average selling prices decreased along with steel prices year on year  mainly due to our lock in of raw material prices at higher levels in our advance purchase contracts 
decreased volume and sales coupled with rising costs led to a gross loss of  and a net loss of  for the year ended june  total company backlog as of june  amounted to  the company has also been renegotiating with its major suppliers to get a partial refund of our advances to suppliers in an effort to mitigate the lock in raw material cost 
in june and july  we defaulted on the repayment obligations of our short term and long term bank loans totaling  we are currently in discussions with our banks regarding the restructuring of these loans for repayment but have not yet agreed on specific terms 
any restructuring will be subject to approval by the banks governing bodies  and to our ability to meet certain conditions and requirements that may be imposed by the banks 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loans 
we are implementing a series of measures  discussed above  to remodel our business to make it sustainable  and as part of the ongoing discussions with banks to potentially restructure our bank loans 
we believe that high barriers to entry in the chinese domestic precision cold rolled steel industry still exist because of the level of technological expertise and the amount of capital required for operation 
although we expect slowing demand and volatilities in both domestic and international markets  and a difficult operating environment due to high inflation and rising costs which could have adverse impacts on our gross margins in the near future  the medium to long term prospects of our niche remain optimistic 
we believe that our unique capabilities and know how give us a competitive advantage to grow sales and build a globally recognized brand as we continue to carry out r d and expand to new segments  customers and markets 
the following are some financial highlights for the year revenues our revenues were approximately million for the year  a decrease of from last year 
gross margin gross margin was for the year  compared to last year 
loss from operations before tax loss from operations before tax was approximately million for the year  compared to approximately million of income last year

sales by product line a break down of our sales by product line for the years ended june  and is as follows year on product category quantity tons amount of sales quantity tons amount of sales year qty 
variance low carbon hard rolled    low carbon cold rolled   high carbon hot rolled    high carbon cold rolled   subcontracting income    sales of scrap   total    there were different trends of demand across various product categories during the year ended june  low carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june  the increase in demand in this category was a result of increased orders of steel used in the production of home appliances and steel roofing materials as a result of growth in domestic consumer spending in these segments during the year 
low carbon hard rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the sales mix at an average selling price per ton of for the year ended june   due to an increase in demand in the export market year on year as a result of our more competitive prices in the global market 
high carbon cold rolled steel products accounted for of the current sales mix at an average selling price of  per ton for the year ended june   compared to of the current sales mix at an average selling price of for the year ended june  the products in this category are mainly used in the automobile industry and the decrease in sales volume year on year was a result of the slowing growth of automobile sales in the prc market 
subcontracting income revenues accounted for  or  of the sales mix for the year ended june   a decrease from  or  of the sales mix for the year ended june  the products in this category are mostly high carbon products and mainly used in electrical engineering and industrial grade tooling materials  for which we received limited orders during the year ended june  variance average selling prices low carbon hard rolled low carbon cold rolled high carbon hot rolled   high carbon cold rolled  subcontracting income the average selling price per ton decreased to for the year ended june   compared to in  representing a decrease of  or  year on year 
this decrease was mainly due to decreases in general steel prices and therefore our selling prices during the year 
during the year ended june   there were decreases in average selling prices across all product categories except for high carbon products

and zhejiang yongfeng steel co  ltd  new major customers for the year ended june   accounted for of our sales revenues 
the change in customer mix reflects management s continuous efforts in expanding our customer base and geographical coverage during the course of the year 
cost of goods sold cost of sales increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  cost of sales represented of sales revenues for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june  average cost per unit sold increased to for the year ended june   compared to for the year ended june   representing an increase of per ton  or  year on year 
variance cost of goods sold raw materials    direct labor    manufacturing overhead    cost per unit sold total units sold tons    average cost per unit sold ton the increase in average per unit cost of sales is represented by the combined effect of an increase in cost of raw materials per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june   an increase in factory overhead per unit sold of  or  from for the year ended june   to for the year ended june despite a downward trend in steel prices during the year  the cost of raw materials consumed increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  this increase was primarily due to our obligations under advance purchase contracts pursuant to which we have locked in the price of raw materials at the higher prices then prevailing 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in total units sold 
direct labor costs increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  manufacturing overhead costs increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the increase was mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase in depreciation charged to manufacturing overhead of  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  and partially offset by a decrease in utilities of  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  the decreased units sold  year on year  have led to an increase in average manufacturing overhead cost per unit sold of due to decreased economies of scale 
gross profit gross profit in absolute terms decreased by  or  year on year  to a loss of  for the year ended june   from profit of  for the year ended june   and gross profit margin decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  the decrease in gross profit margin is mainly attributable to the combined effect of an increase in average cost per unit sold of due to the lock in of raw material prices under our advance purchase contracts and a decrease in average selling prices  year on year  due to falling steel prices during the year ended june  selling expenses selling expenses decreased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   from  in the decrease was mainly attributable to less selling expenses associated with lower sales revenues year on year 
administrative expenses administrative expenses increased by  or  year on year  to  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  this was chiefly due to an inventories write down in the amount of  during the year ended june  allowance for bad and doubtful debts allowance for bad and doubtful debts increased by  year on year 
allowance recognized for the year ended june  was in the amount of  in accordance with our policy for allowance for bad and doubtful debts set forth under the critical accounting policies and estimates heading in this report 
income from operations income from operations decreased by  or  year on year  to a loss of  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june   as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income other income increased  or  to  for the year ended june  from  for the year ended june  as a percentage of revenues  other income increased to for the year ended june  from less than for the year ended june  the increase in other income was primarily due to gain on disposal of a motor vehicle during the year ended june  interest expense total interest expense increased  or  to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  due to increases in interest rates year on year and the accrual of penalty interest resulting from our loan default during the year ended june  income tax for the year ended june   we recognized an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  for the year ended june  the decrease of  or  was due to a net loss in the year ended june  and tax refund received as a result of the net loss  as compared to net income in net income net income decreased by  or  year on year  to net loss of  for the year ended june   compared to net income of  for the year ended june  the decrease in net income is attributable to a combination of all the factors discussed above  the major factors being an increase in the average cost per unit sold and a decrease in gross margin 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for  among other things  the purchase and maintenance of equipment used in our operations 
our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from capital expenditures  working capital requirements and principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness 
we have historically met these liquidity requirements with cash provided by operations  equity financing  and bank debt 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the following table provides detailed information about our net cash flows for all financial statement periods presented in this report cash flows year ended june  net cash provided by used in operating activities  net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in financing activities   net cash flows   net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended june  were  as compared to net cash flows used in operating activities of  for the year ended june   for a net increase of  this increase was mainly due to an increase in cash inflows from advances to suppliers of  due to management s efforts in lowering such balance  an increase in cash inflows for inventories of  and an increase in cash inflows from accounts payable and accrued expenses of  offset by a decrease in cash inflows from accounts receivable of  during the year ended june  for the year ended june   sales revenues generated from the top five major customers as a percentage of total sales were  compared with for the prior year 
the loss of all or portion of the sales volume from a significant customer would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
in addition  tightened credit and slowing growth in china have caused our accounts receivable to rise sharply during the year ended june   a trend that strongly correlates to those of the companies in the coal and steel sectors in china in the past year 
we note that the continuation or intensification of the worldwide economic crisis and downturn of the chinese economy may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations to us  resulting in unrecoverable losses on our accounts receivable 
we will continue to strengthen our collection activities and closely monitor any changes in collection experience and the credit ratings of our customers 
from time to time we will review credit periods offered  along with our collection experience and the other relevant factors  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
delays or non payment of accounts receivable would have an adverse effect on our operating cash flows 
investing activities our main uses of cash for investing activities during the year ended june  were for the purchase of property  plant and equipment related to the addition of annealing furnaces at our shanghai blessford facilities 
we believe this capital investment increases our capacity  expands product lines  improves product qualities and creates synergies with our existing production facilities  thereby creating opportunities to grow sales  enter new markets and further strengthen our leading position in the niche cold rolling segment that we operate in 
net cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended june  was  as compared with  for the year ended june  cash flows used in investing activities substantially decreased as we did not have any material construction commitments during the year 
we forecast lower capital expenditures in the coming years as the company has already completed most of its major expansion plans and all the construction costs relating to our third cold rolling mill have been paid for as at june  financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended june  were  as compared to  for the year ended june   for a net increase of  during the year ended june   the company made repayment of loans in the amount of  and received no additional loan proceeds 
on december   we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec  which was declared effective on december  the shelf registration will permit us to issue securities valued at up to an aggregate of million and provides us the flexibility to issue registered securities  from time to time  in one or more separate offerings or other transactions with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
although we do not have any commitments or current intentions to sell securities under the registration statement  we believe that it is prudent to have a shelf registration statement in place to ensure financing flexibility should the need arise 
our working capital requirements and the cash flow provided by future operating activities will vary from quarter to quarter  and are dependent on factors such as volume of business and payment terms with our customers 
as such  we may need to rely on access to the financial markets to provide us with significant discretionary funding capacity 
however  the current uncertainty arising out of domestic and global economic conditions  including the continuing disruption in credit markets  poses a risk to the economies in which we operate and may adversely impact our potential sources of capital financing 
the general unavailability of credit could make capital financing more expensive for us or impossible altogether 
even if we are able to obtain credit  the incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations 
in june and july  we defaulted on the repayment obligations of our short term and long term bank loans totaling  we are currently in discussions with our banks regarding the restructuring of these loans for repayment but have not yet agreed on specific terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loans 
further  each of these lenders has the right to take possession of the collateral which collectively constitute substantial assets of the company granted in connection with their respective loan agreements 
the unavailability of debt financing as a result of economic pressures on the credit and equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
going concern historically  we have funded our operations and expansion expenditures from cash generated by operating activities  bank borrowings and issuance of common stock 
we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet business requirements for the next twelve months if we are able to work out a repayment plan acceptable to us with our banks for the defaulted loans 
the uncertainty surrounding the successful restructuring of our bank loans and our current lack of readily available liquidity provided by other third party sources raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern 
current assets current assets decreased by  or  year on year  to  as of june   from  as of june   principally as a result of a decrease in advances to suppliers of  or  year on year  a decrease in cash of  or  year on year  and a decrease in inventories of  or  year on year  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of  or  year on year 
accounts receivable  representing of total current assets as of june   is a significant asset of the company 
we offer credit to our customers in the normal course of our business and accounts receivable is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
credit periods vary substantially across industries  segments  types and size of companies in china where we operate our business 
because of the niche products that we process  our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment  who then sell their products to the end product manufacturers 
the business cycle is relatively long  as well as the credit periods 
the company offers credit to its customers for periods of days  days  days and days 
we generally offer longer credit terms to long standing recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations 
our management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining at least quarterly communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the company 
in making this determination  our management also considers past collection experience  our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market 
we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis and downturn of the chinese economy may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations 
to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  for the year ended june   our management has made a provision for all accounts receivable that are over days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over one year past due 
from time to time  we will review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
the following table reflects the aging of our accounts receivable based on due date as of june  and june  us total current to days to days to days to days over year total     june  us total current to days to days to days to days over year total     management continues to take appropriate actions to perform business and credit reviews of any prospective customers whether new or returning to protect the company from any who might pose a high credit risk to our business based on their commercial credit reports  our past collection history with them  and our perception of the risk posed by their geographic location 
for example  we have halted since the year ended june  all our sales transactions directly with customers in the philippines as we consider the associated credit risk to be relatively high 
based on publicly available reports  such as that issued by am best  there is a high risk that financial volatility may erupt in that country due to inadequate reporting standards  a weak banking system or asset markets and or poor regulatory structure 
we expect to resume such exports when conditions improve 
current liabilities increased by  or  year on year  to  as of june   from  as of june  the increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the current portion of the long term loan of  or  year on year 
we have classified all of the remaining balance of our long term loan as current liabilities as we have defaulted on the principal and interest repayment obligations of such loan in june the company is currently in discussions with its bank regarding the restructuring of the loans for repayment but has not yet agreed on specific terms 
until such agreement is reached  the bank has the right to cancel the total outstanding commitment of the loan  demand immediate repayment of the loan or any part thereof together with accrued interest  and or terminate the loan agreement 
as of june   we also had  in short term loans 
principal and interest under the loans were to be repaid in full on july   but the company has defaulted on this repayment obligation 
the company is currently in discussions with its bank regarding the restructuring of the loans but there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully work out a repayment plan or otherwise fulfill its obligations under the loan

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following functional currency and translating financial statements the company s principal country of operations is the prc 
our functional currency is chinese renminbi  however  the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been expressed in usd 
the consolidated balance sheets have been translated into usd at the exchange rates prevailing at each balance sheet date 
the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows have been translated using the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during the periods of each statement 
the registered equity capital denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution 
all translation adjustments resulting from the translation of the financial statements into the reporting currency are dealt with as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of goods and services is recognized on the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership  which generally coincides with the time when the goods are delivered to customers and the title has passed and services have been rendered 
revenue is reported net of all vat taxes 
other income is recognized when it is earned 
accounts receivable credit periods vary substantially across industries  segments  types and size of companies in china where we operate our business 
because of the niche products that we process  our customers are usually also niche players in their own respective segment  who then sell their products to end product manufacturers 
the business cycle is relatively long  as well as credit periods 
the company offers credit to its customers for periods of days  days  days and days 
we generally offer longer credit terms to long standing recurring customers with good payment histories and sizable operations 
accounts receivable is recorded at the time revenue is recognized and is stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the collectability of the accounts receivable 
management determines the collectability of outstanding accounts by maintaining regular communication with such customers and obtaining confirmation of their intent to fulfill their obligations to the company 
management also considers past collection experience  our relationship with customers and the impact of current economic conditions on our industry and market 
however  we note that the continuation or intensification of the current global economic crisis may have negative consequences on the business operations of our customers and adversely impact their ability to meet their financial obligations 
to reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable  management has made a provision for all accounts receivable that are over days past due and full provision for all accounts receivable over year past due 
from time to time  we will review these credit periods  along with our collection experience and the other factors discussed above  to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  and to make changes to the allowance  if necessary 
if our actual collection experience or other conditions change  revisions to our allowances may be required  including a further provision which could adversely affect our operating income  or write back of provision when estimated uncollectible accounts are actually collected 
at june  and  the company had  and  of allowances for doubtful accounts  respectively 
bad debts are written off for past due balances over two years or when it becomes known to management that such amount is uncollectible 
there was a provision for accounts receivable bad debts of  and  recognized for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the current year charge reflects a provision for doubtful accounts based on our policy described above 
our management is continually working to ensure that any known uncollectible amounts are immediately written off as bad debt against outstanding balances 
advances to suppliers in order to ensure a steady supply of raw materials  the company is required from time to time to make cash advances to its suppliers when placing purchase orders  for a guaranteed minimum delivery quantity at future times when raw materials are required 
the advance is seen as a deposit to suppliers and guarantees our access to raw materials during periods of shortages and market volatility  and is therefore considered an important component of our operations 
contracted raw materials are priced at prevailing market rates when the advance purchase contracts are entered into 
advances to suppliers are shown net of an allowance which represents potentially unrecoverable cash advances at each balance sheet date 
such allowances are based on an analysis of past raw materials receipt experience and the credibility of each supplier according to its size and background 
in general  we do not provide allowances against advances paid to those prc state owned companies as there is minimal risk of default 
our allowances for advances to suppliers are subjective critical estimates that have a direct impact on reported net earnings  and are reviewed quarterly at a minimum to reflect changes from our historic raw materials receipt experience and to ensure the appropriateness of the allowance in light of the circumstances present at the time of the review 
it is reasonably possible that the company s estimate of the allowance will change  such as in the case when the company becomes aware of a supplier s inability to deliver the contracted raw materials or meet its financial obligations 
as of june  and  the company made allowances of advances to suppliers of  and  respectively 
there was a provision for advances to suppliers bad debts of  and nil recognized for the years ended june  and  respectively 
allowances for advances to suppliers are written off when all efforts to collect the materials or recover the cash advances have been unsuccessful  or when it has become known to the management that there is no intention for the suppliers to deliver the contracted raw materials or refund the cash advances 
to date  we have not written off any advances to suppliers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
intangible assets intangible assets represent land use rights in china acquired by the company and are stated at cost less amortization and impairment  if any 
amortization of land use rights is calculated on the straight line method  based on the period over which the right is granted by the relevant authorities in china 
the company acquired land use rights in august and december for years that expire in august and december  respectively 
the land use rights are amortized over a fifty year term 
amortizable intangible assets of the company are reviewed when there are triggering events to determine whether their carrying value has become impaired  in conformity with asc the company also re evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
as of june   as the company s market capitalization was lower than the carrying value of its assets  management performed an impairment test in accordance with asc as the fair market value substantially exceeds the carrying value of our land use rights due to appreciation in the value of land use rights in china in the past decade  no impairment charges were recognized for the relevant year 
as of june   the company expects these assets to be fully recoverable based on the result of the impairment test 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the cost of an asset comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its present working condition and location for its intended use 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes 
the estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment are as follows buildings years plant and machinery years motor vehicles years office equipment years repairs and maintenance costs are normally charged to the statement of operations in the year in which they are incurred 
in situations where it can be clearly demonstrated that the expenditure has resulted in an increase in the future economic benefits expected to be obtained from the use of the asset  the expenditure is capitalized as an additional cost of the asset 
the company accounts for impairment of property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with asc  which requires the company to evaluate a long lived asset for recoverability when there is an event or circumstance that indicates the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we determine such impairment by measuring the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by these assets  comparing the result to the assets carrying values and  if necessary  adjusting the assets to the lower of its carrying value or fair value and charging current operations for the measured impairment 
the determination of the undiscounted future cash flows and fair value of these assets are subject to significant judgment 
as of june   the company s market capitalization was significantly lower than its total stockholders equity 
management considered this to be an indicator of impairment  and accordingly  performed an impairment test  using a normal and a worse case scenario  and assessed fair value based on average tons sold  selling price per ton  gross margin  and other cash inflows and outflows for the next ten years where our mills are expected to remain in operation 
we estimated volume sold and the sales revenues based upon prices at which management reasonably estimates them to be sold in the next ten years 
in performing the impairment test  management also made assumptions that the company would be able to restructure its defaulted bank loans with favorable and less favorable terms  respectively 
no impairment charges were recognized for the current year 
assumptions and estimates used in our impairment test provide the general direction of major factors expected to affect our business and cash flows  and are subject to risks and uncertainties such as changes in interest rates  industry cyclicality  and factors surrounding the general chinese and global economies 
those estimates will be reassessed for their reasonableness at each impairment test 
other policies other accounting policies used by the company are set forth in the notes accompanying our financial statements 
seasonality our operating results and operating cash flows historically have been subject to seasonal variations 
our revenues are usually higher in the second half of the calendar year than in the first half of the calendar year and the first quarter of the calendar year is usually the slowest quarter because fewer projects are undertaken during and around the chinese new year holidays 
off balance sheet arrangements for the year ended june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements
