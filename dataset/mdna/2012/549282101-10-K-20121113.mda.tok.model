item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august  fiscal year  august  fiscal year and august  fiscal year  included in item of this report 
overview in fiscal year  we generated revenues primarily by providing quality food to customers at our luby s cafeteria branded restaurants located primarily in texas and fuddruckers restaurants located throughout the united states  koo koo roo restaurants in california  and fuddruckers franchises located primarily in the united states 
on july   we became a multi brand restaurant company with a national footprint through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers 
the fuddruckers acquisition added company operated restaurants and a franchise network of franchisee operated units 
this acquisition further expanded our family friendly  value oriented portfolio of restaurants located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
in addition to our restaurant business model  we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities  colleges and universities  as well as businesses and institutions 
in fiscal years and  we continued to operate our two core brands in the competitive fast casual segment of the restaurant industry 
much of our strategic focus centered around refining our prototype restaurant designs  exploring new avenues for revenue growth  re investing in our core restaurant models via remodel activity  and supporting our growth initiatives with various marketing techniques 
since the acquisition of fuddruckers  we have opened franchise units  four new prototype company units and acquired units from franchisees 
we were able to grow sales at our company operated fuddruckers restaurants through a combination of local market outreach  upgrading the d cor of some of our restaurants  and training our restaurant management and crews for the highest level of customer service 
some specific local market outreach programs included partnering with local youth sporting teams  customer surveying  and further establishing relationships with other local businesses so that there is high awareness of the fuddruckers offerings among their employees and customers 
at our luby s cafeteria brand  we were very encouraged by the full year results of our newest cafeteria that opened at the end of fiscal year this was a location where we relocated from an in line shopping center to a newly constructed luby s prototype on a pad side in the parking lot 
the sales at this unit give us further confidence that the luby s cafeteria brand has broad appeal and generates solid cash flow returns with this prototype at the right location 
through focused efforts  the cafeteria brand also found solid success with growing the catering business  which includes large take out orders as well as delivery to a customer s location 
we continue menu development and innovation at both brands and rotate seasonal offerings throughout the year to generate interest and excitement at our restaurants 
our all you can eat breakfast buffet that we rolled out at a majority of our cafeteria locations in fiscal year continued to contribute to our sales volume in fiscal year we also reduced the breadth and frequency of limited time offers in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in efforts to improve gross profit margins while offering everyday value menu pricing to our guests 
store level profit margin improved to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the food commodity price inflation that we experienced in the first two quarters of fiscal year subsided in the third and fourth quarter and the food cost management practices that we implemented were effective at reducing waste and identifying areas for food cost savings 
training of our restaurant management and crew members in restaurant unit economics  with a focus on matching the cost structure to the sales and traffic volume at each restaurant  contributed to year over year improvement in store level profit margins 
average customer spend increased at both of our core restaurant brands as we reduced our limited time offers removing the inherent discounts from these specially priced items  improved the mix of menu items sold  and encouraged the purchase 
table of contents of additional add on menu items through suggestive selling initiatives 
customer counts increased at fuddruckers and decreased at our cafeteria units 
the decrease in customer counts at our cafeteria units was primarily a reduction in the quantity of kids meals sold and a reduction in the quantity of limited time offers 
our goal in fiscal year will continue to be balance the trade off between customer growth and average customer spend 
our aim is always to increase customer frequency by marketing quality offerings and building long term brand loyalty and increased profitability 
capital spending increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this capital investment included the development of one cafeteria and three fuddruckers two restaurants opened on the first day of fiscal year  funding our remodeling program  recurring maintenance capital including infrastructure projects  as well as property that we acquired and leased to a franchisee 
we remain committed to maintaining the attractiveness of all of our restaurant locations where we anticipate operating over the long term 
in fiscal year  we anticipate making capital investments of between million and million  primarily for maintaining and remodeling of existing units  purchase of property  and construction of new restaurant units 
we have been able to use our cash from operations to fund our capital expenditures 
additional cash has been generated with the sale of properties that were closed as part of or before the implementation of our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan announced in october as a result  we have been able to use the proceeds from these property sales and excess cash generated from operations to significantly pay down our debt balance to million by the end of fiscal year  representing an approximate reduction in our outstanding debt balance over a two year period 
fiscal year review same store restaurant sales at our restaurant units increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the fuddruckers restaurants were not included in our same store grouping until the third quarter of fiscal year had the fuddruckers restaurants been included in the same store grouping for all of fiscal year  our same store sales increase would have been 
same store sales increased for each of the four quarters in fiscal year  the first time this has been achieved since fiscal year our increase in same store sales was generated by an increase in average customer spend at both of our core restaurant brands and an increase in customer traffic at our fuddruckers restaurants 
income from continuing operations improved from million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year to income from continuing operations of million  or per share  on million in total sales in fiscal year fiscal year income from continuing operations improved by million year over year 
this profitability improvement was the result of expanding store level profit defined as restaurant sales less food costs  payroll and related cost  and other operating expenses and lower interest expense 
store level profit as a percentage of restaurant sales improved basis points in fiscal year compared to fiscal year food costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the decrease in food costs as a percentage of restaurant sales is due to more effective cost management practices resulting  in part  from the restaurant back office system we implemented in fiscal year  as well as the benefit of investing in enhanced training for our restaurant managers and crews 
payroll and related costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  improved to in fiscal year from in fiscal year payroll and related costs as a percentage of sales improved as crew labor costs decreased as result of better labor scheduling processes adopted during the year  including the ability to react more quickly to changes in customer traffic 

table of contents operating expenses  as percentage of restaurant sales  decreased to in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year the improvement was due to significant reductions in utilities and other reductions in restaurant supplies  services and repairs and maintenance expense  partially offset by increases in marketing and advertising expenses and insurance costs 
depreciation expense increased million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to investments made in new locations as well as the capital we have used for remodeling existing locations and reflects primarily the addition of fuddruckers assets  partially offset by lower depreciation of our cafeteria assets 
general and administrative expenses increased by million reflecting primarily an increase in salaries and benefits 
interest expense decreased million on lower average outstanding debt balances 
the lower debt balances are a result of cash from operations and proceeds from property sales being used to first fund capital investments and then reduce debt balances 
income taxes included a valuation allowance release of million in fiscal year income from continuing operations offset by an unrecognized tax benefit accrual of million 
our culinary contract services ccs business continued to grow as this business generated million in sales during fiscal year compared to million in sales during fiscal year we view this area as a growth business that generally requires less capital investment and more favorable percentage returns on invested capital 
our long term plan continues to focus on expanding both of our brands  including the fuddruckers franchise network  as well as growing our ccs business 
we are also committed to making capital investments with suitable return characteristics  reducing debt through sales of properties where we have closed restaurants as well as using cash flow from operations 
we believe our operational execution has improved through our commitment to higher operating standards  and we believe that we are well positioned to enhance shareholder value over the long term 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
accordingly  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
however  every fifth or sixth year  we have a fiscal year that consists of weeks  accounting for days in the aggregate  fiscal year was such a year 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
however  the fourth quarter of fiscal year  as a result of the additional week  consisted of three four week periods and one five week period  accounting for weeks  or days  in the aggregate 
fiscal years and both contained weeks 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
the fuddruckers units that were acquired in july were included in the same store grouping beginning with the third quarter of fiscal yaer stores that close on a permanent basis are removed from the group in the fiscal quarter when operations cease at the restaurant  but remain in the same store group for previously reported fiscal quarters 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales at our restaurant units increased for fiscal year  increased for fiscal year and decreased for fiscal year 
table of contents the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters increase decrease fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales discontinued operations our cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan called for the closure of underperforming units

these decreases in payroll and labor costs were offset by some increases in restaurant management positions at certain units to support the local store marketing initiatives  drive incremental sales  while further improving customer service 
other operating expenses other operating expenses primarily include restaurant related expenses for utilities  repairs and maintenance  advertising  insurance  services and occupancy costs 
other operating expenses improved approximately million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decrease was due primarily to decreases in most cost categories and the inclusion of one additional week in fiscal year the additional week accounted for approximately million in other operating expenses

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents remained flat as of fiscal year end compared to fiscal year end cash provided by operating activities of million was offset by cash used in financing activities of million and cash used in investing activities of million 
cash flow from operations was favorably impacted by increased total revenue in fiscal year compared to fiscal year and by significant improvements in cost of food  payroll and related costs and other operating costs 
although we decreased our repayments of our credit facility in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  we increased our capital expenditures and we plan to continue the level of capital expenditures necessary to keep our restaurants attractive and operating efficiently 
although macroeconomic conditions continued to affect our cash flow from operations in fiscal year  cash and cash equivalents were favorably impacted by the acquired fuddruckers assets as well as increased revenue and related cash flow from luby s cafeterias units during fiscal year and by proceeds from disposal of assets and property held for sale 
our capital expenditures and cash used to repay debt were significantly higher in fiscal year than fiscal year cash and cash equivalents were primarily affected by the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers and the related financing during the fourth quarter of fiscal year ended august  and the related borrowing under our credit facility and the macroeconomic conditions that affected our fiscal year cash flow from operations 
our cash requirements consisted principally of payments to reduce our debt  capital expenditures for culinary contract services development and construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades and information technology  and working capital primarily for our company owned restaurants and culinary contract services agreements 
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of fuddruckers in fiscal year required us to amend and utilize our revolving credit facility 
cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets allowed for debt repayments 
under the current terms of our revolving credit facility  as amended through october   capital expenditures and the amount of borrowings are limited based on our ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  as amended  governing the revolving credit facility 
based upon our level of past and projected capital requirements  we expect that proceeds from the sale of assets and cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
however  higher levels of accounts receivable are typical for culinary contract services and franchises 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets

claims certain current and former hourly restaurant employees filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the southern district of texas alleging violations of the fair labor standards act with respect to the inclusion of certain employees in a tip pool 
the lawsuit sought back wages  penalties and attorney s fees and was conditionally certified as a collective action in october on october   we agreed to a court settlement amount of million  recognized in general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter fiscal year we made related payments of million as of august   as required by the settlement

pappas  who is a director of luby s  inc critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset  management will evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits of such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax asset will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law 

table of contents at the end of fiscal year  the company had total deferred tax assets of approximately million 
however  based on management s analysis of whether it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million was necessary at the end of fiscal year the decision was based on the large loss sustained from continuing operations for the year  the closure of many underperforming restaurants  and the tax net operating loss reported on the company s current year and prior year federal income tax returns 
even though management had implemented a plan to improve cash flow and redeploy capital  the circumstances did not provide evidence that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
therefore  a valuation allowance was established to partially offset the company s federal net operating loss nol carryovers to future years and the company s carryover of federal general business tax credits 
at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would more likely than not be realized 
the negative evidence was that again the company experienced a loss from continuing operations and would report a net operating loss for federal income taxes 
on the positive side  however  the loss for the year was significantly less than in the prior year and expectations were that the improvements would continue as a result of the recent closure of certain under performing restaurants 
also  the company acquired substantially all the assets of fuddruckers at the end of fiscal year with expectations of additional operational income in the future 
management incorporated these factors into projections of future taxable income but could not determine that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized over the projection period 
a valuation allowance was still necessary but not in the same amount as the previous year 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  was necessary 
the valuation allowance partially offset our nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of federal general business tax credits and other credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  was reported as part of the tax benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
on the negative side  the company reported a net operating loss on the federal income tax return of million 
the positive evidence was that the company earned income from continuing operations for the year 
this was a significant improvement over the last two years and indicates the company s cash flow and capital redeployment plan may be working 
even though there were losses in the two prior years  management is more confident that the integration of fuddruckers and improvements in other operations will provide future revenue to allow the utilization of the deferred tax assets 
management incorporated these factors into projections of future taxable income but could not determine at the end of fiscal year that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized over the projection period 
a valuation allowance was still necessary but not in the same amount as the previous year 
management concluded that a valuation allowance of approximately million at august  was necessary at the end of fiscal year the valuation allowance partially offsets our carryover of federal general business tax credits 
the reduction of the valuation allowance from august  is reported as part of the tax expense included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  total deferred tax assets were approximately million 
management reviewed the positive and negative evidence to determine whether these deferred tax assets would be realized 
on the negative side  the company has federal income tax nol carryovers of approximately and general business credit carryovers of approximately million  which will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year and  respectively  if not utilized by then 
on the positive side  the company earned income from continuing operations for fiscal year and has cumulative income from continuing operations for the combined three years ending in fiscal year additionally  the company is estimated to report net taxable income on the fiscal year federal income tax return of approximately million  before the utilization of nol carryovers 
further  management has forecasted the company s future operational performance and taxable 
table of contents income  adjusted by varying probability factors  and anticipates that all of its federal nol carryovers and general business tax carryovers will be fully realized within five years 
this has been a significant improvement and indicates the company s cash flow and capital redeployment plan are working 
management is more confident that the integration of fuddruckers and improvements in other operations will provide sufficient future revenue to allow the utilization of the deferred tax assets 
management incorporated these factors into its evaluation of the realization the deferred tax assets  and has determined that it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  such that a valuation allowance is no longer necessary 
management concluded that the valuation allowance of approximately million should be removed as of the end of fiscal year the reduction of the valuation allowance is reported as part of the tax expense included in income loss from continuing operations for fiscal year two of the most significant items included in deferred tax assets are nol carryovers and general business tax credits 
both of these items may be carried over up to twenty years in the future for possible utilization in the future 
nol amounts carryover beginning in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through fiscal year  if not utilized by then 
the carryover of general business tax credits and other credits were also impacted by amended federal returns  and subsequent to these filings  general business tax credit amounts carryover beginning in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through  if not utilized by then 
the valuation allowance amounts as of fiscal year and partially offset our nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of general business tax credits 
the valuation allowance as of fiscal year partially offset only our carryover of general business tax credits since a valuation allowance on our nol carryovers is no longer necessary  as these assets are more likely than not to be fully realized 
considering continuing operational performance and forecasted taxable income projections  management anticipates the nol carryovers as of the fiscal year ended august  to be realized within five years subsequent 
the reversals of the valuation allowance amounts in fiscal years  and were based upon continued improvement in current and projected operational performance  ability to utilize nol amounts through carryforward and carryback  as well as a declining sustained loss from continuing operations in fiscal year relative to the prior year  and increasing income from continuing operations in fiscal years and this positive and negative evidence was weighed  and in each year an increasing portion of our deferred tax assets was determined to be realizable  on a more likely than not basis  with corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance 
the reductions of the valuation allowance in fiscal years  and are reported as part of the income tax expense or benefit included in income loss from continuing operations for the year 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to examination in these tax jurisdictions  as well as by the internal revenue service irs 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open income tax periods 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets held for use and held for sale  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable 
we analyze historical cash flows of operating locations and compare results of poorer performing locations to more profitable locations 
we also analyze lease terms  condition of the assets and related need for capital expenditures or repairs  construction activity in the surrounding area as well as the economic and market conditions in the surrounding area 
for assets held for use  we estimate future cash flows using assumptions based on possible outcomes of the areas analyzed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of our location s assets  we 
table of contents record an impairment based on an estimate of discounted cash flows 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
assumptions and estimates used include operating results  changes in working capital  discount rate  growth rate  anticipated net proceeds from disposition of the property and if applicable  lease terms 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity to assumptions made 
the time span is longer and could be to years for newer properties  but only to years for older properties 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows 
we operated restaurants as of november  and periodically experience unanticipated changes in our assumptions and estimates 
those changes could have a significant impact on discounted cash flow models with a corresponding significant impact on the measurement of an impairment 
gains are not recognized until the assets are disposed 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  primarily the fuddruckers trademarks and franchise agreements to determine if they are definite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination of useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  contract term  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets  primarily the fuddruckers trademarks and franchise agreements  to determine if events or changes in circumstances such as economic or market conditions indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we analyze historical cash flows of operating locations to determine trends that would indicate a need for impairment 
we also analyze royalties and collectability from our franchisees to determine if there are trends that would indicate a need for impairment 
investments investments included available for sale securities  classified as long term and reported at fair value 
securities available for sale consisted of auction rate securities 
declines in fair value of available for sale securities were analyzed to determine if the decline was temporary or other than temporary 
temporary unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities were excluded from earnings and reported in shareholders equity 
other than temporary declines reduced earnings 
increases in other than temporary declines in fair value were not realized until the securities were sold 
property held for sale we periodically review long lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if we decide to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
we analyze market conditions each reporting period and record additional impairments due to declines in market values of like assets 
the fair value of the property is determined by observable inputs such as appraisals and prices of comparable properties in active markets for assets like ours 
gains are not recognized until the properties are sold 
insurance and claims we self insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under our employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our per occurrence claim exposure 
we have recorded accrued liabilities for self insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 

table of contents the significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self insurance reserves  including incurred but not reported claims  are as follows historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in the past loss development method  historical trend patterns and loss cost levels will continue in the future as they have in the past bornhuetter ferguson method  and historical claim counts and exposures are used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are analyzed to get a projected severity frequency and severity method 
the results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves estimates 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program are not known  and declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program may not continue in future periods 
share based compensation share based compensation is recognized as compensation expense in the income statement utilizing the fair value on the date of the grant 
the fair value of restricted stock units is valued at the closing market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
assumptions for volatility  expected option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield are used in the model

 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this pronouncement was issued to simplify how entities test for impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets 
under this pronouncement  an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
in conclusion of this assessment  if an entity finds that it is not more likely that not than an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  is an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
this pronouncement is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inflation it is generally our policy to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
certain increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  transportation and services may require us to increase our menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting our variable rate debt 
as of august   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations outstanding under our amended new credit facility was million 
assuming an average debt balance of million  a increase in prevailing interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by million 
although we are not currently using interest rate swaps  we have previously used and may in the future use these instruments to manage cash flow risk on a portion of our variable rate debt 
many ingredients in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities  subject to unpredictable price fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients and in some cases by passing increased commodity costs through to the customer by adjusting menu prices or menu offerings 
our ingredients are available from multiple suppliers so we are not dependant on a single vendor for our ingredients
