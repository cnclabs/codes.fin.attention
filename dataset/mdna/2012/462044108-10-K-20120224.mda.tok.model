item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary economic conditions 
systems products our systems segment products include the following marine acquisition systems our marine acquisition system consists of towed marine streamers and shipboard electronics that collect seismic data in water depths greater than meters 
marine streamers  which contain hydrophones  electronic modules and cabling  may measure up to  meters in length and are towed up to at a time behind a towed streamer seismic acquisition vessel 
the hydrophones detect acoustical energy transmitted through water from the earth s subsurface structures 
our digistreamer system  our next generation towed streamer system  uses solid streamer and integrated continuous acquisition technology for towed streamer operations 
we delivered a twelve streamer digistreamer system to bgp in e p companies are showing increased interest in seabed seismic activities for mature fields in which the companies are seeking more detailed reservoir characteristics 
during  we introduced our vectorseis ocean vso system  an advanced system for seismic data acquisition using redeployable ocean bottom cable 
since then  we have sold a total of five vso ocean bottom systems  all sold to reservoir exploration technology  asa rxt  a norwegian seismic contractor 
we made no sales or deliveries of ocean bottom vso systems in or during  we announced the launch of vso ii  which offered significant enhancements over the initial vso system 
we continue to actively develop our seabed technology 
marine positioning systems our digicourse marine streamer positioning system includes streamer cable depth control devices  lateral control devices  compasses  acoustic positioning systems  and other auxiliary sensors 
this equipment is designed to control the vertical and horizontal positioning of the streamer cables and provides acoustic  compass  and depth measurements to allow processors to tie navigation and location data to geophysical data to determine the location of potential hydrocarbon reserves 
digifin is an advanced lateral streamer control system that we commercialized in between and  we have sold and delivered digifin systems  and have completed multiple digifin vessel expansions 
digifin is designed to maintain tighter  more uniform marine streamer separation along the entire length of the streamer cable  which allows for better sampling of seismic data and improved subsurface images 
we believe that digifin also enables faster line changes and minimizes the requirements for in fill seismic work 

table of contents source and source control systems we manufacture and sell air guns  which are the primary seismic energy source used in marine environments to initiate the acoustic energy transmitted through the earth s subsurface 
an air gun fires a high compression burst of air underwater to create an energy wave for seismic measurement 
we offer a digital source control system digishot  which allows for reliable control of air gun arrays for d exploration activities 
geophones geophones are analog sensor devices that measure acoustic energy reflected from rock layers in the earth s subsurface using a mechanical  coil spring element 
we market a full suite of geophones and geophone test equipment that operate in most environments  including land  transition zone  and downhole 
we believe our sensor group is the leading designer and manufacturer of precision analog geophones used in seismic data acquisition 
our analog geophones are used in other industries as well 
software products and services through this segment  we supply command and control software systems and services for towed marine streamer and seabed operations 
software developed by our subsidiary  concept systems  is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide and is a component of many redeployable and permanent seabed monitoring systems 
products and services for our software segment include the following marine imaging orca is our next generation software product for towed streamer navigation and integrated data management applications 
we believe that orca has made significant inroads into the towed streamer market with several major seismic contractors adopting the technology for their new  high end seismic vessels 
we currently estimate our market share to be in excess of  having outfitted our st vessel in during  we outfitted streamer vessels with orca software  a number of these installations were replacements of legacy concept systems products 
orca was initially targeted at larger scale vessels shooting highly complex surveys  but is now making inroads into smaller vessels working in less complex configurations 
orca includes modules designed to manage marine acquisition surveys integrating the navigation  source control  and streamer control functions 
orca manages complex marine surveys such as time lapse d surveys and wats wide azimuth towed streamer surveys 
wats is an advanced acquisition technique for imaging complex structures for example  subsalt formations in the marine environment  generally implemented with multiple source vessels that shoot at some distance from the streamer recording vessel 
orca is designed to function with our digifin product  which enables streamer lateral control  and digistreamer  our new marine streamer acquisition system 
spectra is concept systems legacy integrated navigation and survey control software system for towed streamer based d  d  and d seismic survey operations 
seabed imaging concept systems offers gator  an integrated navigation and data management software system for multi vessel ocean bottom cable and transition zone such as marshlands operations 
the gator system is designed to provide real time  multi vessel positioning and data management solutions for ocean bottom  shallow water  and transition zone crews 
during  concept released its gator ii software system  with enhanced functionality for seabed operations 
the first sale of the new system was concluded in june  it is now available for sale to all seabed clients 
gator ii command and control is designed to meet the unique challenges of distributed  multi vessel seabed  transition zone  and electromagnetic data acquisition 
the system is extremely flexible and scalable to configure and control single vessel operations to highly complex surveys spanning multiple vessels and acquisition systems 
survey design  planning and optimization concept systems offers consulting services for planning  designing and supervising complex surveys  including d and wats survey operations 
concept systems acquisition expertise and in field software platforms and development capability are designed to allow their clients  including oil companies and seismic acquisition contractors  to optimize these complex surveys  improving image quality and reducing costs 
our orca and gator systems are designed to integrate with our post survey tools for processing  analysis  and data quality control  including by our experts use of our reflex software for seismic coverage and attribute analysis  and our optimiser tm technology planning tool 

table of contents inova geophysical products products of inova geophysical include the following land acquisition systems inova now provides two offerings for cableless land acquisition  firefly and hawk 
by removing the constraints of cables  geophysicists can custom design surveys for multiple subsurface targets and increase receiver station density to more fully sample the subsurface 
cableless systems enable contractors to efficiently operate in challenging  culturally intensive environments 
other benefits include a decrease in system weight and  we believe  superior operational efficiencies  reduction in operational troubleshooting time and better defined sampled seismic data 
firefly is inova s radio based cableless system 
it allows for a central location to communicate with the field units via radio and receive information back from the field units 
this communication link allows for management of the equipment on the ground by relaying commands that respond to operational variables 
it also provides valuable quality control information from the field as to the status of the equipment and geophysical attributes 
in  inova geophysical introduced its improved firefly dr system  providing increased ruggedness and protection through an aluminum enclosure  reduced power consumption and support for channel analog or vectorseis digital sensors within the same field electronics 
in  inova geophysical released its hawk sn autonomous node cableless system 
hawk is a lower priced version of firefly that provides a wireless platform without radio infrastructure 
given its simpler infrastructure  it consumes less power in turn increasing battery life 
the straight forward infrastructure is ideal for swift operations or as a complement to cable based or firefly systems 
hawk allows for the use of analog geophones as well as vectorseis digital sensors 
vectorseis is inova s digital multicomponent sensor and it can be used with all of its recording systems 
since  vectorseis full wave technology has been used to acquire seismic data all over the world 
inova geophysical cable based land acquisition systems  scorpion and aries  consist of a central recording unit and multiple remote ground equipment modules that are connected by cable 
the central recording unit is in a transportable enclosure that serves as the control center of each system and is typically mounted within a vehicle 
the central recording unit receives digitized data  stores the data on storage media for subsequent processing and displays the data on optional monitoring devices 
it also provides calibration  status and test functionality 
the remote ground equipment consists of multiple remote modules and line taps positioned over the survey area 
seismic data is collected by analog geophones or vectorseis digital sensors 
inova geophysical aries product line was originally acquired in connection with our acquisition of aram in september the product line consists of analog cable based land acquisition systems and related peripherals and equipment 
aries land system products include remote acquisition modules rams  which acquire seismic data from the sensors and transmit the data digitally to the central processing equipment 
line tap units interconnect baseline cables from the recording equipment to multiple receiver lines and function to retransmit data from the rams to central recording equipment 
aries products also include system batteries  central recording equipment  and baseline cables that connect the central recording equipment with the taps and receiver line cables 
the latest version of aries the aries ii land recording system features a bit system architecture that is designed to dramatically improve channel capacity  ensure efficient equipment deployment  and maximize system performance 
it is also enabled to work with analog geophones and vectorseis digital sensors and provides continuous recording functionality for microseismic and high productivity vibroseis operations 
aries ii supports high channel count  source driven  high productivity vibroseis acquisition 
the scorpion system is also capable of recording digital multicomponent seismic data  as well as analog data 
digital sensors can provide increased response linearity and bandwidth  which translate into higher resolution images of the subsurface 
in addition  one digital sensor can replace a string of six or more analog geophones  providing users with equipment weight reduction and improved operating efficiencies 

table of contents source products vibrators are devices carried by large vehicles and  along with dynamite  are used as energy sources for land seismic acquisition 
inova geophysical markets and sells the ahv iv  a line of articulated tire based vibrator vehicles  and a tracked vibrator  the xvib  for use in environmentally sensitive areas such as the arctic tundra and desert environments 
during  inova launched the univib  a smaller vibrator with up to  lb peak force that allows easier mobility and offers options for vibroseis or accelerated impulse source generation 
inova geophysical is also a provider of energy source control and positioning technologies 
the vib pro control system provides vibrator vehicles with digital technology for energy control and global positioning system technology for navigation and positioning 
the shot pro dynamite firing system  released in  is the equivalent technology for seismic operations using dynamite energy sources 
product research and development our research and development efforts have focused on improving both the quality of the subsurface image and the seismic data acquisition economics for our customers 
our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic equipment and data acquisition systems  as well as related processing services  depends principally upon continued technological innovation 
development cycles of most products  from initial conception through commercial introduction  may extend over several years 
during  our product development efforts continued across selective business lines aimed at the development of strategic key products and technologies 
a large part of our research and development efforts in were focused on development of our digi line of marine streamers and our other marine technologies 
also  in our data processing business  we are investing in continued improvements in productivity and in enhancing our applications to handle increasingly complex data acquisition environments and difficult to image geology 
we also expect to devote increasing research and development emphasis on shale play technologies and marine seabed platform technologies 
for a summary of our research and development expenditures during the past five years  see item selected financial data below 
because many of these new products and services are under development  their commercial feasibility or degree of commercial acceptance is not yet established 
no assurance can be given concerning the successful development of any new products or services  any enhancements to them  the specific timing of their release or their level of acceptance in the marketplace 
markets and customers based on historical revenues  we believe that we are a market leader in seismic data acquisition in the arctic and in numerous product lines  including full wave sensors based upon micro electro magnetic systems mems  navigation and data management software  marine positioning and streamer control systems  redeployable seabed recording systems and  through inova geophysical  cableless land acquisition systems 
our principal customers are oil companies  seismic contractors and e p companies 
we market and sell products and offer services directly to e p companies  primarily imaging related processing services from our gxt subsidiary and multi client seismic data libraries from our geoventures group  as well as consulting services from concept systems and gxt 
seismic contractors purchase our data acquisition systems and related equipment and software to collect data in accordance with their e p company customers specifications or for their own seismic data libraries 
during  and  no single customer accounted for or more of our consolidated net revenues 
a significant part of our marketing effort is focused on areas outside of the united states 
foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the united states  including the risk of armed conflict  civil disturbances  currency fluctuations  embargo and governmental activities  customer credit risks  and risk of non compliance with us and foreign laws  including tariff regulations and import export restrictions 
we sell our products and services through a direct sales force consisting of employees and international third party sales representatives responsible for key geographic areas 
during  and  sales to destinations outside of north america accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net revenues  respectively 
further  systems sold to domestic customers are frequently deployed internationally and  from time to time  certain foreign sales require export licenses 

table of contents traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
for information concerning the geographic breakdown of our net revenues  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
manufacturing outsourcing and suppliers since  we have increased the use of contract manufacturers in our systems segment as an alternative to manufacturing our own products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables and various components of vectorseis ocean 
we may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if we do not monitor these relationships properly 
competition the gxt imaging solutions group within our solutions segment competes with more than a dozen processing companies that are capable of providing pre stack depth migration services to e p companies 
see products and services solutions services 
while the barriers to entry into this market are relatively low  the barriers to competing at the higher end of the market  the advanced pre stack depth migration market where our efforts are focused  are significantly higher 
at the higher end of this market  compagnie general de geophysique veritas cggveritas and westerngeco llc a wholly owned subsidiary of schlumberger limited  a large integrated oilfield services company are our solutions segment s two primary competitors for advanced imaging services 
both of these companies are larger than ion in terms of revenues  number of processing locations  and sales  marketing and financial resources 
in addition  both cggveritas and westerngeco possess an advantage of being part of affiliated seismic contractor companies  providing them with access to customer relationships and seismic datasets that require processing 
the gxt imaging solutions group also competes with companies that are capable of performing data processing services via internal resources 
the market for seismic products and services is highly competitive and is characterized by continual changes in technology 
our principal competitor for land and marine seismic equipment is societe d etudes recherches et construction electroniques sercel  an affiliate of the french seismic contractor  cggveritas 
sercel possesses the advantage of being able to sell its products and services to an affiliated seismic contractor that operates both land crews and seismic acquisition vessels  providing it with a greater ability to test new technology in the field and to capture a captive internal market for product sales 
sercel has also demonstrated that it is willing to offer extended financing sales terms to customers in situations where we declined to do so due to credit risk 
we also compete with other seismic equipment companies on a product by product basis 
our ability to compete effectively in the manufacture and sale of seismic instruments and data acquisition systems depends principally upon continued technological innovation  as well as pricing  system reliability  reputation for quality  and ability to deliver on schedule 
certain seismic contractors have designed  engineered  and manufactured seismic acquisition technology in house or through a controlled network of third party vendors in order to achieve differentiation versus their competition 
for example  westerngeco relies heavily on its in house technology development for designing  engineering  and manufacturing its q technology platform  which includes seismic acquisition and processing systems 
although this technology competes directly with ion s technology for marine streamer  seabed  and land acquisition  westerngeco does not provide q technology services to other seismic acquisition contractors 
however  the risk exists that other seismic contractors may decide to conduct more of their own seismic technology development  which would put additional pressures on the demand for ion acquisition equipment products 
in addition  over the last several years  we have seen both new build and consolidation activity within the marine towed streamer segment  which could impact our business results in the future 
we expect the number of d and d marine streamer vessels  including those in operation  under construction  or announced additions to capacity  to increase by  to approximately in compared to approximately at december  we understand that out of these estimated vessels will be outfitted to perform d seismic survey work 
in addition  there has been an increase in acquisition activity within the sector  with the major vessel operators schlumberger  cggveritas  and petroleum geo services asa pgs all moving to acquire new market entrants in the last several years 
many of these incumbent operators develop their own marine streamer technologies  such that consolidation in the sector reduces the number of potential customers and vessel outfitting opportunities for us 

table of contents concept systems provides advanced data integration software and services to seismic contractors acquiring data using either towed streamer vessels or ocean bottom cable on the seabed 
vessels or ocean bottom cable crews that do not use concept systems software either rely upon manual data integration  reconciliation  and quality control  or develop and maintain their own proprietary software packages 
there is growing competition to concept systems core command and control business from sercel and other smaller companies 
concept systems has signed long term between two and five years technology partnerships with many of its key clients and will continue to seek to develop key new technologies with these clients 
an important competitive factor for companies in the same business as concept systems is the ability to provide advanced complex command and control software with a high level of reliability combined with expert systems and project support to ensure operations run cost effectively 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies 
although our portfolio of patents is considered important to our operations  and particular patents may be material to specific business lines  no one patent is considered essential to our consolidated business operations 
our patents  copyrights  and trademarks offer us only limited protection 
our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  or may design around the proprietary features of our products 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs 
our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
from time to time  third parties inquire and claim that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights and we make similar inquiries and claims to third parties 
no material liabilities have resulted from these third party claims to date

regulatory matters our operations are subject to various international conventions  laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate  including laws and regulations relating to the importation of and operation of seismic equipment  currency conversions and repatriation  oil and gas exploration and development  taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel  environmental protection  the use of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors and duties on the importation and exportation of equipment 
our operations are subject to government policies and product certification requirements worldwide 
governments in some foreign countries have become increasingly active in regulating the companies holding concessions  the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industries in their countries 
in some areas of the world  this governmental activity has adversely affected the amount of exploration and development work done by major oil and gas companies and may continue to do so 
operations in less developed countries can be subject to legal systems that are not as mature or predictable as those in more developed countries  which can lead to greater uncertainty in legal matters and proceedings 

table of contents changes in these conventions  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products and services or result in the need to modify them  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to trade restrictions  embargoes  and sanctions imposed by the us government 
these restrictions and sanctions prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
while we have experienced an increase in general environmental regulation worldwide and laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent  we do not believe compliance with these regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations  and we do not currently foresee the need for significant expenditures to ensure our continued compliance with current environmental protection laws 
regulations in this area are subject to change  and there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us 
the deepwater horizon incident in the us gulf of mexico in april resulted in a moratorium on certain offshore drilling activities by the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement  or boemre 
this moratorium and other regulatory initiatives in response to this incident adversely affected decisions of e p companies to explore and drill in the gulf of mexico  and negatively impacted our solutions segment during the second half of and during this time period  we experienced a significant reduction in data processing revenues attributable to the gulf of mexico 
the boemre has issued and is expected to issue additional new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the gulf of mexico and other offshore regions  and may take other steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production  reduce the area of operations  and result in permitting delays 
the deepwater horizon incident is likely to have a significant and lasting effect on the us offshore energy industry  and will likely result in a number of fundamental changes  including heightened regulatory scrutiny  more stringent operating and safety standards  changes in equipment requirements and the availability and cost of insurance  as well as increased politicization of the industry 
these changes may result in increases in our and our customers operating costs 
we do not engage in hydraulic fracturing services  a commonly used process in the completion of oil and natural gas wells  particularly in low permeability formations such as shales  that involves the injection of water  proppants  and chemicals under pressure into the target reservoir to stimulate hydrocarbon production 
our business  however  is highly dependent on the level of activity by our oil and gas exploration and production customers  and hydrocarbons cannot be economically produced from certain reservoirs without extensive fracturing 
due to public concerns about any environmental impact that hydraulic fracturing may have  including potential impairment of groundwater quality  legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal  state  and local levels have been initiated to impose more stringent permitting and compliance obligations on such operations 
in the us congress  for example  there is a pending bill entitled the fracturing responsibility and awareness of chemicals act  or the frac act  that would amend the federal safe drinking water act  or the sdwa  to repeal an existing exemption from underground injection control permitting for hydraulic fracturing that does not utilize diesel fuels 
in early  the us environmental protection agency the epa indicated that it intended to regulate hydraulic fracturing utilizing diesel fuels under the sdwa and require permitting for any well where such hydraulic fracturing was conducted 
while industry groups have challenged the epa s action as improper rulemaking  the agency s position  if upheld  could result in additional permitting 
the epa also has commenced a study of the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health  indicated that it intends to develop standards for discharges of hydraulic fracturing wastewaters  proposed air standards for certain hydraulic fracturing operations  and initiated a process for collecting health information and other data about fracturing additives 
separately  the united states department of the interior has announced its intention to propose new rules regulating hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands  including requirements for disclosure  well bore integrity  and handling of flowback water 
a number of state and local governments  moreover  have adopted or are considering adopting additional requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing 
any legislative and regulatory initiatives imposing significant additional restrictions on  or otherwise limiting  the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult or costly to complete natural gas and oil wells 
in the event such requirements are enacted  demand for our shale data libraries and seismic acquisition services may be adversely affected 

table of contents our customers operations are also significantly impacted in other respects by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
for instance  many of our marine contractors have been affected by regulations protecting marine mammals in the gulf of mexico 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
employees as of december   we had regular  full time employees  of whom were located in the us from time to time and on an as needed basis  we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or as independent contractors in order to meet certain internal manufacturing or other business needs 
our us employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a labor related work stoppage 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory

these forward looking statements reflect our best judgment about future events and trends based on the information currently available to us 
our results of operations can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we make or by risks and uncertainties known or unknown to us 
therefore  we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the forward looking statements 
actual events and results of operations may vary materially from our current expectations and assumptions 
while we cannot identify all of the factors that may cause actual results to vary from our expectations  we believe the following factors should be considered carefully as a technology focused company  we are continually exposed to risks related to complex  highly technical products and services 
we have made  and we will continue to make  strategic decisions from time to time as to the technologies in which we invest  and if we choose the wrong technology  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our operating results are dependent upon our ability to improve and refine our seismic imaging services and to successfully develop  manufacture  and market our products and other services and products 
new technologies generally require a substantial investment before any assurance is available as to their commercial viability 
if we choose the wrong technology  or if our competitors develop or select a superior technology  we could lose our existing customers and be unable to attract new customers  which would harm our business and operations 
the markets for our services and products are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions 
we must invest substantial capital to develop and maintain a leading edge in technology  with no assurance that we will receive an adequate rate of return on those investments 
if we are unable to develop and produce successfully and timely new or enhanced products and services  we will be unable to compete in the future and our business  our results of operations and our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
our business could suffer from unexpected developments in technology  or from our failure to adapt to these changes 
in addition  the preferences and requirements of customers can change rapidly 

table of contents the businesses of our solutions and software segments  being more concentrated in software  processing services  and proprietary technologies  have also exposed us to various risks that these technologies typically encounter  including the following future competition from more established companies entering the market  technology obsolescence  dependence upon continued growth of the market for seismic data processing  the rate of change in the markets for these segments technology and services  research and development efforts not proving sufficient to keep up with changing market demands  dependence on third party software for inclusion in these segments products and services  misappropriation of these segments technology by other companies  alleged or actual infringement of intellectual property rights that could result in substantial additional costs  difficulties inherent in forecasting sales for newly developed technologies or advancements in technologies  recruiting  training  and retaining technically skilled personnel that could increase the costs for these segments  or limit their growth  and the ability to maintain traditional margins for certain of their technology or services 
seismic data acquisition and data processing technologies historically have progressed rather rapidly  and we expect this progression to continue 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to invest additional capital to maintain  upgrade and expand our seismic data acquisition and processing capabilities 
however  due to potential advances in technology and the related costs associated with such technological advances  we may not be able to fulfill this strategy  thus possibly affecting our ability to compete 
our customers often require demanding specifications for performance and reliability of our products and services 
because many of our products are complex and often use unique advanced components  processes  technologies  and techniques  undetected errors and design and manufacturing flaws may occur 
even though we attempt to assure that our systems are always reliable in the field  the many technical variables related to their operations can cause a combination of factors that can  and have from time to time  caused performance and service issues with certain of our products 
product defects result in higher product service  warranty  and replacement costs and may affect our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may adversely impact our results of operations 
despite our testing and quality assurance programs  undetected errors may not be discovered until the product is purchased and used by a customer in a variety of field conditions 
if our customers deploy our new products and they do not work correctly  our relationship with our customers may be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our systems advanced and complex nature  we expect to experience occasional operational issues from time to time 
generally  until our products have been tested in the field under a wide variety of operational conditions  we cannot be certain that performance and service problems will not arise 
in that case  market acceptance of our new products could be delayed and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we are subject to intense competition  which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or to maintain our prices at profitable levels 
many of our sales are obtained through a competitive bidding process  which is standard for our industry 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  technological expertise  and a reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
while no single company competes with us in all of our segments  we are subject to intense competition in each of our segments 
new entrants in many of the markets in which certain of our products and services are currently strong should be expected 
see item business competition 
we compete with companies that are larger than we are in terms of revenues  number of processing locations and sales and marketing resources 
a few of our competitors have a competitive advantage in being part of an affiliated seismic contractor company 
in addition  we compete with major service providers and government sponsored enterprises and affiliates 
some of our competitors conduct seismic data acquisition operations as part of their regular business  which we do not  and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
these and other competitors may be better positioned to withstand and adjust more quickly to volatile market conditions  such as fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices  as well as changes in government regulations 
in addition  any excess supply of products and services in the seismic services market could apply downward pressure on prices for our products and services 
the negative effects of the competitive environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we may be unable to obtain broad intellectual property protection for our current and future products and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies 
we believe that the technological and creative skill of our employees  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition  and reliable product maintenance are the foundations of our competitive advantage 
although we have a considerable portfolio of patents  copyrights  and trademarks  these property rights offer us only limited protection 
our competitors may attempt to copy aspects of our products despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  or may design around the proprietary features of our products 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which such use occurs 
our difficulties are compounded in certain foreign countries where the laws do not offer as much protection for proprietary rights as the laws of the united states 
third parties inquire and claim from time to time that we have infringed upon their intellectual property rights 
many of our competitors own their own extensive global portfolio of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  and other intellectual property to protect their proprietary technologies 
we believe that we have in place appropriate procedures and safeguards to help ensure that we do not violate a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  no set of procedures and safeguards is infallible 
we may unknowingly and inadvertently take action that is inconsistent with a third party s intellectual property rights  despite our efforts to do otherwise 
any such claims from third parties  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  result in injunctions  require product modifications  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
such claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
much of our litigation in recent years have involved disputes over our and others rights to technology 
see item legal proceedings 
our inova geophysical joint venture with bgp involves numerous risks 
our inova geophysical joint venture with bgp is focused on designing  engineering  manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing and field support of land based equipment used in seismic data acquisition for the oil and gas industry 
excluded from the scope of the joint venture s business are the analog sensor businesses of our company and bgp and the businesses of certain companies in which bgp or we are currently a minority owner 
in addition to these excluded businesses  all of our other businesses including our systems and software segments and our solutions division  which includes our imaging solutions  geoventures and basinspan and seismic data library businesses remain owned and operated by us and do not comprise a part of the joint venture 
the inova geophysical joint venture involves the integration of multiple product lines and business models contributed by us and bgp that previously have operated independently 
this has been and will continue to be a complex and time consuming process 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the expected benefits of the joint venture 
the inova geophysical joint venture and any future joint ventures or acquisitions that we may complete  may result in unexpected costs  expenses  and liabilities  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
inova geophysical may encounter difficulties in developing and expanding its business 
we may experience difficulties in funding any future capital contributions to the joint venture  exercising influence over the management and activities of the joint venture  quality control over joint venture products and services and potential conflicts of interest with the joint venture and our joint venture partner 
any inability to meet our obligations as a joint venture partner under the joint venture agreement could result in our being subject to penalties and reduced percentage interests in the joint venture for our company 
also  we could be disadvantaged in the event of disputes and controversies with our joint venture partner  since our joint venture partner is a relatively significant customer of our products and services and future products and services of the joint venture as well as a shareholder of of our common stock 

table of contents the joint venture is also subject to  and exposes us to  various additional risks that could adversely affect our results of operations 
these risks include the following increased costs associated with the integration and operation of the new business and the management of geographically dispersed operations  risks associated with the assimilation of new technologies including incorporating bgp s land seismic equipment with our existing land seismic imaging product lines that were contributed to the joint venture  operations  sites  and personnel 
in and  inova geophysical has had significant write downs of inventory from the time of the joint venture formation  difficulties in retaining and integrating key technical  sales and marketing personnel and the possible loss of such employees and costs associated with their loss  difficulties associated with preserving relationships with our customers  partners and vendors  risks that any technology developed by the joint venture may not perform as well as we had anticipated  the diversion of management s attention and other resources from other business operations and related concerns  the potential inability to replicate operating efficiencies in the joint venture s operations  potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets  the requirement to maintain uniform standards  controls and procedures  the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of the integration of management personnel from different companies  the divergence of our interests from bgp s interests in the future  disagreements with bgp on ongoing manufacturing  research and development and operational activities  or the amount  timing or nature of further investments in the joint venture  the terms of our joint venture arrangements may turn out to be unfavorable to us  we currently own of the total equity interests in inova geophysical  so there are certain decisions affecting the business of the joint venture that we cannot control or influence  we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies  cost savings or other benefits that we expect from the joint venture  the joint venture s cash flows may be inadequate to fund its capital requirements  thereby requiring additional contributions to the capital of the joint venture by us and by bgp  joint venture profits and cash flows may prove inadequate to fund cash dividends from the joint venture to the joint venture partners  and the joint venture may experience difficulties and delays in production of the joint venture s products 
if the inova geophysical joint venture is not successful  our business  results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected 
in addition  the terms of the joint venture s governing instruments and the agreements regarding bgp s investment in our company contain a number of restrictive provisions affecting ion 
for example  an investors rights agreement grants pre emptive rights to bgp with respect to certain future issuances of our stock 
these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to quickly raise funds through a future issuance of our securities  and could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition of our company that our stockholders may otherwise consider to be favorable 

table of contents continued depressed general economic conditions  credit market uncertainties and lower natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on customer demand for certain of our products and services  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations  our cash flows  our financial condition and our stock price 
the global recession resulting from the financial crisis contributed to weakened demand and lower prices for natural gas on a worldwide basis  which reduced the levels of exploration for natural gas 
historically  demand for our products and services has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by e p companies and geophysical contractors 
the demand for our products and services will be reduced if exploration expenditures remain low 
during periods of reduced levels of exploration for oil and natural gas  there have been oversupplies of seismic data and downward pricing pressures on our seismic products and services  which in turn  have limited our ability to meet sales objectives and maintain profit margins for our products and services 
in the past  these then prevailing industry conditions have had the effect of reducing our revenues and operating margins 
the markets for oil and gas historically have been volatile and may continue to be so in the future 
turmoil or uncertainty in the credit markets and its potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings under either existing or new debt facilities in the public or private markets and on terms we believe to be reasonable 
likewise  there can be no assurance that our customers will be able to borrow money on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  which could have a negative impact on their demand for our products and impair their ability to pay us for our products and services on a timely basis  or at all 
our sales are affected by interest rate fluctuations and the availability of liquidity  and we would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints 
rising interest rates may also make certain alternative products and services provided by our competitors more attractive to customers  which could lead to a decline in demand for our products and services 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales  which pose additional risks 
sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues for  and we believe that export sales will remain a significant percentage of our revenue 
us export restrictions affect the types and specifications of products we can export 
additionally  to complete certain sales  us laws may require us to obtain export licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty in obtaining these licenses 
like many energy services companies  we have operations in and sales into certain international areas  including parts of the middle east  west africa  latin america  asia pacific and the commonwealth of independent states  that are subject to risks of war  political disruption such as the political turmoil during in tunisia  egypt and libya  civil disturbance  political corruption  possible economic and legal sanctions such as possible restrictions against countries that the us government may deem to sponsor terrorism and changes in global trade policies 
our sales or operations may become restricted or prohibited in any country in which the foregoing risks occur 
in particular  the occurrence of any of these risks could result in the following events  which in turn  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations disruption of oil and natural gas e p activities  restriction on the movement and exchange of funds  inhibition of our ability to collect receivables  enactment of additional or stricter us government or international sanctions  limitation of our access to markets for periods of time  expropriation and nationalization of assets of our company or those of our customers  political and economic instability  which may include armed conflict and civil disturbance  currency fluctuations  devaluations  and conversion restrictions  
table of contents confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies  and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights 
our international operations and sales increase our exposure to other countries restrictive tariff regulations  other import export restrictions and customer credit risk 
in addition  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide 
our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities  and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or interest 
the drilling moratorium in the us gulf of mexico and the other regulatory initiatives undertaken in response to the deepwater horizon disaster and resulting oil spill in the us gulf of mexico  has adversely affected  and could adversely affect in the future  our customers and our business 
in april  the deepwater horizon drilling rig in the us gulf of mexico sank following a catastrophic explosion and fire  which resulted in the release of millions of gallons of hydrocarbons 
in response to this incident  the minerals management service now known as the boemre of the us department of the interior issued a notice on may  implementing a six month moratorium on certain drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico 
the moratorium was lifted in october  but the boemre has issued and is expected to issue new safety and environmental guidelines or regulations for drilling in the gulf of mexico and in other us offshore locations 
in addition  as a result of these changes  the permitting process for exploration and development activities in the us gulf of mexico slowed considerably  resulting in very limited levels of activity there 
these new safety and environmental regulations will expose our customers  and could expose us  to significant additional costs and liabilities 
in addition  these and any such similar future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions that may adversely affect the financial health of our customers or decrease the demand for our products and services 
while certain new drilling plans and drilling permits were approved during  we cannot predict when the pace at which operators in the us gulf of mexico will be able to satisfy these requirements and return to previous levels of active drilling 
further  we cannot predict what the continuing effects from the us government regulations on offshore deepwater drilling projects may have on offshore oil and gas exploration and development activity  or what actions may be taken by our customers or other industry participants in response to these regulations 
changes in laws or regulations regarding offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities and decisions by customers and other industry participants could reduce demand for our products and services  which would have a negative impact on our operations 
a prolonged suspension of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico  new regulations and increased liability for companies operating in this sector would adversely affect many of our customers who operate in the gulf 
this could  in turn  adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition  particularly regarding sales of our marine seismic equipment and our solutions segment s survey and processing activities 
our solutions segment was negatively impacted during and into by its experiencing a reduction in data processing business from the gulf of mexico and new venture and multi client seismic data library sales from our gulfspan seismic dataset 
the uncertainties that have resulted from the incident s aftermath adversely affect us  our customers and other providers of equipment and services to e p companies  due to the lack of visibility as to which companies will continue to be active in us gulf of mexico deepwater exploration and development 
as a result  we cannot currently predict the extent to which these events may adversely affect our future business  the extent and length of time that any such adverse impact will be felt 

table of contents our business depends on the level of exploration and production activities by the oil and natural gas industry 
if oil and natural gas prices or the level of capital expenditures by e p companies were to decline  demand for our products and services would decline and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
demand for our products and services depends upon the level of spending by e p companies and seismic contractors for exploration and development activities  and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices 
spending by our customers on products and services that we provide is highly discretionary in nature  and subject to rapid and material change 
any significant decline in oil and gas related spending on behalf of our customers could cause alterations in our capital spending plans  project modifications  delays or cancellations  general business disruptions or delays in payment  or non payment of amounts that are owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to continue to satisfy all of the covenants in our loan agreements 
additionally  increases in oil and gas prices may not increase demand for our products and services or otherwise have a positive effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
e p companies willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control  such as the supply of and demand for oil and gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the expected rates of decline for current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area  as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic data acquisition  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil and gas producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  government policies regarding the exploration  production and development of oil and gas reserves  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas companies and seismic contractors 
although we believe that the long term trend is favorable  the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity has been volatile in recent years 
previously forecasted trends in oil and gas exploration and development activities may not continue and demand for our products and services may not reflect the level of activity in the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas production levels and therefore adversely affect demand for the products and services we provide 
if we do not effectively manage our transition into new products and services  our revenues may suffer 
products and services for the seismic industry are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance  software functionality and features  frequent introduction of new products and services  and improvement in price characteristics relative to product and service performance 
among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing  variations in costs  delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions  write offs or write downs of the carrying costs of inventory and raw materials associated with prior generation products  difficulty in predicting customer demand for new product and service offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand  risks associated with customer qualification  evaluation of new products  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software 
the introduction of new products and services by our competitors also may result in delays in customer purchases and difficulty in predicting customer demand 
if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings  our revenues and margins may decline 

table of contents furthermore  sales of our new products and services may replace sales  or result in discounting of some of our current product or service offerings  offsetting the benefit of a successful introduction 
in addition  it may be difficult to ensure performance of new products and services in accordance with our revenue  margin  and cost estimations and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates 
given the competitive nature of the seismic industry  if any of these risks materializes  future demand for our products and services  and our future results of operations  may suffer 
we invest significant sums of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our solutions multi client data library 
we invest significant amounts in acquiring and processing new seismic data to add to our solutions multi client data library 
a majority of these investments are funded by our customers  while the remainder is recovered through future data licensing fees 
in  we invested million in our multi client data library 
our customers generally commit to licensing the data prior to our initiating a new data library acquisition program 
however  the aggregate amounts of future licensing fees for this data are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors  including the market prices of oil and gas  customer demand for seismic data in the library  and the availability of similar data from competitors 
by making these investments in acquiring and processing new seismic data for our solutions multi client library  we are exposed to the following risks we may not fully recover our costs of acquiring and processing seismic data through future sales 
the ultimate amounts involved in these data sales are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the timing of these sales is unpredictable and can vary greatly from period to period 
the costs of each survey are capitalized and then amortized as a percentage of sales and or over the expected useful life of the data 
this amortization will affect our earnings and  when combined with the sporadic nature of sales  will result in increased earnings volatility 
regulatory changes that affect companies ability to drill  either generally or in a specific location where we have acquired seismic data  could materially adversely affect the value of the seismic data contained in our library 
technology changes could also make existing data sets obsolete 
additionally  each of our individual surveys has a limited book life based on its location and oil and gas companies interest in prospecting for reserves in such location  so a particular survey may be subject to a significant decline in value beyond our initial estimates 
the value of our multi client data could be significantly adversely affected if any material adverse change occurs in the general prospects for oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
the cost estimates upon which we base our pre commitments of funding could be wrong 
the result could be losses that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these pre commitments of funding are subject to the creditworthiness of our clients 
in the event that a client refuses or is unable to pay its commitment  we could incur a substantial loss on that project 
as part of our asset light strategy  we routinely charter vessels from third party vendors to acquire seismic data for our multi client business 
as a result  our cost to acquire our multi client data could significantly increase if vessel charter prices rise materially 
any reduction in the market value of such data will require us to write down its recorded value  which could have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period  and we are subject to seasonality factors 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations from period to period as a result of new product or service introductions  the timing of significant expenses in connection with customer orders  unrealized sales  levels of research and development activities in different periods  the product mix sold  and the seasonality of our business 
because many of our products feature a high sales price and are technologically complex  we generally have experienced long sales cycles for these products and historically incur significant expense at the beginning of these cycles for component parts and other inventory necessary to manufacture a product in anticipation of a future sale  which may not ultimately occur 
in addition  the revenues from our sales can vary widely from period 
table of contents to period due to changes in customer requirements and demand 
these factors can create fluctuations in our net revenues and results of operations from period to period 
variability in our overall gross margins for any period  which depend on the percentages of higher margin and lower margin products and services sold in that period  compounds these uncertainties 
as a result  if net revenues or gross margins fall below expectations  our results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected 
additionally  our business can be seasonal in nature  with strongest demand typically in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
customer budgeting cycles at times result in higher spending activity levels by our customers at different points of the year 
due to the relatively high sales price of many of our products and seismic data libraries  our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated from period to period due to the timing of orders and shipments and the mix of products and services sold 
this uneven pattern makes financial predictions for any given period difficult  increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition  and places challenges on our inventory management 
delays caused by factors beyond our control  such as the granting of permits for seismic surveys by third parties  the effect from disasters such as the deepwater horizon incident in the gulf of mexico and the availability and equipping of marine vessels  can affect our solutions segment s revenues from its processing and geoventures services from period to period 
also  delays in ordering products or in shipping or delivering products in a given period could significantly affect our results of operations for that period 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause greater volatility in the market price of our common stock 
the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have traditionally relied on a relatively small number of significant customers 
consequently  our business is exposed to the risks related to customer concentration 
no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for  and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues during those years 
the loss of any of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
during the last ten years  our traditional seismic contractor customers have been rapidly consolidating  thereby consolidating the demand for our products and services 
the loss of any of our significant customers to further consolidation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile from time to time  declining precipitously from time to time during the period from through  and it could decline again 
the securities markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility in recent years 
the market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to experience significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects or those of companies in our industry 
in addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section  the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  factors influencing the levels of global oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation activities  such as depressed prices for natural gas in north america or disasters such as the deepwater horizon incident in the gulf of mexico in  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors or analysts consider comparable to us  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  and changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions  such as interest rates  commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets 

table of contents to the extent that the price of our common stock remains at lower levels or it declines further  our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced 
in addition  further increases in our leverage may make it more difficult for us to access additional capital 
these factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans 
if we  our option holders or stockholders holding registration rights sell additional shares of our common stock in the future  the market price of our common stock could decline 
additionally  our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock are convertible into shares of our common stock 
the conversion of the series d preferred stock and exercise of our stock options could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
sales in the open market of the shares of common stock acquired upon such conversion or exercises may have the effect of reducing the then current market price for our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future  or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
as of february   we had  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
substantially all of these shares are available for sale in the public market  subject in some cases to volume and other limitations or delivery of a prospectus 
at february   we had outstanding stock options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we also had  as of that date   shares of common stock reserved for issuance under outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
during we issued in a privately negotiated transaction million shares of our common stock to certain institutional investors 
in march we issued million shares to bgp in a privately negotiated transaction in connection with the formation of our inova geophysical joint venture 
these shares may be resold into the public markets in sale transactions pursuant to currently effective registration statements filed with the sec 
sales in the public market of a large number of shares of common stock could apply downward pressure on the prevailing market price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of such sales in the public markets in the future  or the perception that such sales could occur 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
as of february   fletcher international  ltd  the holder of our series d preferred stock  held  shares of our series d cumulative convertible preferred stock and  shares of our series d cumulative convertible preferred stock 
under the terms of the agreement with fletcher by which it purchased the series d preferred stock  fletcher has the ability to sell  under currently effective registration statements  the shares of our common stock acquired by it upon conversion of its remaining shares of series d preferred stock 
the shares of our series d preferred stock held by fletcher as of february  are convertible into  shares of our common stock 
the conversion of our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
sales in the public market of shares of common stock issued upon conversion would likely apply downward pressure on prevailing market prices of our common stock 
the conversion price of our outstanding series d preferred stock is also subject to certain customary anti dilution adjustments 
for additional information regarding the terms of our series d preferred stock  see note cumulative convertible preferred stock of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
we currently have ongoing litigation with fletcher in delaware regarding issues involving our series d preferred stock 
for more information regarding our litigation with fletcher  see item legal proceedings 
shares of our common stock are also subject to certain demand and piggyback registration rights held by laitram  llc we also may enter into additional registration rights agreements in the future in connection with any subsequent acquisitions or securities transactions we may undertake 
any sales of our common stock under these registration rights arrangements with laitram or other stockholders could be negatively perceived in the trading markets and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market under these arrangements  or the expectation of such sales  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions are subject to impairment evaluations and  as a result  we could be required to write off additional goodwill and intangible assets  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets asc  we are required to compare the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets when certain impairment indicators under asc are present to their carrying amount 
if the fair value of such goodwill or intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of these assets within the reporting units is less than their carrying value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our goodwill and intangible assets and in we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our intangible assets 
any further reduction in or impairment of the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
at december   our goodwill and other intangible asset balances were million and million  respectively 
due to the international scope of our business activities  our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from international sales  subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including the united kingdom  china  canada  the netherlands  brazil  russia  the united arab emirates  egypt and other countries 
certain of these countries have experienced geopolitical instability  economic problems and other uncertainties from time to time 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world  or the collectability of receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in certain higher risk countries to provide their own financing 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries where we perceive excessive credit risk 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within the united kingdom 
our subsidiaries in the uk and in other countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in their local currencies 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in their local currencies  a devaluation of those currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
for financial reporting purposes  such depreciation will negatively affect our reported results of operations since earnings denominated in foreign currencies would be converted to us dollars at a decreased value 
in addition  since we participate in competitive bids for sales of certain of our products and services that are denominated in us dollars  a depreciation of the us dollar against other currencies could harm our competitive position relative to other companies 
while we have employed economic cash flow and fair value hedges to minimize the risks associated with these exchange rate fluctuations  the hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the values of the currencies of countries in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations 
we rely on highly skilled personnel in our businesses  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate  and retain skilled personnel for all areas of our organization 
we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our businesses 
competition for qualified personnel required for our data processing operations and our other segments businesses has intensified in recent years 
our growth has presented challenges to us to recruit  train  and retain our employees while managing the impact of potential wage inflation and the lack of 
table of contents available qualified labor in some markets where we operate 
a well trained  motivated and adequately staffed work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees 
certain of our facilities could be damaged by hurricanes and other natural disasters  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our facilities are located in regions of the united states that are susceptible to damage from hurricanes and other weather events  and  during  were impacted by hurricanes or other weather events 
our systems segment leases  square feet of facilities located in harahan  louisiana  in the greater new orleans metropolitan area 
in late august  we suspended operations at these facilities and evacuated and locked down the facilities in preparation for hurricane katrina 
these facilities did not experience flooding or significant damage during or after the hurricane 
however  because of employee evacuations  power failures and lack of related support services  utilities and infrastructure in the new orleans area  we were unable to resume full operations at the facilities until late september in september  we lost power and related services for several days at our offices located in the houston metropolitan area  which includes a substantial portion of our data processing infrastructure  and in harahan  louisiana as a result of hurricane ike and hurricane gustav 
future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact our facilities may negatively affect our financial position and operating results for those periods 
these negative effects may include reduced production  product sales and data processing revenues  costs associated with resuming production  reduced orders for our products and services from customers that were similarly affected by these events  lost market share  late deliveries  additional costs to purchase materials and supplies from outside suppliers  uninsured property losses  inadequate business interruption insurance and an inability to retain necessary staff 
to the extent that climate change increases the severity of hurricanes and other weather events  as some have suggested  it could worsen the severity of these negative effects on our financial position and operating results 
our operations  and the operations of our customers  are subject to numerous government regulations  which could adversely limit our operating flexibility 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies  and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are also subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes imposed by the united states government 
these restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes also prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
these laws have been changed frequently in the past  and there can be no assurance that future changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our customers operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
consequently  changes in governmental regulations applicable to our customers may reduce demand for our products and services 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
climate change regulations or legislation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas our clients intend to produce 
more stringent regulations and laws relating to climate change and greenhouse gases ghgs may be adopted in the future and could reduce the demand for our products and services 
in december  the us environmental protection agency the epa officially concluded that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide  methane and certain other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and welfare because such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
consistent with its findings  the epa has proposed or adopted various regulations under the clean air act to 
table of contents address ghgs 
among other things  the epa is limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from new cars and light duty trucks beginning with the model year 
in addition  the epa has adopted requirements for certain industrial plants and other stationary sources that emit large quantities of ghgs to obtain construction and operating permits 
the epa also has published final rules requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large sources and suppliers in the united states on an annual basis  beginning in for emissions occurring after january  in a november final rule  the epa extended those reporting requirements to include onshore oil and natural gas production  and natural gas processing  transmission  storage and distribution facilities 
the information collected under these reporting requirements could become the basis for future ghg regulations 
the us congress  moreover  from time to time has considered a variety of new legislative proposals to reduce emissions of ghgs 
in addition  some proponents of ghg controls have advocated mandating a national clean energy standard 
in  president obama encouraged congress to adopt a goal of generating of us electricity from clean energy by with credits for renewable and nuclear power and partial credits for clean coal and efficient natural gas  the president also has proposed ending tax breaks for the oil industry 
because of the lack of any comprehensive federal legislative program expressly addressing ghgs  there currently is uncertainty as to how and when additional federal regulation of ghgs might take place and as to whether the epa should continue with its existing regulations in the absence of more specific congressional direction 
a number of states  individually and regionally  have implemented or are considering their own ghg regulatory programs 
these initiatives have included so called cap and trade programs  under which overall ghg emissions are limited and ghg emissions allowances are then allocated and sold  clean energy standards and other regulatory requirements 
new climate change and related clean energy regulatory initiatives could result in our customers incurring material compliance costs  eg  by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for ghgs resulting from their operations  or adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas that our customers produce 
the impact of such future programs cannot be predicted  but we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors 
increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the demand for our seismic acquisition services 
hydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water  sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and  to a lesser extent  oil production 
due to concerns that hydraulic fracturing may adversely affect drinking water supplies  the epa is undertaking a comprehensive research study to investigate any potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
the initial study results are expected to be available in late the epa also has indicated that it intends to regulate hydraulic fracturing utilizing diesel fuels under its underground injection control permitting program  announced plans to develop standards for discharges of hydraulic fracturing wastewaters  proposed air standards for certain hydraulic fracturing operations and initiated a process for collecting health information and other data about fracturing additives 
separately  the us department of the interior has announced plans to develop new rules for hydraulic fracturing on public lands that would address disclosure of chemicals used in the process  well bore integrity and handling of flowback water 
aside from these federal initiatives  several state and local governments have moved to require disclosure of fracturing fluid components or otherwise to regulate their use more closely 
in certain areas of the country  new drilling permits for hydraulic fracturing have been put on hold pending development of additional standards 
adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays  increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on operators  which could reduce their production of natural gas and  in turn  adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the demand for our seismic data acquisition and processing services and products 

table of contents we have outsourcing arrangements with third parties to manufacture some of our products 
if these third party suppliers fail to deliver quality products or components at reasonable prices on a timely basis  we may alienate some of our customers and our revenues  profitability  and cash flow may decline 
additionally  current global economic conditions could have a negative impact on our suppliers  causing a disruption in our vendor supplies 
a disruption in vendor supplies may adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing processes require a high volume of quality components 
we have increased our use of contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacturing of products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables  our mems components  and various components of vectorseis ocean 
certain components used by us are currently provided by only one supplier 
if  in implementing any outsource initiative  we are unable to identify contract manufacturers willing to contract with us on competitive terms and to devote adequate resources to fulfill their obligations to us or if we do not properly manage these relationships  our existing customer relationships may suffer 
in addition  by undertaking these activities  we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control over quality and delivery schedules 
we also may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if our contract manufacturers fail to develop  implement  or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key components  increases in component costs and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if any of these risks are realized  our revenues  profitability  and cash flows may decline 
in addition  as we come to rely more heavily on contract manufacturers  we may have fewer personnel resources with expertise to manage problems that may arise from these third party arrangements 
additionally  our suppliers could be negatively impacted by current global economic conditions 
if certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies to us or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
under some of our outsourcing arrangements  our manufacturing outsourcers purchase agreed upon inventory levels to meet our forecasted demand 
our manufacturing plans and inventory levels are generally based on sales forecasts 
if demand proves to be less than we originally forecasted and we cancel our committed purchase orders  our outsourcers generally will have the right to require us to purchase inventory which they had purchased on our behalf 
should we be required to purchase inventory under these terms  we may be required to hold inventory that we may never utilize

item legal proceedings westerngeco in june  westerngeco llc westerngeco filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  houston division 
in the lawsuit  styled westerngeco llc v 
ion geophysical corporation  westerngeco alleges that we have infringed several united states patents regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices that are owned by westerngeco 
westerngeco is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction prohibiting us from making  using  selling  offering for sale or supplying any infringing products in the united states 
based on our review of the lawsuit filed by westerngeco and the westerngeco patents at issue  we believe that our products do not infringe the westerngeco patents  that the claims asserted against us by westerngeco are without merit and that the ultimate outcome of the claims against us will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we intend to defend the claims against us vigorously 
in june  we filed an answer and counterclaims against westerngeco  in which we deny that we have infringed westerngeco s patents and assert that the westerngeco patents are invalid or unenforceable 
we also asserted that westerngeco s q marine system  components and technology infringe upon a united states patent owned by us related to marine seismic streamer steering devices 
the claims by us also assert that westerngeco tortiously interfered with our relationship with our customers 
in addition  we claim that the lawsuit by westerngeco is an illegal attempt by westerngeco to control and restrict competition in the market for marine seismic surveys performed using laterally steerable streamers 
in our counterclaims  we are requesting various remedies and relief  including a declaration that the westerngeco patents are invalid or unenforceable  an injunction prohibiting westerngeco from making  using  selling  offering for sale or supplying any infringing products in the united states  a declaration that the westerngeco patents should be co owned by us  and an award of unspecified monetary damages 
in june  westerngeco filed a lawsuit against various subsidiaries and affiliates of fugro nv fugro  one of our seismic contractor customers  accusing fugro of infringing the same united states patents regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices by planning to use certain equipment purchased from us on a survey located outside of us territorial waters 
the court approved the consolidation of the fugro case with the case against us 
fugro filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit  and in march the presiding judge granted fugro s motion to dismiss in part  on the basis that the alleged activities of fugro would occur more than miles from the us coast and therefore are not actionable under us patent infringement law 
on february   the court granted westerngeco s motions for summary judgment related to our claims against westerngeco for infringement  inventorship and inequitable conduct 
fletcher in november  fletcher  the holder of shares of our outstanding series d preferred stock  filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our directors in the delaware court of chancery 
in the lawsuit  styled fletcher international  ltd 
v 
ion geophysical corporation  et al  fletcher alleged  among other things  that we violated fletcher s consent rights contained in the series d preferred stock certificates of designation  by ion s rl s execution and delivery of a convertible promissory note to the bank of china  new york branch  in connection with a bridge loan funded in october by bank of china  and that the directors violated their fiduciary duty to us by allowing ion s rl to issue the convertible note without fletcher s consent 
a total of million was advanced to ion s rl under the bridge loan  and ion s rl repaid million on the following day 
fletcher sought a court order requiring ion s rl to repay the million advanced to ion s rl under the bridge loan and unspecified monetary damages 
in march  the presiding judge in the case denied fletcher s request for the court order 
in a memorandum opinion issued in may in response to a motion for partial summary judgment  the judge dismissed all of fletcher s claims against our named directors but also concluded that  
table of contents because the bridge loan note issued by ion s rl was convertible into ion common stock  fletcher technically had the right to consent to the issuance of the note and that we violated fletcher s consent right by ion s rl issuing the note without fletcher s consent 
in december  the presiding judge in the case recused himself from the case and a new presiding judge was appointed to the case 
we believe that the remaining claims asserted by fletcher in the lawsuit are without merit 
we further believe that the monetary damages suffered by fletcher as a result of ion s rl issuing the bridge loan note without fletcher s consent are nonexistent or nominal  and that the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we intend to defend the remaining claims against us in this lawsuit vigorously 
sercel in january  the jury in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by us against seismic equipment provider sercel  inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas returned a verdict in our favor 
in the lawsuit  styled input output  inc et al v 
sercel  inc  cv  we alleged that sercel s  and searay digital seismic sensor units infringe our united states patent no 
 which is incorporated in our vectorseis sensor technology 
products of our company or inova geophysical that are compatible with the vectorseis technology include scorpion  aries ii  firefly  hawk and vectorseis ocean seismic acquisition systems 
the jury concluded that sercel infringed our patent and that our patent was valid  and the jury awarded us million in compensatory past damages 
in response to post verdict motions made by the parties  in september  the presiding judge issued a series of rulings that a granted our motion for a permanent injunction to be issued prohibiting the manufacture  use or sale of the infringing sercel products  b confirmed that our patent was valid  c confirmed that the jury s finding of infringement was supported by the evidence and d disallowed million of lost profits that were based on infringing products that were manufactured and delivered by sercel outside of the united states  but were offered for sale by sercel in the united states and involved underlying orders and payments received by sercel in the united states 
in addition  the judge concluded that the evidence supporting the jury s finding that we were entitled to be awarded million in lost profits associated with certain infringing pre verdict marine sales by sercel was too speculative and therefore disallowed that award of lost profits 
as a result of the judge s ruling  we are now entitled to be awarded an additional amount of damages equal to a reasonable royalty on the infringing pre verdict sercel marine sales 
after we learned that sercel continued to make sales of infringing products after the january jury verdict was rendered  we filed motions with the court to seek additional compensatory damages for the post verdict infringing sales and enhanced damages as a result of the willful nature of sercel s post verdict infringement 
in february  the court entered a final judgment and permanent injunction in the case 
the final judgment awarded us million in damages  plus interest  and the permanent injunction prohibits sercel and parties acting in concert with sercel from making  using  offering to sell  selling  or importing in the united states which includes territorial waters of the united states sercel s ul  xl and searay digital sensor units  and all other products that are only colorably different from those products 
the court ordered that the additional damages to be paid by sercel as a reasonable royalty on the infringing pre verdict sercel marine sales and the additional damages to be paid by sercel resulting from post verdict infringing sales would be determined in a separate future proceeding 
each of the parties appealed portions of the final judgment  and on february   the appellate court upheld the final judgment

 division a  we alleged that greatbatch had fraudulently misappropriated our product designs and other trade secrets related to the batteries and battery pack used in our digibird marine towed streamer vertical control device and used our confidential information to manufacture and market competing batteries and battery packs 
after a trial  on october  the jury concluded that greatbatch had committed fraud  violated the louisiana unfair trade practices act and breached a trust and nondisclosure agreement between us and greatbatch  and awarded us million in compensatory damages 
a judgment was entered consistent with the jury verdict 
in december  we and greatbatch settled the lawsuit

such lawsuits and claims could increase in number in the event our business continues to expand and we grow larger 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
any claims against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  cause us to incur costs and expenses  require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources

executive summary our business we are a leading provider of geophysical technology  services  and solutions for the global oil and gas industry  offering advanced acquisition equipment  software and planning and seismic processing services to the global energy industry 
our product and service offerings allow exploration and production e p company operators to obtain higher resolution images of the subsurface to reduce the risk of exploration and reservoir development  and to enable seismic contractors to acquire geophysical data more efficiently 
we serve customers in all major energy producing regions of the world from strategically located offices in cities on five continents 
in march  we contributed most of our land seismic equipment business to a joint venture we formed with bgp inc  china national petroleum corporation bgp  a wholly owned oilfield geophysical services subsidiary of china national petroleum corporation cnpc 
the resulting joint venture company  organized under the laws of the people s republic of china  is named inova geophysical equipment limited inova geophysical 
we believe that this joint venture will provide us the opportunity to further extend the geographic scope of our business through the sales and service facilities of bgp  especially in africa  the middle east  china and southeast asia 
our products and services include the following seismic data processing and reservoir imaging services  seismic data libraries  planning services for survey design and optimization  marine seismic data acquisition equipment  navigation  command control  and data management software products  and land seismic data acquisition equipment principally through our ownership in inova geophysical 
we operate our company through four business segments solutions  systems  software and our inova geophysical joint venture 
solutions advanced seismic data processing services for marine and land environments  reservoir solutions  onboard processing and quality control  seismic data libraries  and services by our geoventures services group 
systems towed streamer and redeployable ocean bottom cable seismic data acquisition systems and shipboard recorders  streamer positioning and control systems and energy sources such as air guns and air gun controllers and analog geophone sensors 
software software systems and related services for navigation and data management involving towed marine streamer and seabed operations 
inova geophysical cable based  cableless and radio controlled seismic data acquisition systems  digital sensors  vibroseis vehicles ie vibrator trucks and source controllers for detonator and energy sources business lines 

table of contents economic conditions demand for our seismic data acquisition products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness and ability to expend their capital for oil and natural gas exploration and development projects 
this demand is sensitive to current and expected future oil and natural gas prices 
during  west texas intermediate wti spot crude oil prices initially rose above per barrel  followed by declines to approximately per barrel near the end of the third quarter  during the fourth quarter of  wti spot crude oil prices rose again to end the year at around per barrel 
brent crude oil prices have remained above per barrel during most of ending the year at around per barrel 
during the middle of  there was notable price divergence between the brent and wti benchmarks  as brent oil prices were decoupled from the impact of excess oil inventories in the us and wti oil prices are decoupled from the political unrest in north africa and the middle east 
energy price forecasts are by their nature highly uncertain  but external reports indicate that oil prices are expected to remain resilient in as demand outpaces supply  particularly in developing countries in asia 
unlike the recovery in oil prices  us natural gas prices have remained depressed relative to levels  due to the excess supply of natural gas in the north american market 
this trend continued in early as natural gas prices dipped below per mmbtu 
however  demand for natural gas has not deteriorated and industry interest in natural gas and oil shale opportunities continues to increase  along with developments in the technologies employed to locate and extract shale reserves 
oil companies  seismic contractors and the e p companies that are users of our products  services and technology reduced their capital spending levels in and however  we saw increased levels of capital spending related to e p activity during the second half of  which continued into we expect that exploration and production expenditures will continue to recover to the extent e p companies and seismic contractors continue to see improved activity levels related to their business 
the land seismic equipment business  particularly inova geophysical s business in north america and russia  continues to experience softness  but is trending in the right direction 
according to external reports  global rig counts are at the highest levels in over two decades and are expected to grow over the next few years 
global e p spend continues to grow to record amounts 
for  our solutions segment experienced a slight decrease in revenues compared to  as decreases in data processing revenues and seismic data library sales could not be completely offset by improved strong multi client new venture revenues 
our footprint in us shale plays continues to expand with the completion of our first land multi client new venture project  and with several other projects underway 
in the process  we are increasing our technical understanding of shale plays and intend to leverage this expertise to broaden our shale footprint in both the us and international markets in although data library sales for did not reach s levels  customer demand remains high for our data libraries covering offshore areas around the globe in which e p companies have demonstrated a strong interest for exploration  including frontier basins off of east and west africa  brazil and in the arctic 
throughout  our solutions segment s data processing business was negatively impacted by the slowdown in gulf of mexico exploration and production activities resulting from the deepwater horizon incident in april however  our data processing revenues grew sequentially in each quarter of and we ended the year with record backlog  which included receiving the single largest data processing contract award in our history during the fourth quarter 
at december   our solutions segment backlog  which consists of commitments for i data processing work by gxt and ii multi client new venture projects by our geoventures group that have been underwritten  was million compared with million at december  we anticipate that the majority of this backlog will be recognized over the next months 
based on the sequential improvements by our data processing business and the growing demand represented by the data processing component of our solutions backlog  we expect our data processing business to return to its historical growth rates in our software segment revenues increased slightly for compared to  solely due to favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
in terms of the segment s functional currency british pounds sterling  software segment revenues remained consistent with due to steady subscription sales of orca software 

table of contents revenues for our systems segment increased significantly in compared to  with strong demand for our marine products supported by slightly higher sales of our sensor geophone products 
in addition  we recognized revenue from the twelve streamer system sale to bgp in the fourth quarter of our land seismic business  particularly inova geophysical s business in north america and russia  continues to show signs of recovery 
due to the recent launches of hawk and an improved firefly system  we continue to see sequential quarterly improvement and expect inova to be break even in although the us economic recovery has been slower than initially expected and global geopolitical tensions and regulatory uncertainties have adversely affected customers purchasing plans with respect to certain regions of the world  we believe that several conditions currently exist that favor increased seismic spending for the years ahead 
these conditions include the following demand for crude oil remains high and there is little spare production capacity at this time  particularly considering the geopolitical conditions in north africa and the middle east that have had the effect of placing a risk premium on crude oil prices  the natural decline in large oil reserves around the world has continued  and the pace of reinvestment into exploration and development will need to increase in order to minimize future rates of decline  remaining oil reserves are proving harder to find  and the potential for large undiscovered or underdeveloped reservoirs in offshore locations should continue to drive demand by e p companies and seismic contractors for improvements in marine equipment technology and offshore seismic data libraries  large e p companies are focusing on hydrocarbon reservoirs that are located in complex shale geological formations and more difficult to access regions of the world  which should increase demand for newer and more efficient imaging processing and equipment technology solutions  and while us natural gas prices may remain at depressed levels  investment in shale liquid markets should remain relatively strong in north america  and there is currently a high degree of interest in potentially productive shale areas in other parts of the world  in addition  companies will be under increasing pressure to find ways including new technologies to locate  find and produce shale gas on a more cost efficient basis 
we believe that technologies that add a competitive advantage through improved imaging  cost reductions or improvements in well productivity will continue to be valued in our marketplace 
we believe that our newest technologies such as digifin  digistreamer  orca and inova geophysical s recently announced technologies including firefly dr  hawk sn  univib  vectorseis ml and upgrading its aries ii product with digital sensor capabilities  will continue to attract customer interest  because those technologies are designed to deliver improvements in image quality within more productive delivery systems 
we are seeing increasing levels of demand for seismic services  and expect that will be a year of growth across all business segments for us 
however  in stating these expectations  we are assuming that i the global economy will not slip back into a recession  ii the price of crude oil will remain above per barrel  iii there will be an increase in the level of exploration and production activities in the us gulf of mexico and iv there will be increasing demand for seismic services in the middle east and north africa provided the geopolitical instability does not deteriorate further

table of contents we intend that the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations will provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our results of operations have been materially affected by the disposition of our land seismic equipment businesses to inova geophysical in connection with its formation in march  which affects the comparability of certain of the financial information contained in this form k 
in order to assist with the comparability to our historical results of operations  certain of the financial tables and discussion below exclude the results of operations of our disposed legacy land equipment segment which we refer to below as our legacy land systems segment 
the revenues  costs and expenses shown below that are identified as adjusted reflect the exclusion of the revenues  costs and expenses of our disposed land equipment segment s business

our purchase obligations primarily relate to our committed inventory purchase orders for which deliveries are scheduled to be made in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make choices between acceptable methods of accounting and to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risk and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we believe that all of the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements were reasonable at the time we made them  but circumstances may change requiring us to revise our estimates in ways that could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition 
management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to the estimates in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of i seismic data acquisition systems and other seismic equipment within our systems segment  ii multi client surveys  licenses of off the shelf data libraries and imaging services  within our solutions segment  and iii navigation  survey and quality control software systems within our software segment 

table of contents acquisition systems and other seismic equipment for the sales of seismic data acquisition systems and other seismic equipment  we follow the requirements of asc revenue recognition and recognize revenue when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the acquisition system or other seismic equipment is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the case in which a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained multi client surveys  data libraries and imaging services revenues from multi client surveys are recognized as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
under this method  we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers acquired or days processed 
upon completion of a multi client seismic survey  the survey data is considered on the shelf  and licenses to the survey data are sold to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the license of a completed multi client survey is represented by the license of one standard set of data 
revenues on licenses of completed multi client data surveys are recognized when a a signed final master geophysical data license agreement and accompanying supplemental license agreement are returned by the customer  b the purchase price for the license is fixed or determinable  c delivery or performance has occurred  and d no significant uncertainty exists as to the customer s obligation  willingness or ability to pay 
in limited situations  we have provided the customer with a right to exchange seismic data for another specific seismic data set 
in these limited situations  we recognize revenue at the earlier of the customer exercising its exchange right or the expiration of the customer s exchange right 
revenues from all imaging and other services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contract services performed on a day rate basis are recognized as the service is performed 
software for the sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems  we follow the requirements for these transactions of asc software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of these software systems when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the software is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case in which a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements generally include us providing related services  such as training courses  engineering services and annual software maintenance 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the element or  if vsoe is not available for the delivered element  we apply the residual method 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we offer certain time based software licenses 
for time based licenses  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term  which is generally two to five years 
multiple element arrangements when separate elements such as an acquisition system  other seismic equipment and or imaging services are contained in a single sales arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we follow the requirements of asc accounting for multiple element revenue arrangement asc 
the multiple element arrangements guidance codified in asc was modified as a result of the final consensus reached in accounting standards update asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we adopted this new guidance as of january  accordingly  we applied this guidance to transactions initiated or materially modified on or after january  the new guidance does not apply to software sales accounted for under asc there was no material impact as a result of adopting this guidance to our results of operations for this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable qualifying as a separate unit of accounting in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vsoe  if it exists  and otherwise third party evidence tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists 
table of contents for a unit of accounting  we use estimated selling price esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
vsoe is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar product is sold on a standalone basis 
if a product is seldom sold on a standalone basis  it is unlikely that we can determine vsoe for the product 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product were sold by us on a standalone basis 
our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we consider the anticipated margin on the particular deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar products and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
we believe this guidance principally impacts our systems division in which a typical arrangement might involve the sale of various products of our acquisition systems and other seismic equipment 
products under these arrangements are often delivered to the customer within the same period  but in certain situations  depending upon product availability and the customer s delivery requirements  the products could be delivered to the customer at different times 
in these situations  we consider our products to be separate units of accounting provided the delivered product has value to the customer on a standalone basis 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 
in july  we contracted with bgp for the sale of a twelve streamer digistreamer system 
bgp deployed the system into its commercial operations during the fourth quarter of the contract included customer specified acceptance criteria  which we met and bgp accepted in the fourth quarter of the contract contained multiple deliverables  of which the streamer system  related system components and certain services were delivered or performed in  and additional streamers and certain services are expected to be delivered or performed during we determined that the deliverables in this transaction had value to bgp on a standalone basis and allocated the arrangement consideration to each separate deliverable based on its relative selling price using esp 
in the fourth quarter of  we had recognized the majority of revenues related to this sale 
see further discussion of related party revenues at certain relationships and related party transactions 
in addition  pursuant to the transitional requirements of the new multiple element revenue guidance  we adopted the guidance codified by asu  certain arrangements that include software elements  as of january  this guidance amended the accounting model for revenue arrangements that includes both tangible products and software elements  such that tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue guidance 
there was not a material impact to our financial statements of adopting this guidance 
multi client data library our multi client data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for licensing to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the capitalized costs include the costs paid to third parties for the acquisition of data and related activities associated with the data creation activity and direct internal processing costs  such as salaries  benefits  computer related expenses  and other costs incurred for seismic data project design and management 
for  and  we capitalized  as part of our multi client data library  million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal processing costs 
our method of amortizing the costs of an in process multi client data library the period during which the seismic data is being acquired and or processed is the percentage of actual revenue recognized to the total estimated revenue or ultimate revenue multiplied by the total cost of the project the sales forecast method 
once a multi client data library is complete  the survey data is considered on the shelf and our method of amortization is then the greater of i the sales forecast method or ii the straight line basis over a four year period 
the sales forecast method is our primary method of calculating amortization 
we have determined the amortization period of four years based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and processing phases and during four years subsequent to survey completion 

table of contents estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our customers  our experience  and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenue 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales mix of surveys generating revenue in the period was held constant in  an increase in in the sales forecasts of all surveys would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million 
we estimate the ultimate revenue expected to be derived from a particular seismic data survey over its estimated useful economic life to determine the costs to amortize  if greater than straight line amortization 
that estimate is made by us at the project s initiation 
for a completed multi client survey  we review the estimate quarterly 
if during any such review  we determine that the ultimate revenue for a survey is expected to be materially more or less than the original estimate of total revenue for such survey  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from such survey 
in addition  in connection with such reviews  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under asc accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  asc record an impairment charge with respect to such data 
there were no impairment charges during  and equity method investment we use the equity method of accounting for investments in entities in which we have an ownership interest between and and exercise significant influence 
under this method  an investment is carried at the acquisition cost  plus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition 
as provided by asc investments  we record our share of earnings or losses of inova geophysical on a one fiscal quarter lag basis 
thus  our share of inova geophysical s results for the period from october  through september  and from march  through september  are included in our financial results for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments  including future demand for our inventory and the timing of market acceptance of our new products 
should these assumptions and judgments not be realized for reasons such as delayed market acceptance of our new products  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is allocated to our reporting units  which is either the operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by asc intangibles goodwill and other asc  we established the following reporting units marine systems  sensor geophone  software  and solutions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted future returns valuation method 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  our impairment test results could differ 
in accordance with asc  we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not impairment has occurred 
we formally evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment as of december for each of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit of an entity that includes goodwill is determined to be more than the fair value of the reporting unit  there exists the possibility of impairment of goodwill 
an impairment loss of goodwill is measured in two steps by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to net assets and liabilities including recorded and unrecorded other intangible assets to determine the implied carrying value of goodwill 
the next step is to measure the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied carrying value of goodwill  and  if the implied carrying value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 

table of contents we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and noting no impairments 
our goodwill as of december  was comprised of million in our marine systems  million in our software and million in our solutions reporting units 
the goodwill in our solutions reporting unit related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in a data processing business that occurred in december our and annual impairment tests both indicated that the fair value of our marine systems and software reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
our analyses are based upon our internal operating forecasts  which include assumptions about market and economic conditions 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
if the operational results of our segments are lower than forecasted or the economic conditions are worse than expected  then the fair value of our segments will be adversely affected 
our intangible assets other than goodwill relate to proprietary technology  patents  customer relationships and trade names that are amortized over the estimated periods of benefit ranging from to years 
following the guidance of asc  we review the carrying values of these intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not their carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value 
for  we determined that certain of the intangible assets customer relationships and proprietary technology associated with our aram acquisition now part of inova geophysical were impaired and recorded impairment charges of million 
similar to our treatment of goodwill  in making these assessments  we rely on a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the recognition provisions of asc share based payment asc 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to our employees outstanding stock based awards 
the total expense in was comprised of million reflected in cost of sales  million in research  development and engineering expense  million in marketing and sales expense  and million in general and administrative expense 
in addition to the stock based compensation expense related to the company s plans  we recorded less than million of stock based compensation expense in related to employee stock appreciation rights 
pursuant to asc  the stock appreciation rights are considered liability awards and  as such  these amounts are accrued in the liability section of the balance sheet 
the accompanying financial statements for include approximately million of stock based compensation expense related to  and asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the prior period stock based compensation expense relates to adjustments between estimated and actual forfeitures  which should have been recognized over the vesting period of such awards 
such amounts were not deemed material with respect to either the results of prior years or the results and the trend of earnings for and were therefore recorded in recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents credit and sales risks no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for  and  however  our top five customers in the aggregate represented approximately  and  respectively of our consolidated net revenues 
the loss of any significant customers or deterioration in our relationship with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for  we recognized million of sales to customers in europe  million of sales to customers in asia pacific  million of sales to customers in the middle east  million of sales to customers in latin american countries  million of sales to customers in the commonwealth of independent states  or former soviet union cis and million of sales to customers in africa 
the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
for  and  international sales comprised  and  respectively  of total net revenues 
for a number of years  the cis and certain latin american countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
however  given the global downturn that commenced in  more countries and areas of the world have also experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
in addition  the geopolitical turmoil that affected many countries in the middle east and north africa during has resulted in economic downturns in many of these countries 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world or the collectability of our existing receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
certain relationships and related party transactions for  and  we recorded revenues from bgp for purchases of products and services of million  million and million  respectively 
a majority of the revenues from bgp for related to the sale of a twelve streamer digistreamer system 
trade receivables due from bgp were million approximately million of this receivable was collected in january and million at december  and  respectively 
bgp owned purchased in march approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  we are a party to a support and transition agreement to provide inova geophysical with certain administrative services  including tax  legal  information technology  treasury  human resources  bookkeeping  facilities and marketing services 
the terms of the arrangement provide for inova geophysical to pay us approximately million per month beginning in april for services and to reimburse us for third party and lease costs we have incurred directly related to the support of inova geophysical 
the term of the agreement is for two years and will automatically renew for one year periods  unless either party provides notice of its intent to terminate the agreement 
at december   inova geophysical owed us approximately million that we reflected in the balance of accounts receivable  net 
the majority of these shared services we provide are reflected as reductions to general and administrative expense 
inova geophysical has provided notice of its intent to terminate the agreement and services are expected to end by june  james m 
lapeyre  jr 
is the lead independent director on our board of directors and the former chairman of our board of directors 
he is also the chairman and a significant equity owner of laitram  llc laitram  and he has served as president of laitram and its predecessors since laitram is a privately owned  new orleans based manufacturer of food processing equipment and modular conveyor belts 
mr 
lapeyre and laitram together owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  we acquired digicourse  inc  our marine positioning products business  from laitram in in connection with that acquisition  we entered into a continued services agreement with laitram under which laitram agreed to provide us certain bookkeeping  software  manufacturing  and maintenance services 
manufacturing services consist primarily of machining of parts for our marine positioning systems 
the term of this agreement expired in september but we continue to operate under its terms 
in addition  from time to time  when we have requested  the legal staff of laitram has advised us on certain intellectual property matters with regard to our marine positioning systems 
under an amended lease of commercial property dated february   between lapeyre properties  llc an affiliate of laitram and ion  we have leased certain office and warehouse space from lapeyre properties through january  with the right to terminate the lease 
table of contents sooner upon months notice 
during  we paid laitram and its affiliates a total of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million for manufacturing services  million for rent and other pass through third party facilities charges  and million for reimbursement for costs related to providing administrative and other back office support services in connection with our louisiana marine operations 
for the and fiscal years  we paid laitram and its affiliates a total of approximately million and million  respectively  for these services 
in the opinion of our management  the terms of these services are fair and reasonable and as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties at the time of their performance 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers  suppliers  and other parties under which we may agree to indemnify the other party to such arrangement from certain losses it incurs relating to our products or services or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract 
some of these indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss limitations 
historically  payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  including capital lease obligations 
of that indebtedness  approximately million accrues interest under rates that fluctuate based upon market rates plus an applicable margin 
as of december   the million in term loan indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility accrued interest at a libor based interest rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  with respect to the libor based rates for the term loan indebtedness was per annum 
each basis point increase in the interest rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid by approximately million 
as our outstanding term loan facility and any borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates  we are subject to interest rate risk 
we are therefore vulnerable to changes in three month libor interest rates 
we use a derivative financial instrument interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to the floating rate of our term loan facility 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we have entered into two interest rate cap agreements for our term loan facility with an initial notional amount of million and with a libor cap of 
at december   the three month libor rate applicable to us was thereby making the cap for the term loan facility out of the money 
subject to the cap  as of december   an increase in market rates of interest by would have increased our annual interest expense related to the term loan facility by million  and a decrease in market interest rates by would have decreased our annual interest expense related to the term loan facility by million 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk our operations are conducted in various countries around the world  and we receive revenue from these operations in a number of different currencies with the most significant of our international operations using british pounds sterling 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency  or the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries  which is not necessarily the us dollar 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including united kingdom  china  canada  the netherlands  brazil  russia  the united arab emirates  egypt and other countries 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
