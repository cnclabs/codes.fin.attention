the economic environment remains challenging  and many economic indicators continue to point to a slow and uneven recovery 
this uncertain environment has reduced the demand for the company s services and the products the company distributes  particularly in the life insurance market 
s temporary estate tax laws have also had a continuing impact on the high net worth life insurance market by increasing the value of the estate that is exempt from federal estate tax and thereby decreasing the size of the target market 

table of contents results of operations the company earns revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients 
the company also incurs commissions and fees expense and compensation and non compensation expense in the course of earning revenue 
the company refers to revenue earned by the company s businesses less the operating expenses of its businesses and allocated shared expenses associated with shared corporate resources as income loss from operations 
the company s operating expenses include commissions and fees  compensation expense employees  fees to principals  non compensation expense  amortization of intangibles  depreciation  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  gain loss on sale of businesses  net  and change in estimated acquisition earn out payables

adjusted ebitda is defined as net income excluding income tax expense  interest income  interest expense  gain on early extinguishment of debt  other  net  amortization of intangibles  depreciation  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  gain loss on sale of businesses  the accelerated vesting of certain restricted stock units rsus  any change in estimated acquisition earn out payables recorded in accordance with purchase accounting that have been subsequently adjusted and recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and the expense related to management contract buyouts 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors because adjusted ebitda reflects the underlying performance and profitability of the company s business by excluding items that do not have a current cash impact and are therefore not representative of the company s current operating performance 
additionally  adjusted ebitda excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period 
the company uses adjusted ebitda as a measure of operating 
table of contents performance in an individual business line  segment  and consolidated basis  for planning purposes  including the preparation of budgets and forecasts  as the basis for allocating resources to enhance the performance of the company s businesses  to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies  as a factor in shaping the company s acquisition activity  and as a factor in determining compensation and incentives to employees 
the company believes that the use of adjusted ebitda provides an additional meaningful method of evaluating certain aspects of the company s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under gaap when used in addition to  and not in lieu of  gaap measures

revenue many factors affect the company s revenue and profitability  including economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory developments and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and generally beyond the company s control  the company s revenue and earnings will fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the company generates revenue primarily from the following sources corporate client group 
the ccg earns commissions on the sale of insurance policies and fees for the development  implementation and administration of corporate and executive benefits programs  and property and casualty products and services 
in the corporate benefits business line  commissions and 
table of contents fees are generally paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintains its broker of record relationship with nfp s business 
commissions are based on a percentage of insurance premium or are based on a fee per plan participant 
in some cases  such as for the administration of retirement focused products like k plans  fees earned are based on the value of assets under administration or advisement 
generally  in the executive benefits business line  consulting fees are earned relative to the completion of specific client engagements  administration fees are earned throughout the year on policies  and commissions are earned as a calculated percentage of the premium in the year that the policy is originated and during subsequent renewal years  as applicable 
through the property and casualty business line  the ccg offers property and casualty insurance brokerage and consulting services for which it earns commissions and fees 
these fees are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintains its broker of record relationship with nfp s business 
individual client group 
commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
in the marketing organization and wholesale life brokerage business line  the icg generally receives commissions paid by the insurance carrier for facilitating the placement of the product 
wholesale life brokerage revenue also includes amounts received by nfp s life brokerage entities  including its life settlements brokerage entities which assist advisors with the placement and sale of life insurance 
in the retail life business line  commissions are generally calculated as a percentage of premiums  generally paid in the first year 
the icg receives renewal commissions for a period following the first year 
the icg s wealth management business line earns fees for offering financial advisory and related services 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of assets under management and are paid quarterly 
in addition  the icg may earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products 
advisor services group 
the asg earns fees for providing the platform for financial advisors to offer financial advice and execute financial planning strategies 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
the asg may also earn fees for the development of a financial plan or annual fees for advising clients on asset allocation 
the asg also earns commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products 
such commission income and related expenses are recorded on a trade date basis 
transaction based fees  including incentive fees  are recognized when all contractual obligations have been satisfied 
most nfp owned businesses and members of nfp s marketing and wholesale organizations conduct securities or wealth management business through nfpsi 
some of the company s businesses also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support revenue from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  consistency and profitability of business generated by the company 
incentive and marketing support revenue is recognized at the earlier of notification of a payment or when payment is received  unless historical data or other information exists which enables management to reasonably estimate the amount earned during the period 
these forms of payments are earned both with respect to sales by the company s businesses and sales by nfp s third party affiliates 
the vast majority of the company s revenue is generated from its united states operations 
from  the year nfp began operations  until  the company earned approximately to of its revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of its revenue in the fourth quarter 
in  nfp earned of its revenue in the fourth quarter  whereas in and  nfp earned of its revenue in the fourth quarter 
this change resulted primarily from a weaker sales environment for life insurance products in the icg 
historically  life insurance sales had been concentrated in the fourth quarter as clients finalized their estate and tax planning decisions 
continued relative weakness in this market has meant a change in the revenue patterns for the business 
s temporary estate tax laws have also had a continuing impact on the high net worth life insurance market by increasing the value of the estate that is exempt from federal estate tax and thereby decreasing the size of the target market 

table of contents operating expenses with respect to its operating results  nfp provides the following ratios in the discussion that follows i commission expense ratio  ii total compensation expense ratio and iii non compensation expense ratio 
the commission expense ratio is derived by dividing commissions and fees expense by revenue 
the total compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of compensation expense employees and fees to principals by revenue 
the non compensation expense ratio is derived by dividing non compensation expense by revenue 
included within the ccg  icg  and asg s revenue are amounts recorded to eliminate intercompany revenue between the company s business lines 
commissions and fees 
commissions and fees are typically paid to third party producers who are affiliated with the company s businesses 
commissions and fees are also paid to producers who utilize the services of one or more of the company s life brokerage entities  including the company s life settlements brokerage entities 
additionally  commissions and fees are paid to producers who provide referrals and specific product expertise 
when earnings are generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the business through fees to principals 
however  when income is generated by a third party producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense 
rather than collecting the full commission and remitting a portion to a third party producer  a business may include the third party producer on the policy application submitted to a carrier 
the carrier will  in these instances  directly pay each named producer their respective share of the commissions and fees earned 
when this occurs  the business will record only the commissions and fees it receives directly as revenue and have no commission expense 
as a result  the business will have lower revenue and commission expense and a higher income from operations as a percentage of revenue 
dollars generated from income from operations will be the same 
the transactions in which a business is listed as the sole producer and pays commissions to a third party producer  compared with transactions in which the carrier pays each producer directly  will cause nfp s income from operations as a percentage of revenue to fluctuate without affecting income from operations 
in addition  within the asg  nfpsi pays commissions to the company s affiliated third party distributors who transact business through nfpsi 
wholly owned businesses that utilize the company s marketing organization  wholesale life brokerage businesses and nfpsi receive commissions and fees that are eliminated in consolidation  having no effect on the company s net income 
compensation expense employees 
the company s businesses incur operating expenses related to compensating producing and non producing staff 
in addition  nfp allocates compensation expense employees associated with corporate shared services to nfp s three reportable segments largely based on performance of the segments and other reasonable assumptions and estimates as it relates to the corporate shared services support of the operating segments 
compensation expense employees includes both cash and stock based compensation 
nfp records share based payments related to employees and activities as well as allocated amounts from its corporate shared services to compensation expense employees as a component of compensation expense employees 
fees to principals 
nfp pays fees to principals to the principals and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the business they manage 
from a cash perspective nfp may advance monthly fees to principals that have not yet been earned due to the seasonality of the earnings of certain subsidiaries  particularly in the life insurance businesses in the icg 
nfp typically pays a portion of the fees to principals monthly in advance 
once nfp receives its cumulative preferred earnings  or base earnings  the principals and or entity the principals own will earn fees to principals equal to earnings above base earnings up to target earnings 
additional fees to principals are paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  nfp receives of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principals and or the entities they own receives 
as the company moves towards a more integrated business model  where the former owners of the acquired business become employees instead of principals  such ratios of base to target earnings will be proportionately impacted and become less meaningful 

table of contents fees to principals also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under the pip and the rtip 
for a more detailed discussion of nfp s incentive plans  see note commitments and contingencies incentive plans to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the company accounts for stock based awards to principals as part of fees to principals expense in the consolidated statements of operations as liability awards 
liability classified stock based compensation is adjusted each reporting period to account for subsequent changes in the fair value of nfp s common stock 
fees to principals may be offset by amounts paid by the principals and or certain entities they own under the terms of the management contract for capital expenditures  including sub acquisitions  in excess of  these amounts may be paid in full or over a mutually agreeable period of time and are recorded as a deferred reduction in fees to principals 
amounts recorded in deferred reduction in fees to principals are amortized as a reduction in fees to principals expense generally over the useful life of the asset 
since the asg is primarily comprised of nfpsi  nfp s registered broker dealer and investment advisor  no fees to principals are paid in this segment 
non compensation expense 
the company s businesses incur operating expenses related to occupancy  professional fees  insurance  promotional  travel and entertainment  telecommunication  technology  legal  internal audit  certain compliance costs and other general expenses 
in addition  nfp allocates non compensation expense associated with nfp s corporate shared services to nfp s three reportable segments largely based on performance of the segments and other reasonable assumptions and estimates as it relates to the corporate shared services support of the operating segments 
amortization of intangibles 
the company incurs amortization expense related to the amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation 
the company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets  such as investments in technology  office furniture and equipment  as well as amortization for its leasehold improvements 
depreciation expense related to the company s businesses as well as allocated amounts related to corporate shared services are recorded within this line item 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the company evaluates its amortizing long lived assets and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment in accordance with gaap 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
gain loss on sale of businesses 
from time to time  nfp has disposed of businesses or certain assets of businesses 
in these dispositions  nfp may realize a gain or loss on such sale 
change in estimated acquisition earn out payables 
the recorded purchase price for all acquisitions consummated after january  includes an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn out provisions 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these estimated earn out obligations are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in each reporting period 
incentive plans as of december   nfp maintained two incentive plans for principals and certain employees of its businesses  the pip and the rtip  each of which is discussed below 
certain employees participate in employee specific bonus programs that are earned on specified growth thresholds 

table of contents under the eip  during the fourth quarter of nfp issued equity awards to principals and certain employees of its businesses generally based on each business s performance over the two year period that ended on september  the initial eip performance period 
the payments made under the eip for the initial eip performance period were in the form of rsus 
the rsus became fully vested on september  with a fair market value based on the closing price of nfp s common stock on the same day of 
the restricted shares were primarily subject to liquidity restrictions until november   which is the original vesting date of the rsus awarded under the eip 
this action resulted in a pre tax charge of million in the third quarter of as of december   no businesses have elected to continue to participate in nfp s ongoing incentive plan 
see note commitments and contingencies ongoing incentive plan to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the annual principal incentive plan the pip is designed to reward the annual performance of a business based on the business s earnings growth 
for the initial month performance period of october  through september   a cash incentive payment was made to the extent a business s earnings exceeded its pip performance target as defined below 
the pip was established such that the greater a business s earnings growth rate exceeded its pip performance target rate for the month performance period  the higher the percentage of the business s earnings growth the company would pay the principal under the pip 
nfp calculates and includes a pip accrual in fees to principals expense 
the company paid million  which was included within fees to principals expense relating to the initial month performance period in the fourth quarter of for this initial month performance period  the incentive target the pip performance target for each business participating in the pip was generally set at the lower of a such business s earnings for the months ended september  or b such business s incentive target under the ongoing incentive plan as of september  the initial month performance period used performance targets that rewarded principals for advancing certain corporate goals and initiatives related to the company s reorganization and also took the difficult economic environment during the initial month performance period into account 
nfp s executive management committee  in its sole discretion  was able to adjust any pip performance target as necessary to account for changed business circumstances  including  without limitation  sub acquisitions 
for the initial month performance period  nfp calculated the amount of a business s pip accrual in fees to principals expense based on the business s earnings growth rate above its pip performance target rate 
the pip performance target over the course of the initial month performance period was allocated on a straight line basis 
nfp calculated a business s pip accrual amount and earnings growth rate on a cumulative basis 
the amount of fees to principals expense or benefit the company took in a particular quarter for a business s pip accrual depended on the difference between the business s cumulative performance against the pip performance target and what was accrued on a plan to date basis for the period ended on the last day of that quarter and the business s cumulative performance for the period ended on the last day of the preceding quarter 
the amount of pip accrual in fees to principals expense therefore varied from quarter to quarter 
a pip was in place for the month performance period of october  through december  the second pip 
management migrated to an incentive program that rewards only incremental growth but still maintained potential for material incentive payments 
the second pip will be payable in cash beginning in the first quarter of and  similar to the initial pip  was based on specific performance criteria for each business 
incentive targets second pip performance targets were set based on the earnings of each business during the last pip incentive period  with the fourth quarter of counted twice 
the calculation of a business s second pip performance target is based on a month period and reflects the fact that the second pip will include two fourth quarter periods 
the month performance period was selected in order to align the plan with the calendar year 
nfp s executive management committee  in its sole discretion  may adjust any second pip performance target as necessary to account for changed business circumstances  including  without limitation  
table of contents sub acquisitions 
the second pip accrual in fees to principals expense is based on the business s earnings growth rate above its second pip performance target 
to measure growth  the target is allocated on a seasonally adjusted basis  using the seasonal earnings pattern by quarter for the past two years 
nfp calculates the business s second pip accrual amount and earnings growth rate on a cumulative basis 
overall  the company has accrued million within fees to principals expense relating to the second pip from october  through december   for payment in the first quarter of for the twelve months ended december   the company s accrual was million 
a new pip is in place for the month performance period of january  through december   the terms of which are materially consistent with the second pip 
it is envisioned that future plans will be months  consistent with calendar years 
the revised long term incentive plan during the quarter ended september   nfp introduced the rtip 
the rtip covers the three year period from january  through december  and is based on a modified calculation of applicable thresholds over this period 
nfp s executive management committee  in its sole discretion  may adjust the calculation of the rtip as necessary to account for changed business circumstances 
as of december   the company has not accrued any amounts within fees to principals expense relating to the rtip  since the company did not reach the applicable thresholds during the first plan year 
the company does not anticipate that amounts relating to the rtip will be accrued within fees to principals in remaining plan years  given the applicable thresholds in place 
however  to the extent target thresholds are achieved  plan participants may be eligible for cash payments in the first quarter of corporate client group the ccg accounted for  and of nfp s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively

table of contents year ended december  compared with the year ended december  summary income from operations 
income from operations increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  income from operations increased primarily due to an increase in revenue  driven by both newly acquired businesses and growth at existing businesses  an increase to the change in estimated acquisition earn out payables  as well as decreases in fees to principals  non compensation expense and impairments

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash 
nfp derives liquidity primarily from cash generated by the company s businesses and from financing activities 
the company has historically experienced its highest cash usage during the first quarter of each year as balances due to principals and or certain entities they own for earned fees to principals above target earnings in the prior calendar year are calculated and paid out  more acquisitions are completed and the company experiences the seasonal revenue and earnings decline at the beginning of the year 
in many prior years this has led to borrowings on nfp s applicable credit facility in the first quarter 
the borrowed amounts are then typically repaid as the year progresses  when operating cash flow typically increases as earnings increase 

table of contents however  this borrowing pattern did not occur in  because cash flow was sufficient to fund fees to principals to principals of firms that performed in excess of target earnings  and acquisitions occurred primarily in the third quarter 
in addition  the cash balance on hand at the beginning of the year was higher than it had been in the previous several years 
the borrowing pattern could change to the extent acquisitions or sub acquisitions increase  or as capital is deployed for other uses

critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance gaap 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company continuously evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and on assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of the company s assets and liabilities  which values are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
of its significant accounting policies see note summary of significant accounting policies to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report  the company believes that the following critical accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
business combinations and purchase price allocations the company has acquired significant intangible assets through business acquisitions 
these assets consist of book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships  non compete agreements  trade name  and the excess of purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired goodwill 
the determination of estimated useful lives and the allocation of the purchase price to the intangible assets requires significant judgment and affects the amount of future amortization and possible impairment charges 
all of the company s transactions have been accounted for using the purchase method  and their related net assets and results of operations were included in the company s consolidated financial statements commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
certain of the acquisitions have provisions for additional contingent consideration based upon the financial results achieved over a multi year period 
in connection with these acquisitions  the company records the estimated value of the net tangible assets purchased and the value of the identifiable intangible assets purchased  which typically consist of book of business  management contracts  and non compete agreements 
book of business the company refers to a book of business as the acquired firm s existing customer relationships that provide a significant source of income through recurring revenue over the course of the economic life of the relationships 
nfp assumes the useful life of a book of business to be typically years 
management contract the management contract secures the services of the principal s and encourages growth of the business through the terms of the agreement 
the compensation terms are generally such that the principals receive percent of the differential between base earnings and target earnings  as previously described under business acquisitions acquisition model management contract 
the management contracts generally include three year non compete agreements which become effective upon termination of the contract and therefore discourage the possibility of competition against nfp 
nfp views the value of the management contract as being based on the future expectation of the principals ability to replace the diminishing acquired book of business  such that base earnings is maintained on an ongoing basis 
nfp assumes the useful life of a management contract to be years  based on an assumed average service life of the principals 

table of contents non compete agreement in certain deals where a management contract structure is not in place  the non compete agreements included in the employment contracts of employees are measured and recorded as an intangible asset separate from goodwill 
the useful life of a non compete agreement is primarily a function of the contractual terms of the agreement 
non compete agreements are valued based on their duration and any unique features of particular agreements 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
in the case of nfp s businesses  goodwill is expected to represent the value associated with workforce  management expertise  the value of future cash flow generated beyond the useful lives of the existing books of businesses and the management contract 
if contingent consideration is recorded  such liability would be an offset to an increase in goodwill 
these intangibles primarily represent the present value of the underlying cash flows expected to be received over their estimated future renewal periods 
consequently  the valuation of book of business  management contracts  non compete agreements  and goodwill involves significant estimates and assumptions concerning matters such as cancellation frequency  expenses and discount rates and the stock volatility of nfp as well as other market participants in the insurance brokerage market 
any change in these assumptions could affect the carrying value of these intangibles 
intangibles related to book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships and non compete agreements are amortized over a year  year  year  and year period  respectively 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company establishes an internal financial plan for each of its business lines and measures the actual performance of its business lines against these financial plans 
events or changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to  when a business line experiences a significant deterioration in its operating cash flow compared to the financial plan or prior year performance  a change in the extent or manner in which the long lived asset is being used  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
indicators at the business line level  which is considered a reporting unit for this analysis  include  but are not limited to  a significant deterioration in its operating cash flow compared to the reportable segment s financial plan or prior year performance  loss of key personnel  a decrease in nfp s market capitalization below its book value  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
if one or more indicators of impairment exist  nfp performs an evaluation to identify potential impairments 
if an impairment is identified  nfp measures and records the amount of impairment loss 
a two step impairment test is performed on goodwill for reporting units that demonstrate indicators of impairment 
in the first step  nfp compares the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit 
nfp determines the fair value of its reporting units by blending two valuation approaches the income approach and a market value approach 
in order to determine the relative fair value of each of the reporting units the income approach is conducted first 
these relative values are then scaled to the estimated market value of nfp 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and nfp is not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
table of contents compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner that is consistent with the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
contingent consideration additional contingent consideration may be paid to the former owners of the business upon the satisfaction of certain compounded growth rate thresholds over the three year period generally following the closing of the acquisition  or over a shorter  negotiated period 
nfp has incorporated contingent consideration  or earn out  provisions into the structure of acquisitions since the beginning of for acquisitions effective prior to january   contingent consideration is considered to be additional purchase consideration and is accounted for as part of the purchase price of the company s acquired businesses when the outcome of the contingency is determined beyond a reasonable doubt 
for acquisitions completed after january   earn out payables are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and are included on that basis in the purchase price consideration at the time of the acquisition  with subsequent changes recorded in the consolidated statements of operations  based on current estimates 
the fair value of earn out payables are based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements 
the fair value of the earn out payables are allocated to goodwill 
in determining fair value  the acquired business s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and the volatility of market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth 
the expected future contingent consideration payments are estimated on the basis of the earn out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections 
the fair value of the company s earn out payables were valued using a monte carlo simulation  whereby future applicable earnings are simulated using a geometric brownian motion  over the term of the earn out period 
for each simulation path  the earn out payments are calculated and then discounted to the valuation date 
the value of the earn out is then estimated to be the arithmetic average of all paths
