this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors in this annual report on form k 
our company during the year ended december   our only sources of income were revenues from the velarde a operations following our business combination transaction with ecu  payments in settlement of an arbitration claim  royalty and interest income  and sales of non core properties 
we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december    and we expect to report increased revenues from the velarde a operations during as a result of increased production rates 
we were incorporated in delaware under the delaware general corporation law in march  and are the successor to apex silver for purposes of reporting under the us exchange act 
in january  apex silver and its wholly owned subsidiary  apex silver mines corporation  filed voluntary petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
references in this discussion and analysis to successor refer to golden minerals and its subsidiaries on or after the march  emergence from chapter reorganization proceedings under the us bankruptcy code 
references to predecessor refer to apex silver and its subsidiaries prior to march  highlights during the year ended december  we focused our efforts primarily on our business combination with ecu  improving the velarde a operations  advancing our el quevar project  and raising additional capital through a private placement of our common stock 
we have also continued to make progress in advancing our portfolio of exploration properties 
an overview of certain significant events is provided below on september   we completed a business combination with ecu the transaction 
with the completion of the transaction  we became a mining company with producing mines 
at closing  each ecu common share was exchanged for the right to receive of a share of golden minerals common stock and in cash  and ecu became a wholly owned subsidiary of golden minerals 
in connection with the transaction and as consideration for the arrangement  we issued  shares of common stock   replacement options   replacement warrants  and paid approximately cdn  in cash 
as part of the transaction with ecu  we assumed a term loan  payable to two investment funds managed by iig capital  llc with an outstanding balance of million  which required equal monthly principal payments of approximately million through december  and quarterly interest payments at the greater of or the one month london interbank offered rate plus 
we prepaid the term loan in full on december  the prepayment totaled approximately million  consisting of the remaining principal balance of million  an early prepayment fee of million  and accrued interest of million 
on october   private equity funds managed by the sentient group collectively  sentient  purchased in a private placement an aggregate  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  the closing price of the company s stock on the nyse amex on september   resulting in gross proceeds to us of million 
following the private placement  sentient held approximately of our outstanding common stock excluding restricted common stock held by our employees 
during we focused on defining the extent of the yaxtch deposit and conducting feasibility work at our controlled el quevar silver project  located in the salta province of argentina 
the yaxtch deposit is our primary target currently identified at the el quevar project 
to date  we completed approximately  meters of diamond drilling in drill holes 
of these holes  were drilled to test the main yaxtch zone for potential mineralization  with approximately of the holes intersecting significant silver mineralization 
in addition  we completed an underground decline in the central yaxtch deposit to further define the mineral model 
current modeling suggests that the east and central yaxtch deposit could be mined by open pit methods and that the west yaxtch  which makes up approximately of the deposit  could be mined by underground bulk mining methods 
results of operations in this form k we include the historical financial statements of the predecessor 
these financial statements have been updated to reclassify the activity of the predecessor s san crist bal mine and related subsidiaries to discontinued operations as the result of the sale of the san crist bal mine effective march  because of the significant differences between the business operations of the predecessor and successor companies  the historical operating performance of the predecessor does not compare to the operating results of the current company and may not be indicative of our future performance

liquidity and capital resources at december  our aggregate cash and short term investments totaled million  which were comprised entirely of cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and short term investment balance at december  is lower than the million in similar assets held at december  due primarily to expenditures during the year of approximately million on the el quevar project  million related to debt service including interest and the payoff of debt and sales advances from customers related to the ecu transaction  million on exploration  million on interim financing of ecu pending completion of the transaction to fund ongoing operating expenses  exploration and capital equipment at the velarde a operations and ecu corporate overhead and debt service  million on general and administrative activities  million on transaction costs related to the ecu transaction  and million on the velarde a operations following completion of the transaction

the repayment totaled approximately million  consisting of the remaining principal balance of million  an early prepayment fee of million  and accrued interest of million 
in accordance with our recent guidance  we expect to produce approximately  ounces of silver and  ounces of gold during from the velarde a operations 
assuming metals prices of per ounce of silver and  per ounce of gold we expect to generate revenue from the sale of metals net of costs of metals sold of approximately million during with our cash and investment balance at december  of million  million of revenue from the sale of metals net of cost of metals sold from the velarde a operations and approximately million from royalties and other income during  we plan to spend the following amounts during pursuant to our long term business strategy approximately million on capital and development costs related to the phased intermediate expansion project at the velarde a operations  including continued development of the san mateo drift and other mine development and capital expenditures intended to increase the capacity and productivity of mine operations and plant facilities associated with an increase in oxide and sulfide ore production to  tonnes per day by  approximately million at our el quevar project to fund the continuation of project evaluation costs  approximately million on other exploration activities and property holding costs related to our portfolio of exploration properties located in south america and mexico as we pursue strategies to monetize portions of the portfolio  approximately million on general and administrative costs and million on working capital and other 
based on these projections  and assuming no cash generated by monetization of the exploration properties  we would end the year with a cash and investment balance of approximately million 
assuming metals prices of per ounce of silver and  per ounce of gold we expect that revenue from the sale of metals net of cost of metals sold will be positive at the velarde a operations beginning mid year by the end of  pursuant to the velarde a intermediate mine expansion plan and with metals prices as noted previously  we expect revenue from the sale of metals net of cost of metals sold will be sufficient to offset ongoing corporate general and administrative costs and expenditures related to our exploration activities 
the actual amount that we spend through the end of may vary significantly from the amounts specified above and will depend on a number of factors  including metals prices  the results of continuing operations and the success of the phased intermediate expansion project at the velarde a operations and the results of our continued project assessment work at el quevar and our other exploration properties 
there can be no assurance the expenditures planned for the intermediate expansion of the velarde a operations will result in the anticipated increase in silver and gold production 
if production does not increase  or metals prices decline from the levels noted previously  we would be required to preserve our cash and investments by reducing project evaluation  exploration work  and general and administrative expenses  relying on the monetization of non core assets  or securing additional funding from debt or equity 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining sufficient funding from any of these actions or sources in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in  we plan to continue evaluating the expansion of the velarde a operations beyond the planned phased intermediate expansion and to continue the further advancement of the el quevar project 
if economic studies for either the velarde a operations expansion or el quevar projects are positive  significant additional funding would be required to complete development and plant construction associated with the projects 
to fund completely either project would require additional equity or debt from external sources or funding from monetization of non core assets 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in funding or obtaining funding in the future on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we were unable to obtain additional funding during or beyond  the potential further development of the velarde a operations or el quevar projects could be delayed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have changed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
discussed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
mineral reserves mineral reserve estimates involve subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions that may later prove to be inaccurate 
these estimates include engineering evaluations of assay values derived from samplings of drill holes and other openings 
additionally  changes in the market prices of metals may render certain mineral reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to mine 
further  availability of permits  changes in operating and capital costs  and other factors could materially and adversely affect mineral reserves 
we have not established proven or probable reserves at any of our operating or exploration properties 
mineral properties when and if we determine that a mineral property has proven and probable reserves  subsequent development costs are capitalized to mineral properties 
when mineral properties are developed and operations commence  capitalized costs are charged to operations using the units of production method over proven and probable reserves 
mineralized material as used in this annual report  although permissible under sec s guide  does not indicate reserves by sec standards 
the company cannot be certain that any part of the yaxtch deposit or the velarde a operations will ever be confirmed or converted into sec industry guide compliant reserves 
asset retirement obligations we record asset retirement obligations in accordance with asc  asset retirement and environmental obligations asc  which establishes a uniform methodology for accounting for estimated reclamation and abandonment costs 
according to asc  the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
an offsetting asset retirement cost is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the assets with which it is associated  and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
deferred taxes our deferred tax liability is primarily related to the ecu merger and was calculated by applying the mexico corporate income tax rate of to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the ecu merger also resulted in the recognition of a deferred tax asset related to certain net operating loss carry forwards available in mexico 
in accordance with asc  the company presents deferred tax assets net of its deferred tax liabilities on a tax jurisdictional basis on its consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill goodwill is all related to the ecu merger and is primarily the result of the requirement to record a deferred tax liability for the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at amounts that do not reflect fair value 
the goodwill is not deductable for income tax purposes 
business combinations we followed the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with asc business combinations asc related to the merger with ecu discussed above 
mineral properties and the asset retirement obligation are recorded at estimated fair market value based on valuations performed with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm and a minerals engineering company 
the asset valuations were derived in accordance with the guidance of asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures asc using a combination of income  market and cost approach models depending on the asset 
in applying the appropriate valuation model or models  the valuation consultants employed a variety of economic factors and market data  including discount rates  income tax rates  projections of future metals prices  and third party market surveys 
fresh start accounting due to our emergence from bankruptcy  effective march   we applied fresh start accounting in accordance with asc business combinations asc and asc reorganizations asc 
asc requires  among other things  the determination of the reorganization value of the successor upon emergence from bankruptcy 
reorganization value approximates the fair value of the entity  before considering liabilities  and approximates the amount a willing buyer would pay for the assets of the entity immediately after the restructuring 
the fair value of our assets was determined with the assistance of a third party valuation expert and a minerals engineering firm  which used available comparable market data and quotations  discounted cash flow analysis  and other methods in determining the appropriate asset fair values 
table of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands of operating leases el quevar and velarde a concession payments purchase option agreement payments the operating lease obligations are related primarily to our corporate headquarters office in golden  colorado  as well as other office leases associated with our exploration activities 
the current corporate headquarters office lease expires in october  leases for the other offices expire at various times not exceeding four years 
we make annual maintenance payments of approximately  to the mexico federal government to maintain the velarde a operations concessions and  to the argentine federal government to maintain the el quevar project concessions 
these payments include payments for both owned concessions and concessions under purchase option agreements 
in addition to the annual maintenance payments to the argentine and mexican federal governments  we make payments to the current concession owners for the properties under option agreements in order to retain title to the properties 
amounts shown only include the concessions held for the velarde a operations 
option payments associated with other concessions at the el quevar project are not included because the concessions do not involve areas that are vital to the project and the company has the right to terminate the payments and release the concessions at any time 
we cannot currently estimate the life of the velarde a operations or el quevar project 
this table assumes that no annual maintenance payments will be made more than five years after december  if we continue to operate the velarde a operations beyond five years  we expect that we would make annual maintenance payments of approximately  per year for the life of the velarde a mine 
if we continue to develop a mine at the el quevar project  we expect that we would make annual maintenance payments of approximately  per year for the life of the el quevar mine 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  at december  we have purchase orders outstanding in the amount of approximately million related to equipment purchases at our velarde a operations in mexico relating to payments remaining for mobile equipment that had been ordered at december  and will be delivered in from time to time we enter into lease option agreements related to exploration properties that are of interest to us 
these agreements typically contain escalating lease payments required to maintain our exploration rights to the property 
such agreements are not included in the above table because exploration success is historically low and we have the right to terminate the agreements at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest substantially all of our excess cash in us government and debt securities rated investment grade or better 
the rates received on such investments may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions 
based on the average cash  restricted cash  investments and restricted investment balances outstanding during the year ended december   a decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction in interest income for the period of approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk although most of our expenditures are in us dollars  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in other currencies 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations 
to reduce this risk  we maintain minimum cash balances in foreign currencies and complete most of our purchases in us dollars 
commodity price risk we are primarily engaged in the operation and further development of properties containing gold  silver  zinc  lead and other minerals 
as a result  decreases in the price of any of these metals have the potential to negatively impact our ability to establish reserves and develop and operate our properties
