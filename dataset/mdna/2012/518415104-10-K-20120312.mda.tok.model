item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on our restructuring plan 
operations we do not manufacture our own silicon products 
we maintain strategic relationships with large semiconductor foundries to source our finished silicon wafers 
this strategy allows us to focus our internal resources on product and market development  and eliminates the fixed cost of owning and operating semiconductor manufacturing facilities 
we are also able to take advantage of the ongoing advanced process technology development efforts of semiconductor foundries 
the company and fujitsu limited fujitsu have entered into agreements pursuant to which fujitsu manufactures most of our new products on its nanometer  nanometer and nanometer cmos process technologies  as well as on nanometer  nanometer and nanometer technologies with embedded flash memory that we have jointly developed with fujitsu 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
in addition  all of our assembly operations and most of our test operations are performed by outside suppliers 
we rely on a third party vendor to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party distributors 
during december  we adopted a restructuring plan under which we established an operations center and transferred a portion of our supply chain support activities from our headquarters in oregon to the new operations center in singapore in during fiscal  we adopted a restructuring plan under which we transferred most of our remaining supply chain support activities from our headquarters in oregon to a new operations center in the philippines 
we perform certain test operations and reliability and quality assurance processes internally 
we have achieved and maintained iso quality management systems certification and iso quality systems certification  and released a full line of pld products qualified to the aec q reliability standard 
wafer fabrication we source silicon wafers from our foundry partners  fujitsu semiconductor limited in japan  seiko epson corporation in japan  united microelectronics corporation in taiwan and globalfoundries in singapore  pursuant to agreements with each company and their respective affiliates 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition of siliconblue  we now have manufacturing capability with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
tsmc in taiwan for products on its nanometer and nanometer cmos lp process technologies 
we negotiate wafer volumes  prices and other terms with our foundry partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
assembly after wafer fabrication and initial testing  we ship wafers to independent subcontractors for assembly 
during assembly  wafers are separated into individual die and encapsulated in plastic packages 
presently  we have qualified assembly partners in indonesia  malaysia  taiwan  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
we negotiate assembly prices  volumes and other terms with our assembly partners and their respective affiliates on a periodic basis 
we currently offer an extensive list of standard products in lead pb free packaging 
our lead free products meet the european parliament directive entitled restrictions on the use of hazardous substances rohs 
a select and growing subset of our rohs compliant products are also offered with a halogen free material set 
testing we electrically test the die on each wafer prior to shipment for assembly 
following assembly  prior to customer shipment  each product undergoes final testing and quality assurance procedures 
wafer sort testing is performed by independent contractors in malaysia  japan  and singapore 
final testing is performed by independent contractors in indonesia  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  and south korea 
marketing  sales and customers we sell our products directly to end customers through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
we also employ a direct sales management and field applications engineering organization to support our end customers and indirect sales resources 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers in the communications  computing  consumer  industrial  automotive  medical and military end markets 
we have agreements with manufacturers representatives and two primary distributors  arrow electronics  inc  including nu horizon electronics corp  wholly owned subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc  and distributors of the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong 
we have also established foreign sales channels in over foreign countries through a network of over sales representatives and distributors 
the majority of our sales are made through distributors 
orders from our sell through distributors are initially recorded at published list prices  however  for a majority of our sales  the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
in addition  we allow returns from sell through distributors of unsold products under certain conditions 
for these reasons  we do not recognize revenue until products are resold by sell through distributors to an end customer 
at times  we protect our sell through distributors against reductions in published list prices 
we provide technical support to our end customers with engineering staff based at our headquarters  product development centers and selected field sales offices 
we maintain numerous domestic and international field sales offices in major metropolitan areas 
the composition of our revenue by geographical location of our direct and indirect customers was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  january  january  total total total united states china europe japan taiwan other asia other americas total foreign revenue total revenue both foreign and domestic sales are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of sales to japan  where sales to certain customers are denominated in yen 
revenue from distributors our largest customers are distributors and have historically made up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by arrow electronics  inc  which includes its wholly owned subsidiary  nu horizons electronics corp  accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by avnet  inc accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of products to asti holdings ltd 
accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no other individual customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  and on august   our global franchise agreement with avnet terminated  however  we mutually agreed to terms for the transition of inventory through december  we do not expect a significant disruption in our ability to service customers as a result of this change 
we continue to serve our end customers with a network that includes a global distributor  regional distributors  manufacturer s representatives  and our direct sales team 
during fiscal  we embarked on a program to restructure our distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result the majority of our revenue in fiscal and was from resale of our products by sell through distributors 
in connection with this program  we terminated our distribution agreement between the company and promaster technology corporation on july   between the company and dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics effective for various territories on february and february   respectively  and between the company and other distributors effective on various dates 
dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics are wholly owned subsidiaries of asti holdings ltd 
additionally  we converted in place distributors in the asia pacific region and europe from a sell in to a sell through model 
as a result  we estimate that revenue was lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal by approximately million compared to revenue had we not embarked on this program 
revenue related to resale of our products by sell through distributors makes up   and of total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
seasonality in most years  we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products 
sales of our products are often higher during our fiscal quarters two and three  but lower during our fiscal quarters one and four 
as the company pursues new opportunities in the consumer end market  we expect there will be more seasonal trends in product revenue 
however  on balance  general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry have a greater impact on our business and financial results than seasonal trends 
backlog we accept purchase orders for deliveries covering periods from one day up to approximately one year from the date on which the order is placed 
however  purchase orders  consistent with common industry practices  can generally be revised or canceled by many of our customers without penalty 
our backlog for sell through distributors is valued at list price  which in most cases is substantially higher than the prices ultimately recognized as revenue 
in addition  significant portions of our sales are ordered with relatively short lead times  often referred to as turns business 
considering these practices and our experience  we do not believe the total of customer purchase orders outstanding backlog provides meaningful information that can be consistently relied on to predict actual sales for future periods 
competition the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid rates of technological change  product obsolescence and price erosion 
our current and potential competitors include a broad range of semiconductor companies from emerging companies to large  established companies  many of which have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources than we do 
the principal competitive factors in the programmable logic market include silicon and software product features  price  technical support  sales  marketing and distribution strength 
the availability of competitive intellectual property cores is also critical 
in addition to product features such as density  performance  power consumption  re programmability  and reliability  competition occurs on the basis of price and market acceptance of specific products and technology 
we intend to continue to address these competitive factors by working to continually introduce product enhancements and new products and by reducing the manufacturing cost of our products 
we compete directly with altera corporation and xilinx  inc we also indirectly compete with other semiconductor companies that provide logic solutions that are not user programmable  or  that offer products based on alternative solutions such as asic  assp  microcontroller  analog and dsp technologies 
although to date we have not experienced direct competition from companies located outside the united states  such companies may become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
competition may also increase if other larger semiconductor companies seek to expand into our market 
any such increases in competition could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
intellectual property we seek to protect our products and technologies primarily through patents  trade secrecy measures  copyrights  mask work protection  trademark registrations  licensing restrictions  confidentiality agreements and other approaches designed to protect proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that others may not independently develop competitive technology not covered by our intellectual property rights or that measures we take to protect our technology will be effective 
patents we hold numerous domestic  european and asian patents and have patent applications pending in the united states  europe and asia 
our current patents will expire at various times between and there can be no assurance that pending patent applications or other applications that may be filed will result in issued patents  or that any issued patents will survive challenges to their validity 
although we believe that our patents have value  there can be no assurance that our patents  or any additional patents that may be issued in the future  will provide meaningful protection from competition 
we believe that our success will depend primarily upon the technical expertise  experience  creativity and the sales and marketing abilities of our personnel 
patent and other proprietary rights infringement claims are common in our industry 
there can be no assurance that  with respect to any claim made against us  that we would be able to successfully defend against the claim or that we could obtain a license that would allow us to use the proprietary rights on terms or under conditions that would not harm our business 
licenses and agreements advanced micro devices in  as part of our acquisition of vantis corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of advanced micro devices  inc amd  we entered into an agreement with amd pursuant to which we have cross licensed vantis patents with amd patents  having an effective filing date on or before june   related to programmable logic products 
this cross license was made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
additionally  as part of our acquisition of vantis  we acquired certain third party license rights held by vantis prior to the acquisition 
agere systems in  as part of our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc  we entered into an intellectual property agreement with agere and agere systems guardian corporation 
pursuant to this agreement  these agere companies assigned or licensed to us certain fpga and field programmable system chip patents  trademarks  software and other intellectual property rights and technology  and we licensed back rights in these same assets 
these cross licenses were made on a worldwide  non exclusive and royalty free basis 
altera in  we entered into a comprehensive  royalty free  non exclusive patent cross license agreement and a multi year patent peace agreement with altera 
siliconblue under a patent license agreement dated july   kilopass technology  inc granted to siliconblue a license to certain us patents and related foreign patents 
the license is an exclusive  fully paid  worldwide license but is limited to the use of the patented inventions in the field of stand alone programmable logic devices 
employees at december   we had full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled technical and management personnel 
no employee is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
we have never experienced a work stoppage and consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered before making an investment decision relating to our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
currently  fujitsu semiconductor limited fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
as a semiconductor company  we operate in a dynamic environment marked by rapid product obsolescence 
the programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution followed by a slow ramp process to volume production 
our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address the markets we serve 
we work closely with foundries in our development of products meeting these market demands  and rely on the foundry to timely produce high quality products 
we have entered into agreements with fujitsu pursuant to which fujitsu manufactures most of our new products on its nanometer  nanometer and nanometer technologies 
fujitsu is our sole source supplier of wafers for our newest fpga and pld products 
the success of certain of our next generation products is dependent on our ability to successfully partner with fujitsu or new foundry partners 
if for any reason fujitsu does not provide their facilities and support for our process technology development  we may have difficulty timely and effectively developing new products until we can find a replacement supplier 
similarly  if for any reason fujitsu discontinues manufacturing our new products eg stop production on certain process technologies we will have to switch to a new foundry 
we may be unsuccessful in establishing new foundry relationships for our next generation products  or may incur substantial cost and manufacturing delays until we form a new relationship  each of which could adversely affect our operating results 
in order to secure new or additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
additionally  a disruption of fujitsu s foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political or labor unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event  or any other reason  could disrupt our wafer supply and could adversely affect our operating results 
our future revenue is dependent on programmable logic solutions 
customer design in activity  and thus  future revenue growth is dependent on market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
future revenue is inherently uncertain and could impact our ability to manage production or our ability to forecast sales 
we face uncertainties relating to the potential impact of customer design in activity because it is unknown whether any particular customer design in will ultimately result in sales of significant volume 
after a specific customer design in is obtained  many factors can impact the timing and amount of sales that we ultimately realize 
changes in the competitive position of our technology  the customer s product competitiveness or product strategy  the financial position of the customer  and other factors can impact the timing and amount of sales ultimately realized from any specific customer design in 
we are presently shipping our latest generation fpga  pld and programmable mixed signal product families that are critical to our ability to grow our overall revenue 
we also plan to continue upgrading our customer design tool products and increase our offerings of intellectual property cores 
our future revenue growth is dependent on customer design in activity  market acceptance of our new silicon and software design tool products and the continued market acceptance of our current products 
the success of these products is dependent on a variety of specific technical factors including successful product definition  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of wafer manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance  product cost  the quality and reliability of the product  and ease of use 
if  due to these or other factors  our new silicon and software products do not achieve market acceptance  or our current products do not maintain market acceptance  we may not be able to manage production levels or accurately forecast the future revenue and operating results may be adversely affected 
we depend on distributors  primarily those that use the sell through distribution model  to generate a majority of our sales and complete order fulfillment 
the failure of our distributors to sell our products and otherwise perform as expected could materially reduce our future sales 
we depend on our distribution partners to sell our products to end customers  generate a majority of our sales  complete order fulfillment and stock our products 
our distributors also help us provide technical support and other value added services to end customers 
our sales could be adversely affected if our distribution partners do not continue to effectively sell our products and provide related services 
we expect that the majority of our revenue in fiscal will be reported resale by our sell through distributors 
our primary sell through distributors  arrow electronics  inc including nu horizons electronics corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of arrow electronics  inc usa  avnet  inc 
avnet  and weikeng international and industrial co 
ltd made up approximately  and of total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
we depend on the timeliness and accuracy of these resale reports from our distributors  late or inaccurate resale reports could have a detrimental effect on our ability to properly recognize revenue and our ability to predict future sales 
in addition  our distribution channels recently have experienced consolidation due to merger and acquisition activity in that business sector 
consolidation may result in our distributors allocating fewer resources to the distribution and sale of our products  which could adversely affect our financial results 
on december  our global franchise agreement with avnet terminated 
revenue from avnet made up approximately of our total revenue for both years ended december   and january  we intend to serve the avnet end customers through a network that includes a global distributor  regional distributors  manufacturer s representatives  and our direct sales team 
if our end customers experience disruption in the supply of our products  or if our distributors and representatives are unable to provide technical support and other value added services at least at historical levels  we may lose future sales and our financial results could be adversely affected 
at times  our sales are concentrated in a small number of distributors  which are in various international locations and of various financial strengths 
financial difficulties  inability to access capital markets  or other reasons may affect our distributors performance  which could materially harm our business and our operating results 
our success depends on our ability to rapidly develop and introduce new products 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the programmable logic market is characterized by rapid technology and product evolution on some of the most advanced technologies 
our success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products which compete effectively on the basis of price and performance and which address the markets we serve 
we continually design next generation products that enable us to offer our customers lower power  lower cost  and more innovative products to maintain our competitive position 
these new products typically are more technologically complex than their predecessors  and thus have increased potential for delays in their introduction 
the success of new product introductions is dependent upon several factors  including timely completion and introduction of new product designs  achievement of acceptable prices for wafer  package  assemble and test costs  yields and market acceptance 
our development of new products and our customers decisions to design them into their systems can take as long as three years  depending upon the complexity of the device and the application 
accordingly  new product development requires a long term forecast of market trends and customer needs  and the successful introduction of our products may be adversely affected by competing products or by technologies serving the markets addressed by our products 
if we experience delays in the introduction of new products  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  new product introductions frequently depend on our development and implementation of new process technologies  and our growth will depend in part upon the successful development and market acceptance of these process technologies 
our products require technically sophisticated sales and marketing personnel to market these products successfully to customers 
we are developing new products with lower power consumption  with smaller feature sizes  the fabrication of which will be substantially more complex than our current products 
if we are unable to design  develop  manufacture  market and sell new products successfully  our operating results will be harmed 
our new product development  process development or execution to design and bring to market products that offer lower power  lower cost with more innovation marketing and sales efforts may not be successful 
furthermore  our new products may not achieve market acceptance and price expectations for our new products may not be achieved which could significantly harm our business and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
we may be unable to assimilate and integrate the operations  personnel  technologies  products  and information systems of siliconblue technologies ltd  apac ic layout consultants  inc  or future acquisitions  which may harm our business  financial condition or operating results 
one element of our business strategy includes expansion through the acquisition of businesses  assets  products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings  expand our market coverage  increase our skilled engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities 
on december   we acquired siliconblue technologies ltd  a cayman islands exempted company siliconblue which put us in a unique position in the mobile consumer segment of the programmable logic market 
the purchase price  totaling million was paid in cash 
in addition  the company recorded goodwill of million in connection with the purchase of siliconblue 
the acquisition of siliconblue may result in revenue and gross margin fluctuations due to seasonality  increased operating expenses  inventory valuation volatility and a more competitive pricing environment 
on july   we completed the purchase of rise technology development limited rise  a hong kong company  and its subsidiary  apac ic layout consultants  inc apac ic  a manila  philippines based company engaged in engineering layout and design services  for approximately million  which includes all assets and liabilities of the entity 
this acquisition of rise and apac ic is part of our effort to improve our research and development and operations activities  reduce costs and streamline our supply chain for improved predictability and flexibility 
in addition  the company recorded goodwill of million in connection with the purchase of rise and apac ic 
acquisitions similar to siliconblue and apac  or future acquisitions typically entail many risks and we may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of the acquired companies or businesses 
we may experience delays in the timing and successful integration of an acquired company s technologies and product development as a result of volume production  unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or  contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
acquisitions typically require large one time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets  any of which items could negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition  we have or may record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future 
any of these charges could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash may reduce our cash reserves 
we may seek to obtain additional cash to fund an acquisition by selling equity or debt securities 
any issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to consummate any future acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from any of our historic or future acquisitions 
we may not be able to find suitable acquisition opportunities that are available at attractive valuations  if at all 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms  and any decline in the price of our common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate additional acquisitions 
we are required under us gaap to test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time that circumstances arise indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable 
at december   we had million of goodwill 
we completed our annual test of goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of and concluded that we did not have any impairment at that time 
there is no assurance that future impairment tests will indicate that goodwill will be deemed recoverable 
the success of any acquisition  including rise and apac ic and siliconblue  requires the integration of products  technologies  personnel and administrative resources  and could result in departures of key personnel  loss of key customers  distributors or vendors  equity dilution or acquisition of unknown liabilities 
furthermore  our ability to predict seasonality  end customer demand  and our customers end customer demand for siliconblue products is limited 
as a result  an acquisition similar to siliconblue and apac  or future acquisitions could disrupt our operations and may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
a downturn in the communications equipment end market could cause a reduction in demand for our products and limit our ability to maintain revenue levels and operating results 
historically the largest percentage of our revenue approximately of fiscal revenue has been derived from customers participating in the communications equipment end market 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company participated in the china g telecommunications network build out by selling products used by two large telecommunication equipment providers  which accounted for a combined of our aggregate revenue 
this is primarily due to strength in the wireless portion of the communications end market 
for the fiscal year  the same two large telecommunication equipment providers accounted for a combined of revenue 
in the past  a general weakening in demand for programmable logic products from customers in the communications end market has adversely affected our revenue 
in addition  telecommunication equipment providers are building networks for g networks in which we compete 
any deterioration in the communication end market  our ability to compete in future telecommunications solutions eg g networks or our end customers reduction in capital spending to support this end market could lead to a reduction in demand for our products which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the consumer end market is characterized by rapid product obsolescence and requires that we have the right products at the right time for our customers to fulfill demand for products in the consumer end market 
if we are unable to forecast demand for our products  or we don t have products to ship at the right time  our financial condition and results may be adversely affected 
our revenue from the consumer end market consists primarily of revenue from our products designed and used in a broad range of products including flat panel displays  dvd players and recorders  digital cameras and camcorders  gaming consoles  set top boxes  and smart handheld devices is characterized by rapidly changing market requirements and products 
our success in this market will depend principally on our ability to meet the market windows for consumer products  to predict technology and market trends  to develop products on a timely basis  avoid cancellations or delay of products  any of the foregoing problems could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
global economic conditions and uncertainty  as well as the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  could adversely affect our revenue  gross margin and expenses  collectability of accounts receivable  supplier relationships  and ability to access capital markets 
our revenue and gross margin can fluctuate significantly due to downturns in the general economy or the semiconductor industry 
these downturns are often severe and prolonged and can result in significant reductions in the demand for pld and fpga products in markets in which we compete 
global economic weakness or cyclical downturns have previously resulted from periods of economic recession  reduced access to credit markets  weakening or strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies  weak end user demand  excess industry capacity  political instability  government fiscal policy  sovereign debt  terrorist activity  military actions  or general reductions in inventory levels by customers  and may cause a decrease in revenue  gross margin  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables 
in addition  our relationships with our suppliers and our ability to access capital markets could be adversely affected 
in addition  customer financial difficulties have previously resulted and could in the future result in  increases in bad debt write offs and additions to reserves in our accounts receivable 
global economic and cyclical downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses 
uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
any or all of these factors could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
because of our international business and operations  we are vulnerable to the economic conditions and tax policies of various jurisdictions and other business risks associated with conducting operations outside of the us which could have a material adverse effect on our business and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to our us operations  we have significant international operations  including foreign sales offices to support our international customers and distributors  our operational centers in the philippines and singapore  and our research and development sites in china  india and the philippines 
in connection with the restructuring we announced in our international operations grew as we relocated certain operational  design  and administrative functions outside the us all of these activities are subject to the uncertainties associated with international business operations  including tax laws and regulations  trade barriers  economic sanctions  import and export regulations  duties and tariffs and other trade restrictions  changes in trade policies  foreign governmental regulations  potential vulnerability of and reduced protection for ip  longer receivable collection periods and disruptions or delays in production or shipments  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and or operating results 
moreover  our financial condition and results of operations could be affected in the event of political conflicts or economic crises in countries where our main wafer providers  end customers and contract manufacturers who provide assembly and test services worldwide  are located 
adverse change to the circumstances or conditions of our international business operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and many of our direct and indirect competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing and sales resources 
the current level of competition in the programmable logic market is high and may increase in the future 
we currently compete directly with companies that have licensed our technology or have developed similar products  including altera corporation  and xilinx  inc we also compete indirectly with numerous semiconductor companies that offer products based on alternative solutions such as asic  assp  microcontroller  analog  and digital signal processing dsp technologies 
these direct and indirect competitors are established  multinational semiconductor companies as well as emerging companies 
if we are unable to compete successfully in this environment  our future results will be adversely affected 
our revenue and gross margin are subject to fluctuations  including quarter over quarter  due to many factors  which make our future financial results difficult to predict 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate  including quarter over quarter fluctuations 
consequently  our operating results may fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors 
our revenue and gross margin may fluctuate due to product mix  seasonality  inventory fluctuations at our distributor end customers  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing dynamics  geographical and market segment pricing strategies  wafer  package and assembly prices and yields  overhead absorption  as well as provisions for warranty and excess and obsolete inventory 
we have limited ability to foresee changes or the pace of change in sales by product classification 
in the past we have also experienced periods of decline in sales of our mainstream and mature products 
if  in any period  sales of our mature and mainstream products decline and sales of new products do not increase at a rate that is sufficient to counteract this decline  then our total revenue would decline 
in addition  as mature products typically generate a higher gross margin than mainstream or new products  a faster than normal decline in sales of mature products could adversely impact our gross margins 
we also have experienced  and may experience in the future  gross margin declines in certain products or end markets  reflecting the effect of competitive pricing pressures  inventory write downs  charges associated with the cancellation of planned production lines  costs associated with our customers unplanned demand to build inventory  and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that  as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other factors  we are unable to pass on to our customers 
further  our ability to predict seasonality  end customer demand  our customers end customer demand  and resale of our products by our sell through distributors is limited 
typically  a significant amount of our revenue comes from turns orders  which are orders placed and filled within the same period 
by definition  turns orders are not captured in a backlog measurement at the beginning of a quarter 
accordingly  we cannot use backlog as a reliable measure for predicting revenue 
foreign sales  primarily in the asia pacific region  account for the majority of our revenue and may decline in the future due to economic and governmental uncertainties 
we derive the majority of our revenue from sales outside of the united states 
accordingly  if we experience a decline in foreign sales  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our foreign sales are subject to numerous risks  including changes in local economic conditions  exchange rate volatility  governmental stimulus packages  controls and trade restrictions  export license requirements and restrictions on the use of technology  political instability  war  terrorism or pandemic disease  changes in tax rates  tariffs or freight rates  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer receivable collection periods  natural or man made disasters in the countries where we sell our products  interruptions in transportation  different labor regulations  and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales offices 
product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue  gross margins and net income 
we generally warrant our products for varying lengths of time against non conformance to our specifications and certain other defects 
because our products  including hardware  software and intellectual property cores  are highly complex and increasingly incorporate advanced technology  our quality assurance programs may not detect all defects  whether manufacturing defects in individual products or systematic defects that could affect numerous shipments 
inability to detect a defect could result in increased engineering expenses necessary to remediate the defect and also result in increased costs due to inventory impairment charges 
on occasion we have also repaired or replaced certain components or made software fixes or refunded the purchase price or license fee paid by our customers due to product or software defects 
if there are material increases in product defects  the costs to remediate such defects  net of reimbursed amounts from our vendors  if any  or to resolve warranty claims compared with our historical experience  may adversely affect our revenue  gross margins and net income 
we may experience a disruption of our business activities related to the successful execution of the restructuring plan 
during  our board of directors adopted a restructuring plan the restructuring plan to more efficiently implement our product development strategy and to better align our corporate strategy with the our sales resources to reduce development and operational costs and to streamline our supply chain for improved predictability and flexibility 
part of the restructuring plan includes extending silicon development capabilities and planning and logistics activities by locating personnel in manila  philippines 
we expect this to initially increase certain supply chain and research and development costs until we complete the transition 
during the third quarter of  we incurred restructuring costs related to outsourcing certain non core it services 
we may experience disruption in our business activities as we execute our restructuring plan  and our relationships with employees  customers and suppliers could be adversely affected by these disruptions 
we expect to complete the restructuring plan by the first quarter of if we are unable to successfully complete our restructuring plan  our future results will be adversely affected 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our financial results and competitive position may suffer 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology 
we intend to continue to protect our proprietary technology through patents  copyrights and trade secrets 
despite this intention  we may not be successful in achieving adequate protection 
claims allowed on any of our patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
patents issued to us also may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
finally  our competitors may develop competing technologies 
if any of these events occur  our competitive position could be adversely affected 
companies in the semiconductor industry vigorously pursue and defend their intellectual property rights 
we may be forced to pursue legal action to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we become involved in protracted intellectual property disputes or litigation  we may be forced to use substantial financial and management resources  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
we face a number of patent infringement claims and may be subject to other intellectual property disputes  which could require us to spend a significant sum to defend and could cause losses 
our industry is characterized by increasingly frequent claims regarding patents and other intellectual property rights of others 
we have been  and from time to time expect to be  notified of claims that we are infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others 
for instance  we are exposed to certain asserted and unasserted potential claims  including the pending patent litigation brought against us by lizy k 
john  and intellectual ventures i llc and intellectual ventures ii llc as described in item legal proceedings  below 
if any third party makes a valid claim against us  we could face significant liability and could be required to make material changes to our products and processes 
in response to claims of infringement  we have incurred legal costs and committed management resources  and there can be no assurance that we would be successful in our defense against the claims 
any such litigation could result in a substantial diversion of management and financial resources  including legal costs incurred to defend claims  which by itself could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we may seek licenses under patents that we are alleged to be infringing  however  we may not be able to obtain a license on favorable terms  or at all  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
if our foundry partners and assembly and test contractors experience quality or yield problems  we may face a shortage of products available for sale and our revenue or gross margin could be adversely affected 
we depend on our foundry partners to deliver high quality silicon wafers with acceptable yields in a timely manner consistent with our safety stock inventory level and production plan 
in addition  we rely on assembly and test contractors to assemble and test our devices with acceptable quality and yield levels 
as is common in our industry  we have experienced wafer and device yield problems  quality or delivery delays in the past 
the reliable manufacture of silicon wafers and the assembly and test of high performance programmable logic devices are complicated and technically demanding process requiring a high degree of technical skill  state of the art equipment  the availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as chemicals  gases  polysilicon  silicon wafers  ultra pure metals  gold and copper  our ability to successfully replace gold with copper for assembled devices beginning in the second half of  the absence of defects in production wafers and assembly and packaging manufacturing  the elimination of minute impurities and errors in each step of the fabrication  assembly and test process  and effective cooperation between the foundry partners  and assembly and test contractors and us 
as a result  our foundry partners and or assembly and test contractors may periodically experience difficulties in achieving acceptable quality and yield levels in manufacturing  assembling and testing our products 
if we experience prolonged quality or yield problems in the future and we do not have adequate levels of safety stock inventory on hand  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our wafer supply  which is sourced entirely from the asia pacific region  could be interrupted or reduced or  could experience increased costs  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale or increased costs 
we do not internally manufacture finished silicon wafers and most of our products  including all of our newest products  are manufactured by a sole source 
currently  our silicon wafers are manufactured by fujitsu in japan  seiko epson corporation in japan  united microelectronics corporation in taiwan  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd 
in taiwan  and globalfoundries in singapore 
if any of our current or future foundry partners significantly interrupts or reduces our wafer supply  increases wafer costs  or if any of our relationships with our partner suppliers is terminated  our operating results could be adversely affected 
at present  we believe that our supply commitments are adequate 
however  these existing supply commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our supply commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining wafer deliveries consistent with the supply commitments 
we negotiate wafer prices and supply commitments from our suppliers on at least an annual basis 
if any of our foundry partners were to reduce its supply commitment or increase its wafer prices  and we cannot find alternative sources of wafer supply  our operating results could be adversely affected 
many other factors that could disrupt our wafer supply are beyond our control 
since worldwide manufacturing capacity for silicon wafers is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall wafer demand or interruptions in wafer supply  or periods of increased wafer prices 
during periods of economic uncertainty  our foundry partners may reduce or restructure their operations which may also affect the availability and price of wafers  and adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our foundry partners foundry operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our wafer supply and could adversely affect our operating results 
our supply of assembled and tested products  all from the asia pacific region  could be interrupted  could experience increased costs or could be reduced  which may result in a shortage of products available for sale or increased costs 
we do not assemble our finished products or perform all testing of our products 
our finished silicon wafers are assembled and tested by independent contractors located in indonesia  malaysia  the philippines  singapore and south korea 
economic  financial  social and political conditions in asia have historically been volatile 
financial difficulties  the effects of currency fluctuation  governmental actions or restrictions  prolonged work stoppages  political unrest  war  natural disaster  cost of converting to more copper content  cost of assembly materials such as gold and copper  disease or any other difficulties experienced by our suppliers may disrupt our supply and could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  certain provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act may soon require us to report on conflict materials used in our products and the due diligence plan we put in place to track whether such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
the implementation of these requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in certain of our products 
in the past  we have experienced delays in obtaining assembled and tested products and in securing assembly and test capacity commitments from our suppliers 
at present  we anticipate that our assembly and test capacity commitments are adequate  however  these existing commitments may not be sufficient for us to satisfy customer demand in future periods 
additionally  notwithstanding our assembly and test capacity commitments  we may still have difficulty in obtaining deliveries of finished products consistent with the capacity commitments 
we negotiate assembly and test prices and capacity commitments from our contractors on a periodic basis 
if any of our assembly or test contractors were to reduce its capacity commitment or increase its prices  and we cannot find alternative sources  our operating results could be adversely affected 
many other factors that could disrupt our supply of finished products are beyond our control 
because worldwide capacity for assembly and testing of semiconductor products is limited and inelastic  we could be harmed by significant industry wide increases in overall demand or interruptions in supply 
the assembly of complex packages requires a consistent supply of a variety of raw materials such as substrates  lead frames  gold  copper and mold compound 
a significant industry wide increase in demand  or interruptions in the supply of these materials to our assembly or test contractors  could adversely affect our operating results 
additionally  a future disruption of any of our assembly or test contractors operations as a result of a fire  earthquake  flooding  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our supply of assembled and tested devices and could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  our quarterly revenue levels may be affected to a significant extent by our ability to match inventory and current production mix with the product mix required to fulfill orders 
the large number of individual parts we sell and the large number of customers for our products  combined with limitations on our and our customers ability to forecast orders accurately and our relatively lengthy manufacturing cycles  may make it difficult to achieve a match of inventory on hand  production units  and shippable orders sufficient to realize quarterly or annual revenue projections 
we rely on information technology systems to manage our business 
failure of these systems to function properly or our failure to control unauthorized access to our systems may cause operating or reporting disruptions 
the failure of these systems to function properly could result in business disruption 
we rely in part on various information technology it systems to manage our operations  including financial reporting  and we regularly make changes to improve them as necessary 
consequently  we periodically implement new  or enhance existing  operational and it systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
these systems are also subject to power and telecommunication outages or other general system failures 
failure of our it systems or difficulties in managing them could result in business disruption 
while we have not yet experienced any significant disruptions to our business  we may encounter some unexpected aspects of the conversion  outsourcing  or new systems implementations that cause difficulty in the new reporting system which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and cash flows 
our legal organizational structure is complex  which could result in unanticipated unfavorable tax or other consequences including our ability to maintain or forecast a competitive corporate tax rate  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
on december   we began to implement a global tax structure to more effectively align our corporate structure and transaction flows with our geographic business operations including responsibility for sales and purchasing activities 
we have numerous sales offices in foreign locations  operational centers in the philippines and singapore  and research and development sites in china  india and the philippines 
revenues from foreign regions account for over of all revenue 
in addition  the large majority of our suppliers are located in the asia pacific region 
based on these factors we have created new and realigned existing legal entities  intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property  inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions  and implemented cost sharing and intellectual property licensing and royalty agreements between our us and low cost tax jurisdictions 
we currently operate legal entities in countries where we conduct manufacturing  design  and sales operations around the world 
in some countries  we maintain multiple entities for tax or other purposes 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and related interpretations in the countries in which we operate may impact the taxes we pay or tax provision we record  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we cannot give any assurance as to what taxes we pay or the ability to estimate our future effective tax rate because of  among other things  uncertainty regarding the tax policies of the jurisdictions where we operate 
as a result  our actual effective tax rate  or taxes paid may vary materially from our expectations 
changes in tax laws  regulations  and related interpretations in the countries in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
if our independent software and hardware developers and suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our contractual requirements  we may face a delay in the introduction of new products  a shortage of new or existing products  or a lack of support for new or existing products 
we rely on independent software and hardware developers for the design  development  supply and support of intellectual property cores  design and development software  and certain elements of evaluation boards 
as a result  failure or significant delay to complete software or hardware under contract to deliver could disrupt the release of or introduction of new or existing products  which might be detrimental to the capability of our new products to win designs 
any of these delays or inability to complete the design or development could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or operating results 
we depend upon a third party to provide inventory management  order fulfillment  and direct sales logistics 
we rely on a third party vendor located in singapore to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party distributors 
if our third party supply chain partner were to discontinue services for us or its operations are disrupted as a result of a fire  earthquake  act of terrorism  political unrest  governmental uncertainty  war  disease or other natural disaster or catastrophic event  our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely  cost effectively  or at all  would be hindered  which could adversely affect our business 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us 
we typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders 
we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities 
generally  our customers may cancel orders more than days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing 
our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when we sell indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
moreover  consumer end markets are characterized by short product lifecycles  which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
we may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize  could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins 
factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of the value of our inventory  a reduction in the average selling price  and or a reduction in our gross margin include a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our older products as our new products are introduced 
because market conditions are uncertain  these and other factors could materially adversely affect our business 
we may have failed to adequately insure against certain risks  and  as a result  our financial condition and results may be adversely affected 
we carry insurance customary for companies in our industry  including  but not limited to  liability  property and casualty  worker s compensation and business interruption insurance 
we also insure our employees for basic medical expenses 
in addition  we have insurance contracts that provide director and officer liability coverage for our directors and officers 
other than the specific areas mentioned above  we are self insured with respect to most other risks and exposures  and the insurance we carry in many cases is subject to a significant policy deductible or other limitation before coverage applies 
based on management s assessment and judgment  we have determined that it is more cost effective to self insure against certain risks than to incur the insurance premium costs 
the risks and exposures for which we self insure include  but are not limited to  natural disasters  product defects  political risk  theft  patent infringement and some employment practice matters 
should there be a catastrophic loss due to an uninsured event such as an earthquake or a loss due to adverse occurrences in any area in which we are self insured  our financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected

item selected financial data 
year ended december  january  january  january  december  in thousands  except per share data statement of operations data revenue costs and expenses cost of products sold research and development selling  general and administrative impairment loss on goodwill acquisition related and amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income loss basic net income loss per share diluted net income loss per share shares used in per share calculations basic diluted at december  january  january  january  december  in thousands balance sheet data cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities total assets convertible notes stockholders equity at december   the estimated fair value of the company was below book value 
therefore  the company performed an impairment test on goodwill in accordance with asc we calculated the impairment loss based on an allocation of the fair value of the company s equity to the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in a business combination 
fair value was based on two primary valuation methodologies the income approach  which used the discounted cash flow method  and the market approach  which used the market capitalization method 
in the allocation  goodwill was determined to have no implied fair value  and  as a result  goodwill related to the acquisition of vantis corporation on june   the acquisition of integrated intellectual properties  inc on march   and the acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc on january  totaling million was written off and recorded as an impairment loss on goodwill 
as a result  we no longer have goodwill related to these acquisitions recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
on december   we began to implement a global tax structure to more effectively align the company s corporate structure and transaction flows with the company s geographic business operations including responsibility for sales and purchasing activities 
we have numerous sales offices in foreign locations  operational centers in the philippines and singapore  and research and development sites in china  india and the philippines 
revenues from non domestic regions account for over of all revenue 
in addition  the large majority of our suppliers are located in the asia pacific region 
based on these factors we have created new and realigned existing legal entities  intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property  inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions  and implemented cost sharing and intellectual property licensing and royalty agreements between our us and low cost tax jurisdictions 
these actions created a gain for tax purposes  for which we recorded a million tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal this provision was fully offset by the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million recorded as a tax benefit during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that the global tax structure will be completed during the first quarter of upon the intercompany sale of inventory and fixed assets  and we expect to record approximately million in additional income tax provision during the first quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of  we also concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets 
we based this conclusion on improved operating results over the past two years and our expectations about generating taxable income in the foreseeable future including the implementation of a global tax structure discussed above 
based on our assessment regarding the potential to realize deferred tax assets  we reversed additional valuation allowance  which when offset by the provision recorded related to our new global tax structure  resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
we exercised significant judgment and considered estimates about our ability to generate revenues  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods under our new tax structure in reaching this decision 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview lattice semiconductor corporation lattice or the company designs  develops and markets programmable logic products and related software 
programmable logic products are widely used semiconductor components that can be configured by end customers as specific logic circuits  enabling shorter design cycle times and reduced development costs 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers oems in the communications  computing  consumer  industrial  military  automotive  and medical end markets 
within the programmable logic market there are two groups of products programmable logic devices pld and field programmable gate arrays fpga each representing a distinct silicon architectural approach 
products based on the two alternative programmable logic architectures are generally optimal for different types of logic functions  although many logic functions can be implemented using either architecture 
we believe that a substantial portion of programmable logic customers utilize both pld and fpga architectures 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a description of our critical accounting policies follows 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classification of assets  such as marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventory  auction rate securities  goodwill including the assessment of reporting unit  intangible assets  deferred income taxes and liabilities  such as accrued liabilities including restructuring charges and bonus arrangements  income taxes and deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the fiscal periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and deferred income 
revenue from sales to customers is recognized upon shipment  or in the case of sales by our sell through distributors  at the time of reported resale  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer remaining acceptance requirements and no remaining significant obligations 
we sell our products directly to end customers or through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and indirectly through a network of independent sell in and sell through distributors 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer when products are resold as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
we must use estimates and apply judgment to reconcile sell through distributors reported inventories to their activities 
any error in our judgment could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenue  cost of products sold  deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors  and net income loss 
at the time of shipment to a sell through distributor we invoice at published list price 
the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
invoices are recorded in accounts receivable  net with a corresponding credit to deferred income and allowances on sales to sell though distributors and inventory is credited from inventories with a corresponding charge to deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors 
at the time of shipment to a sell through distributor amounts are invoiced at published list price 
the final price is set at the time of resale and is determined in accordance with a distributor price agreement 
amounts invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable  net and inventory is transferred from inventories to deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors 
revenue and cost of products sold to sell through distributors are deferred until either the product is resold by the distributor or  in certain cases  return privileges terminate  at which time revenue and cost of products sold are reflected in net income loss 
the components of deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors are presented in the following table in thousands december  january  inventory valued at published list price and held by sell through distributors with right of return allowance for distributor advances deferred cost of sales related to inventory held by sell through distributors total deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors during fiscal  the company embarked on a program to restructure our distribution channels primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result  the majority of our revenue in fiscal and was from resale of our products by sell through distributors 
resale of product by sell through distributors as a percentage of our total revenue was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from software licensing was not material for the periods presented 
fair value of financial instruments 
we invest in various financial instruments including corporate and government bonds  notes  commercial paper and auction rate securities 
we value these instruments at their fair value and monitor our portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  we record an impairment charge and establish a new carrying value 
we assess other than temporary impairment of marketable securities in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the framework under the provisions of asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
level instruments generally represent quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
therefore  determining fair value for level instruments generally does not require significant management judgment  and the estimation is not difficult 
level instruments include inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level instruments include unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the determination of fair value for level instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity 
inventory 
inventories are recorded at the lower of actual cost approximated by standard cost determined on a first in first out basis or market 
we establish provisions for inventory if it is in excess of projected customer demand  and the creation of such provisions results in a write down of inventory to net realizable value and a charge to cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets  primarily property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  which requires us to review the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount 
a loss is recorded if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flow for the difference between carrying value and fair value 
valuation of goodwill 
goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized 
we review goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the entity must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation and the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment we operate as a single reporting unit 
no impairment charges relating to goodwill was recorded for the fiscal year ended restructuring charges 
expenses associated with exit or disposal activities are recognized when incurred under asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  for everything but severance 
because we have a history of paying severance benefits  the cost of severance benefits associated with a restructuring charge is recorded when such costs are probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits 
for leased facilities that are vacated  an amount equal to the total future lease obligations from the date of vacating the premises through the expiration of the lease  net of any future sublease income  is recorded as a part of restructuring charges 
accounting for income taxes 
our provision for income tax is comprised of our current tax liability and change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the difference is expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that in management s judgment is more likely than not to be recoverable against future taxable income 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes were not provided for on a cumulative total of approximately million of the undistributed earnings of our chinese subsidiary 
we intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our chinese subsidiary 
if these earnings were distributed to the us in the form of dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
our income tax calculations are based on application of the respective us federal  state or foreign tax law 
the company s tax filings  however  are subject to audit by the relevant tax authorities 
accordingly  we recognize tax liabilities based upon its estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
to the extent the final tax liabilities are different than the amounts originally accrued  the increases or decreases are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we evaluate both positive and negative evidence that may exist and considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
any adjustment to the net deferred tax asset valuation allowance is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the period that the adjustment is determined to be required 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of substantially all share based awards consistent with the provisions of asc option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected term  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected term are the two assumptions that significantly affect the grant date fair value 
restricted stock unit grants are part of the company s equity compensation practices for employees who receive equity grants 
the restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest quarterly over a four year period beginning on the grant date 
results of operations key elements of our consolidated statements of operations were as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  january  january  revenue gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative acquisition related charges restructuring charges income loss from operations revenue revenue in fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to an increase in revenue from new products 
revenue in fiscal increased to million as compared to million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in revenue from new  mainstream and mature products 
a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on the health of the communications end market  which accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
forecasting future revenue by end market is particularly challenging as revenue growth is dependent on overall economic conditions for our industry and market acceptance of our new products 
on december   the company completed the purchase of siliconblue technologies ltd  a cayman islands exempted company siliconblue a developer of a single chip  ultra low power field programmable gate array solution for handheld devices 
the acquisition of siliconblue is part of the company s effort to expand its presence in the consumer end market with low power programmable logic devices for the smartphone market 
siliconblue was consolidated into our financial statements beginning on december  the revenue of siliconblue recorded in our consolidated statement of operations from the acquisition date through december  was million  and was included in our pld product line  mature revenue and consumer end market summary tables below 
revenue by product line there was a increase for fiscal compared to fiscal in fpga units sold primarily driven by an increase in demand for our new products  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price 
pld revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a increase in units sold primarily related to new and mature products  partially offset by a decrease in average selling price 
pld and fpga revenue increased in fiscal  when compared to fiscal due to an increase in units sold for both product lines  primarily related to revenue from our new products 
the composition of our revenue by product line for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  january  january  fpga pld total revenue revenue by end market the global communications end market accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our revenue for this end market is largely dependent on five large telecommunications equipment providers  however  none exceeded of revenue in fiscal or  and one accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal  resulting from sell through resale by one of our distributors 
although revenue from the communications end market declined in fiscal when compared to fiscal  we expect that a significant portion of our revenue will continue to be dependent on the health of the communications end market  which experienced a downtrend in the second half of fiscal revenue from the industrial and other end market increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal and in fiscal when compared to fiscal revenue from the computing end market decreased in fiscal when compared to fiscal  but increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal revenue from the consumer end market increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal and for fiscal as compared to fiscal the composition of our revenue by end market for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  january  january  communications industrial and other computing consumer total revenue revenue by product classification revenue for new products increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased unit sales 
revenue from mainstream products decreased for fiscal but increased for fiscal primarily related to a decrease and increase in unit sales  respectively 
mature product revenue increased in fiscal and increased for fiscal primarily related to an increase in unit sales 
the composition of our revenue by product classification for fiscal years  and was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  january  january  new mainstream mature total revenue product classification new latticeecp  latticexp  latticeecp m  machxo  power manager ii  ispclocka d s  ispmach ze  ice mainstream ispxpld  ispgdx  ispmach z  ispxpga  latticesc  latticeecp  latticexp  ispclock  power manager i  software and ip mature fpsc  orca  orca  orca  isppac  isplsi v  ispmach b  ispmach lv  ispmach lv  isplsi v  isplsi v  ispmach vg  all volt cplds  gdx v  ispmach lv  ice  all splds product categories are modified as appropriate relative to our portfolio of products and the generation within each major product family 
new products consist of our latest generation of products  while mainstream and mature are older or based on unique late stage customer based production needs 
generally  product categories are adjusted every two to three years  at which time prior periods are reclassified to conform to the new categorization 
in fiscal we reclassified our new  mainstream and mature product categories to better reflect our current product portfolio 
no changes were made in fiscal revenue by geography the composition of our revenue by geographical location of our direct and indirect customers was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  january  january  total total total united states china europe japan taiwan other asia other americas total foreign revenue total revenue we assign revenue to geographies based on customer ship to address at the point where revenue is recognized 
in the case of sell in distributors and oem customers  revenue is typically recognized  and geography is assigned  when products are shipped to our distributor or customer 
in the case of sell through distributors  revenue is recognized when resale occurs and geography is assigned based on the customer location on the resale reports provided by the distributor 
revenue from foreign sales as a percentage of total revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal we believe the foreign market to the asia pacific region will remain the primary source of our revenue due to relatively more favorable business conditions in asia and a continuing trend towards outsourcing of manufacturing by north american and european customers to the asia pacific region 
revenue from distributors our largest customers are distributors and have historically made up a significant portion of our total revenue 
revenue attributable to resales of products by arrow electronics  inc  which includes its wholly owned subsidiary  nu horizons electronics corp  accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by avnet  inc avnet  accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
revenue attributable to resales of products by the weikeng group weikeng industrial co 
ltd 
taiwan and weikeng international co 
ltd 
hong kong accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales of products to asti holdings ltd 
accounted for approximately  and of revenue in fiscal years  and  respectively 
no other individual customer accounted for more than of total revenue in any of the fiscal years  and on august   our global franchise agreement with avnet terminated  however  we mutually agreed to terms for the transition of inventory through december  we do not expect a significant disruption in our ability to service customers as a result of this change 
we continue to serve our end customers with a network that includes a global distributor  regional distributors  manufacturer s representatives  and our direct sales team 
during fiscal  we embarked on a program to restructure our distribution channels  primarily in the asia pacific region  from a sell in to a sell through distribution model 
as a result the majority of our revenue in fiscal and was from resale of our products by sell through distributors 
in connection with this program  we terminated our distribution agreement between the company and promaster technology corporation on july   between the company and dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics effective for various territories on february and february   respectively  and between the company and other distributors effective on various dates 
dragon technology distribution and fe global electronics are wholly owned subsidiaries of asti holdings ltd 
additionally  we converted in place distributors in the asia pacific region and europe from a sell in to a sell through model 
as a result  we estimate that revenue was lower in the fourth quarter of fiscal by approximately million compared to revenue had we not embarked on this program 
revenue related to resale of our products by sell through distributors makes up   and of total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin and operating expenses our gross margin percentage was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in gross margin percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to an increase in new product revenue which typically carries a lower gross margin than our mainstream and mature products 
the increase in gross margin percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to the significantly higher production volume in fiscal when compared to fixed overhead costs charged to cost of products sold 
additionally  due to the broad based nature of our revenue increase  revenue from our mature and mainstream products  which typically carry a higher gross margin than our new product categories  increased during fiscal we also realized a benefit related to some sales of older  fully reserved products in fiscal research and development expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  masks  engineering wafers  third party design automation software  test equipment and tooling depreciation  and qualification expenses 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was related to personnel  masks  engineering wafers  third party design automation software  test equipment and tooling depreciation and qualification expense 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was related to personnel related costs  primarily accrued bonus costs recorded in connection with the cash incentive compensation plan  as well as an increase in outside service costs for engineering development 
we believe that a continued commitment to research and development is essential to maintain product leadership and provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore we expect to continue to make significant future investments in research and development 
as we continue to move to more advanced process technologies  our mask and engineering wafer costs are becoming more expensive and will therefore increasingly represent a greater proportion of total research and development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of an increase in labor related costs  sales commission costs  legal costs  and outside service costs for marketing and financial consulting 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in sales commission costs  marketing related costs and accrued bonus costs recorded in connection with the cash incentive compensation plan 
acquisition related charges were million in fiscal  none in fiscal and million in fiscal the charges in fiscal include million in professional service and legal fees  and million amortization of intangible assets related to our december  acquisition of siliconblue 
we estimate charges related to amortization of intangible assets will be approximately million for fiscal  and million in professional service type charges 
fiscal acquisition related charges relate to our acquisition of the fpga business of agere systems  inc and of cerdelinx technologies  inc the company implemented restructuring plans during the fiscal years    and included in our consolidated statements of operations and reported as restructuring charges for fiscal  and are charges of million  less than million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from severance and related costs and costs to vacate leased properties under these restructuring plans 
other income  net the following table summarizes the activity in other income  net in thousands year ended december  january  january  interest income gain related to sale or fair value adjustment  net of impairment charges on auction rate securities gain on sale of real estate loss gain on deferred compensation plan assets and other  net total the increase in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal relates to higher invested balances in fiscal when compared to fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal relates to lower interest rates on invested balances 
benefit provision for income taxes benefit for income taxes resulted from a portion of our deferred tax valuation allowance reversed and the recognition of previously unrecognized uncertain tax positions  partially offset by a provision recorded related to our new global tax structure and foreign taxes 
on december   we began to implement a global tax structure to more effectively align the company s corporate structure and transaction flows with the company s geographic business operations including responsibility for sales and purchasing activities 
we have numerous sales offices in foreign locations  operational centers in the philippines and singapore  and research and development sites in china  india and the philippines 
revenues from non domestic regions account for over of all revenue 
in addition  the large majority of our suppliers are located in the asia pacific region 
based on these factors we have created new and realigned existing legal entities  intercompany sales of rights to intellectual property  inventory and fixed assets across different tax jurisdictions  and implemented cost sharing and intellectual property licensing and royalty agreements between our us and low cost tax jurisdictions 
these actions created a gain for tax purposes  for which we recorded a million tax provision in the fourth quarter of fiscal this provision was fully offset by the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million recorded as a tax benefit during the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect that the global tax structure will be completed during the first quarter of upon the intercompany sale of inventory and fixed assets  and we expect to record approximately million in additional income tax provision during the first quarter of fiscal  which will result in an increase to the effective tax rate 
during the fourth quarter of  we also concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize the benefit of a portion of our remaining deferred tax assets 
we based this conclusion on improved operating results over the past two years and our expectations about generating taxable income in the foreseeable future including the implementation of a global tax structure discussed above 
based on our assessment regarding the potential to realize deferred tax assets  we reversed additional valuation allowance  which when offset by the provision recorded related to our new global tax structure  resulted in an income tax benefit of million 
we exercised significant judgment and considered estimates about our ability to generate revenues  gross profits  operating income and taxable income in future periods under our new tax structure in reaching this decision 
we are not currently paying federal income taxes and do not expect to pay such taxes until the benefits of our tax net operating losses and credits are fully utilized 
we expect to pay a nominal amount of state income tax 
we accrue interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the provision for income taxes 
we are paying foreign income taxes which are primarily related to the cost of operating offshore research and development and marketing subsidiaries 
the inherent uncertainties related to the geographical distribution  and relative levels of profits among various high and low tax jurisdictions make it difficult to quantify the impact of the global tax structure on our future effective tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition sources and uses of cash our sources and uses of cash from operating  financing and investing activities were as follows in thousands year ended december  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents fiscal compared to operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the decrease in comparable periods is primarily the result of a decrease in net income before income taxes from million to million and the use of foundry advances of million in fiscal and no such transactions in fiscal in addition  other significant items of operating activities include net cash was provided by a reduction in accounts receivable  net of million in fiscal but was used in operations as the result of an increase of million in fiscal billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal were relatively low when compared to billings in the fourth quarter of fiscal net cash was provided by a reduction in inventory of million in fiscal but was used in operations as the result of an increase of million in fiscal the increase in inventory in fiscal was driven by demand for our product to support quarterly sequential revenue increases through the second quarter of fiscal  at which time revenue then declined on a quarterly sequential basis 
net cash was used in operations as a result of a decrease in deferred income and allowances on sales to sell through distributors of million in fiscal but was provided by operations as the result of an increase of million in fiscal this decrease in fiscal is primarily related to the termination of our distribution agreement with avnet 
net cash was used in operation as a result of a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses includes restructuring and accrued payroll obligations of million in fiscal but was provided by operations as the result of an increase of million in fiscal net cash was provided by operations as a result of an increase in other liabilities of million in fiscal but was used in operations as the result of a decrease of million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is primarily related to an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal the increase in net cash used for comparable periods is primarily the result of million used in the acquisition of siliconblue on december  net cash was used in investing activities for net purchases greater than proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million in fiscal compared to net cash used in investing activities as the result of net purchases greater than proceeds from sales of marketable securities of million in fiscal capital expenditures decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal of million primarily due to an increase in cash used to buy treasury stock of million in fiscal from million in fiscal fiscal compared to operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the receipt of a million repayment in fiscal  of the company s advance payment made to fujitsu limited fujitsu in fiscal  while no receipt occurred in fiscal  and a decrease in usage of fujitsu advance credits from million in fiscal to million in usage in fiscal offsetting these amounts was an increase in cash flow from net income loss due to net income of million in fiscal compared to a net loss of million in fiscal in addition other significant items of operating activities include net cash used in operations as the result of increased inventory of million in fiscal compared to cash provided by operations as the result of a decrease in inventory of million in fiscal net cash provided by operations due to an increase in accrued payroll obligations of million in fiscal compared to a decrease of million in fiscal investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal as purchases of marketable securities exceeded sales of marketable securities and short term marketable securities increased by million as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet when fiscal is compared to fiscal capital expenditures increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash used by financing activities in fiscal of million primarily due to the issuance of common stock of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  offset by the increase in purchase of treasury stock of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal liquidity as of december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities  which was approximately million less than the balance of million at january  working capital decreased to million at december   from million at january  the primary reason for decline in both measures above is attributed to our million cash purchase of siliconblue and our million purchase of treasury stock under our stock repurchase program  partially offset by cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that our existing liquid resources and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations for at least the next twelve months 
we have no long term debt 
at december  and january   the company held auction rate securities with a par value of million and million  respectively 
the company intends to sell its auction rate securities as markets for these securities resume or reasonable offers become available 
at december   due to continued multiple failed auctions and a determination of illiquidity  the million par value of auction rate securities held by the company had an estimated fair value of million and are classified as long term marketable securities 
these auction rate securities are exposed to risks associated with student loan asset backed notes 
such loans are insured by the federal government or guaranteed by the federal family educational loan program 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  the amount realized could be materially different than the estimated fair value amounts at which we are carrying these securities and there could be a materially detrimental effect on our financial results 
in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities  the company recorded an unrealized loss of million during the year ended december  on certain short term marketable securities  which has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
future fluctuations in fair value related to these instruments that the company deems to be temporary  including any recoveries of previous write downs  would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the year ended december   approximately million in unrealized losses related to the increase in fair value of auction rate securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if the company were to determine in the future that any further decline in fair value is other than temporary  we would record an impairment charge  which could have a materially detrimental impact on our operating results 
if we were to liquidate our position in these securities  it is likely that the amount of any future realized gain or loss would be different from the unrealized gain or loss reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
on february   the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which up to million of outstanding common stock may be repurchased from time to time 
the duration of the repurchase program is twelve months 
all repurchases will be open market transactions and funded from available working capital 
on october   the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which up to million of outstanding common stock could have been repurchased 
the duration of the repurchase program was twelve months from adoption 
in connection with this stock repurchase program  the company entered into a b plan 
during fiscal  approximately million shares were repurchased for million 
during fiscal  approximately million shares were repurchased for million 
all shares repurchased under this program were retired by december  all repurchases were open market transactions and were funded from available working capital 
the program ended by its terms in october on december   the company s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which up to million of outstanding common stock could have been repurchased 
in connection with the stock repurchase program  we entered into a b plan 
the duration of the repurchase program was twelve months  and expired on december  during fiscal  approximately  shares were repurchased for million  all of which were open market transactions and were funded from available working capital 
all shares repurchased under this program were retired in on august   the company entered into an agreement with a bank under the terms of which we could borrow up to million in japanese yen in a revolving line of credit arrangement 
in the first fiscal quarter of  we amended the agreement to reduce the line of credit to million 
outstanding borrowings were collateralized by a market rate investment account 
interest on outstanding borrowings were based on the japanese libor fixed rate 
outstanding borrowings at january  were million and were reported in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets 
this arrangement was terminated by the company during the first quarter of fiscal we may in the future seek new or additional sources of funding 
in addition  in order to secure additional wafer supply  we may from time to time consider various financial arrangements including equity investments  advance purchase payments  loans  or similar arrangements with independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for committed wafer capacity 
to the extent that we pursue any such additional financing arrangements  additional debt or equity financing may be required 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available when needed or  if available  will be on favorable terms 
any future equity financing will decrease existing stockholders equity percentage ownership and may  depending on the price at which the equity is sold  result in dilution 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual cash obligations at december  in thousands fiscal year operating leases purchase order obligations thereafter certain of our facilities and equipment are leased under operating leases  which expire at various times through this column excludes amounts already recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as current or long term liabilities at december  we also have other liabilities of million relating to uncertain tax positions 
however  as we are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions  we have excluded this amount from the table above 
our significant operating leases are for our facilities in san jose  california  bethlehem  pennsylvania  shanghai  china and downers grove  illinois 
our lease in san jose expires in december with annual rental costs estimated to be million with annual increases 
our lease in bethlehem expires in september with annual rental costs estimated to be million with annual increases 
our lease in shanghai expires in may with remaining rental costs estimated to be million 
our lease in downers grove expires in august with annual rental costs estimated to be million 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the non cancelable lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity was eliminated 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
these changes become effective for the company on january  we will adopt this standard in the first quarter of fiscal in may  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value measurement and related disclosures 
the new guidance clarified the concepts applicable for fair value measurement of non financial assets and requires the disclosure of quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in a fair value measurement 
this guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december   and will be applied prospectively 
we are in the process of evaluating the financial and disclosure impact of this guidance 
we do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance 
in september  the fasb issued amended guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
this guidance will be effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we are in the process of evaluating the financial and disclosure impact of this guidance 
we do not anticipate a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption of this amended guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit market risks at december  and january   we held auction rate securities with a face value of million and million  respectively 
at december   the auction rate securities held by us had an estimated fair value of million 
at january   the auction rate securities had an estimated fair value of million 
our investments in auction rate securities are subject to interest rate and market risk 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio 
if the market for our investment portfolio declines  our consolidated operating results may be negatively impacted 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have international subsidiary and branch operations 
in addition  a portion of our silicon wafer and other purchases are denominated in japanese yen and we bill our japanese customers in yen 
we mitigate the resulting foreign currency exchange rate exposure by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for japanese yen 
although such hedges mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate exposure from an economic perspective they were not designated as effective hedges for accounting purposes and are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
as a result of the use of derivative financial instruments  lattice is exposed to the risk that counter parties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations 
to mitigate the counter party credit risk  lattice enters into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
on december   the company had two forward contracts to deliver a total of million yen by january  the contracts were settled by that date
