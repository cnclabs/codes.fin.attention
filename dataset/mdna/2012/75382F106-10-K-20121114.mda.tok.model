item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of august   and the notes to such consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
plan of operation and overview we are an emerging biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing life altering therapeutics that treat debilitating and often fatal diseases 
our initial focus is on developing our first product candidate  rp  as a potential treatment for cystinosis  a rare genetic disorder 
cystinosis patients are at very high risk of experiencing life threatening metabolic disorders  including kidney failure  severe gastrointestinal dysfunction and rickets as a result of an accumulation of the amino acid  cystine  in cells 
as a result  cystinosis patients have a substantially reduced life span relative to unaffected individuals 
in july  we announced that rp had met the sole primary endpoint in our phase clinical trial designed to evaluate rp as a potential treatment for cystinosis 
in the first quarter of calendar  we submitted an nda to the fda requesting approval to market rp as a potential treatment for cystinosis 
the fda granted standard review designation for rp and has assigned the user fee goal date by which we anticipate a response from the fda of january  also in the first quarter of calendar  we submitted an maa to the ema requesting approval to market rp as a potential treatment for cystinosis 
in addition to cystinosis  we are also testing rp for the potential treatment of nash  a metabolic liver disorder  and hd  a neurodegenerative disorder 
clinical development programs our three active clinical development programs utilize the same active pharmaceutical ingredient cysteamine bitartrate 
cysteamine bitartrate was approved in as an orally available immediate release powder in a capsule for the treatment of  and is the current standard of care for cystinosis 
we are reformulating cysteamine bitartrate to potentially improve the dose administration  safety and or efficacy compared to existing treatment and repurposing cysteamine bitartrate for potential applications in new disease indications 
our proprietary delayed release formulation  rp  is a capsule containing enteric coated micro beads of cysteamine bitartrate 
we believe rp will require less frequent dosing and could reduce gastro intestinal and other side effects compared to immediate release cysteamine bitartrate for cystinosis patients 
in addition to cystinosis  we are also testing rp for the potential treatment of nash and hd 
rp is our enteric coated tablet formulation of cysteamine bitartrate in development 
we obtained the exclusive worldwide license to delayed release cysteamine  which is the basis for our proprietary formulations of cysteamine  through the merger of our clinical subsidiary and encode  formerly a privately held product development company 
our other clinical stage product candidate is convivia  our proprietary oral formulation of methylpyrazole  for the potential management of acetaldehyde toxicity due to alcohol consumption by individuals with aldehyde dehydrogenase  or aldh deficiency  an inherited metabolic disorder 
preclinical product candidates our preclinical platforms consist of targeted therapeutics for the potential treatment of multiple indications  including liver diseases  neurodegenerative diseases and breast cancer 
we are seeking development partners for these programs 
these preclinical programs include the following our receptor associated protein  or rap  platform consists of heptide for the potential treatment of primary liver cancer and other liver diseases  and neurotrans to potentially deliver therapeutics across the blood brain barrier for treatment of a variety of neurological diseases  and our mesoderm development protein  or mesd  platform consists of wnttide for the potential treatment of breast cancer 
future activities over the next fiscal year  we plan to conduct research and development and general and administrative activities including pre commercial launch preparation of rp in the us and eu  including preparing commercial materials and coordinating drug supply and  if approved  conducting a commercial launch of rp in the us and eu  supporting our ongoing extension study of rp in cystinosis until patients are converted onto commercial drug  conducting other supporting clinical studies of rp in cystinosis  supplying clinical material for our ongoing clinical trial of rp in hd  funding the collaboration and supplying clinical material in our ongoing phase b clinical trial of rp in nash  continuing business development of our preclinical product candidates  conducting research and development activities for in licensed and newly discovered preclinical assets  supporting potential clinical trials of rp in malaria  rett syndrome  fibrosis and parkinson s disease subject to potential external funding  and supporting associated facilities and administrative functions 
we plan to seek additional business development partners for our convivia product candidate in asia 
we may also develop new preclinical  clinical and or commercial opportunities  including proprietary targets discovered in house and in licensed and acquired technologies 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the us preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial position 
many of the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
functional currency our consolidated functional currency is the us dollar 
raptor pharmaceuticals europe bv bv and rptp european holdings bv cv  our european subsidiary and cayman based subsidiary  respectively  use the european euro as their functional currency 
at each quarter end  bv s and the cv s balance sheets are translated into us dollars based upon the quarter end exchange rate  while their statements of comprehensive loss are translated into us dollars based upon an average of the euro s value between the beginning and end date of the reporting period 
bv s and cv s equity are adjusted for any translation gain or loss 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  prepaid expenses  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and capital lease liability approximate fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in our consolidated financial statements 
the warrant liability is carried at fair value which is determined using the black scholes option valuation model at the end of each reporting period 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less  when purchased  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain cash and cash equivalents  which consist principally of money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions 
such amounts exceed federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
we have not experienced any losses on these investments 
restricted cash represents compensating balances required by our us and european banks as collateral for credit cards 
short term investments we invest in short term investments in high credit quality funds in order to obtain higher yields on our idle cash 
such investments are not insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
we completed an evaluation of our investments and determined that we did not have any other than temporary impairments as of august  the investments are placed in financial institutions with strong credit ratings and management expects full recovery of the carrying amounts 
prepaid expenses and other prepaid expenses consists primarily of advance payments to vendors that are due within one year 
other consists primarily of a receivable of million resulting from a timing difference in the receipt of cash proceeds from the sale of common stock under our at the market sales agreement as discussed in note in our consolidated financial statements attached as an exhibit to this annual report on form k 
deferred offering costs deferred offering costs represent expenses incurred to raise equity capital related to financing transactions which have not yet been completed as of the balance sheet dates 
intangible assets intangible assets include the intellectual property and other rights relating to dr cysteamine currently developed as rp and rp and to an out license acquired in the merger 
the intangible assets related to rp rp are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years  which is the life of the intellectual property patents 
the year estimated useful life is also based upon the typical development  approval  marketing and life cycle management timelines of pharmaceutical drug products 
the intangible assets related to the out license will be amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years  which is the life of the intellectual property patents 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the value of the purchase consideration over the identifiable assets acquired in the merger 
goodwill is reviewed annually  or when an indication of impairment exists  to determine if any impairment analysis and resulting write down in valuation is necessary 
fixed assets fixed assets  which mainly consist of leasehold improvements  lab equipment  computer hardware and software and capital lease equipment  are stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the related estimated useful lives  except for leasehold improvements and capital lease equipment  which are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term 
significant additions and improvements that have useful lives estimated at greater than one year are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of the carrying amounts to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
should an impairment exist  the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset s fair value or discounted estimates of future cash flows 
as of august   we determined that the capitalized acquired in process research and development cost of million  representing the tezampanel and ngx program acquired in the merger  was impaired due to our decision to discontinue development for thrombosis due to regulatory hurdles that would require significant expenditures which we chose not to prioritize for funding 
as such  we expensed million as in process research and development as part of research and development expense on our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the year ended august  common stock warrant liabilities the warrants issued by us in the private placement contain a cash out provision which may be triggered upon request by the warrant holders if we are acquired or upon the occurrence of certain other fundamental transactions involving us 
this provision requires these warrants to be classified as liabilities and to be marked to market at each period end commencing on august  the warrants issued by us in our december equity financing contain a conditional obligation that may require us to transfer assets to repurchase the warrants upon the occurrence of potential future events 
under the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  distinguishing liabilities from equity  a financial instrument that may require the issuer to settle the obligation by transferring assets is classified as a liability 
therefore  we have classified the warrants as liabilities and will mark them to fair value at each period end 
the common stock warrants are re measured at the end of every reporting period with the change in value reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
warrants which are recorded as liabilities that are exercised are re measured and marked to market the day prior to exercise 
upon exercise of such warrants  the fair value of such warrants is reclassified to equity 
income taxes income taxes are recorded under the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
our effective tax rate is for income tax for the year ended august  based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative losses since inception and expected future losses  we have determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset amount will not be realized and therefore a full valuation allowance has been provided on our net deferred tax assets 
utilization of our net operating loss nol carryovers may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change rules under the internal revenue code and similar state income tax law provisions including those related to the suspension and limitation of nol carryovers for certain tax years 
such an annual limitation could result in the expiration of our nol carryovers before utilization 
on september   we adopted the provisions of asc no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
asc requires entities following gaap to identify uncertain tax positions and disclose any potential tax liability on their financial statements using a two step process  which includes recognition and measurement 
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 
as of august   there was no accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
we file us federal  california  georgia and north carolina state income tax returns and dutch income tax returns 
we are currently not subject to any income tax examinations 
due to our nols  generally all tax years remain open 
research and development we are a development stage biotechnology company 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
research and development expenses include medical  clinical  regulatory and scientists salaries and benefits  commercial manufacturing prior to drug approval  lab collaborations  preclinical studies  clinical trials  clinical trial materials  regulatory and clinical consultants  lab supplies  lab services  lab equipment maintenance and small equipment purchased to support the research laboratory  amortization of intangible assets and allocated executive  human resources and facilities expenses 
research and development expenses are offset by contra expenses which are reimbursements of research and development expenses received either from research collaborators or from government grants or tax rebates 
in process research and development prior to september   we recorded in process research and development expense for a product candidate acquisition where there is not more than one potential product or usage for the assets being acquired 
upon the adoption of the revised guidance on business combinations  effective september   the fair value of acquired in process research and development is capitalized and tested for impairment at least annually 
upon completion of the research and development activities  the intangible asset is amortized into earnings over the related product s useful life 
in process research and development that is amortized or expensed is recorded as part of research and development expenses on our statements of operations 
we review each product candidate acquisition to determine the existence of in process research and development 
comprehensive loss components of comprehensive loss are reported in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they are recognized 
the components of comprehensive loss include net loss and foreign currency translation adjustments 
stock based compensation in february  our board of directors approved  and in march our stockholders approved  our equity incentive plan  or the plan  to grant up to an aggregate of  stock options or restricted stock or restricted stock units over the ten year life of the plan 
our board of directors has determined not to make any new grants under any of our former plans  but rather under the plan 
the plan s term is ten years and allows for the granting of options to employees  directors and consultants 
on april   our stockholders passed amendments to the plan which allow for an increase of the grant pool based upon of our common stock outstanding as of april   august  and august  up to an aggregate maximum increase of  shares 
the april   august  and august  increases added   and  shares  respectively  available for grant under the plan 
the amendments also allow for accelerated vesting of unvested stock options upon a change of control as defined in the plan  as amended 
in september  our board of directors approved an amended and restated form of award agreement to the plan  which will be used for awards granted on or after september  the amended and restated award agreement  subject to the terms of any applicable employment agreement  extends the termination date of the awards granted under the plan that are vested as of such termination date due to a an employee s retirement or a non employee director s voluntary cessation of service at age or older which employee or non employee director has at least five years of continuous service with us prior to such retirement or cessation  b the termination of a non employee director s board membership for reasons other than for cause or voluntary cessation of service and c an employee s or a non employee director s death during his or her continuous service with us or within days of such continuous service with us or permanent disability 
in may  rpc s stockholders approved the equity compensation plan  as amended  referred to herein as the plan 
the plan s term is ten years and allows for the granting of options to employees  directors and consultants 
effective as of the effective time of the merger  we assumed the outstanding stock options of rpc granted under the plan 
such assumed options are subject to the terms of the plan and  in each case  are also subject to the terms and conditions of an incentive stock option agreement  non qualified stock option agreement or other option award  as the case may be  issued under such plan 
prior to the merger  and subject to the merger becoming effective  our board of directors adopted the plan such that the plan became an equity incentive plan of ours after the merger 
typical option grants under the and plans are for ten years with exercise prices at the market price based on the last closing price as of the date prior to the grant date on the relevant stock market or exchange and vest over four years as follows ths on the six month anniversary of the date of grant  and th per month thereafter 
effective september   our stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with asc topic  accounting for compensation arrangements  or asc topic previously listed as statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  and related interpretations 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating future stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behavior 
in march  the fasb issued asc topic previously listed as staff accounting bulletin no 
 which offers guidance for what was previously referred to as sfas r 
asc topic was issued to assist preparers by simplifying some of the implementation challenges of sfas r while enhancing the information that investors receive 
asc topic creates a framework that is premised on two overarching themes a considerable judgment will be required by preparers to successfully implement sfas r  specifically when valuing employee stock options  and b reasonable individuals  acting in good faith  may conclude differently on the fair value of employee stock options 
key topics covered by asc topic include valuation models  expected volatility and expected term 
for the year ended august   stock based compensation expense was based on the black scholes option pricing model assuming the following risk free interest rate of to  year expected life  to volatility  turnover rate  and dividend rate 
we based our black scholes inputs on the following factors the risk free interest rate was based upon our review of current constant maturity treasury bill rates for seven and five years average  the expected life of five to six years was based upon our assessment of the ten year term of the stock options issued along with the fact that we are a development stage company and our anticipation that option holders will exercise stock options when we are at a more mature stage of development  the volatility was based on the actual volatility of our common stock price as quoted on nasdaq since the closing of our merger on september   the turnover rate was based on our assessment of our historical employee turnover  and the dividend rate was based on our current decision to not pay dividends on our stock at our current development stage 
if factors change and different assumptions are employed in the application of asc topic  the compensation expense recorded in future periods may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our accounting for stock based compensation 
we recognize as consulting expense the fair value of options granted to persons who are neither employees nor directors 
stock options issued to consultants are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of the fasb asc topic  equity based payments to non employees previously listed as emerging issues task force  or eitf  consensus no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
the fair value of expensed options is based on the black scholes option pricing model assuming the same factors as stock based compensation expense discussed above

current status of major programs please refer to the item of this annual report on form k for a detailed discussion of each of our major programs 
in summary  rp is being developed in cystinosis  and rp is being developed in nash and hd 
in march  we filed with the fda and the ema for marketing approval of rp for cystinosis and anticipate a decision by the fda by january  pdufa date and by the ema by the first half of calendar in anticipation of marketing approval of rp for the potential treatment of cystinosis  we are preparing for potential launch in both the us and the eu 
in june  we commenced a phase b clinical trial of rp in nash with the national institutes of health and anticipate full enrollment in the first quarter of calendar and the potential release of data in the first half of calendar in june  we announced the full enrollment of our hd phase clinical trial of rp and the potential release of data in the first half of calendar we continue efforts to out license convivia and our preclinical programs 
any of our major programs could be partnered for further development and or could be accelerated  slowed or ceased due to scientific results or challenges in obtaining funding 
we anticipate that we will need additional funding in order to pursue our plans beyond the next months 
in addition  the timing and costs of development of our programs beyond the next months is highly uncertain and difficult to estimate 
see part i  item a of this annual report on form k titled risk factors for further discussion about the risks and uncertainties pertaining to drug development 
interest income interest income increased approximately million for the year ended august  when compared to the prior year due to primarily to higher cash balances from our september million follow on offering and from sales of stock pursuant to our at the market sales agreement 
interest expense interest expense for the years ended august  and was nominal 
foreign currency transaction loss foreign currency transaction gains were approximately million for the year ended august  compared to a nominal transaction loss in the prior year 
the increase was due to more activity conducted in europe in euro in preparation for commercial launch and activities of our subsidiary  the cv  whose functional currency is the euro 
adjustment to the fair value of common stock warrants adjustment to the fair value of common stock warrants was a loss of approximately million for the year ended august  compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended august   a decrease in loss of approximately million resulting primarily from the lower number of remaining warrants outstanding due to warrant exercises  as well as an increase of per share in our common stock price from august  these losses are non cash

adjustment to the fair value of common stock warrants adjustment to the fair value of common stock warrants was a loss of approximately million for the year ended august  compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended august   an increase in loss of approximately million resulting from an increase in our common stock price of per share 
these losses are non cash 
liquidity and capital resources capital resource requirements as of august   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and restricted cash  approximately million in current liabilities of which million represented the non cash common stock warrant liability and approximately million of net working capital 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments as of october  of approximately million will be sufficient to meet our obligations into the third quarter of calendar our recurring losses from operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and  as a result  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended august  with respect to this uncertainty 
we may need to generate significant revenue or sell equity or debt securities to raise additional funds to continue to operate as a going concern beyond the third quarter of calendar in addition  the perception that we may not be able to continue as a going concern may cause others to choose not to deal with us due to concerns about our ability to meet our contractual obligations and may adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital 
the sale of additional equity securities will result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional financing  equity or debt  may not be available when needed in amounts or on terms satisfactory to us or at all 
we may be unable to raise additional financing due to a variety of factors  including our financial condition  the status of our research and development programs  and the general condition of the financial markets 
if we fail to raise additional financing when needed  we may have to delay or terminate some or all of our research and development programs  our financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected and we may have to scale back our operations 
as of october   approximately million shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the series a warrants  approximately million shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the series b warrants  approximately million shares of our common stock have been issued upon exercise of the placement agent warrants  and series a warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares of our common stock were outstanding  all of which warrants were issued pursuant to a definitive securities purchase agreement  dated as of december  the outstanding series a warrants are exercisable until december   at a per share exercise price of 
as of october   approximately million shares of our common stock had been issued upon exercise of the warrants  and warrants to purchase up to approximately million shares including the placement agent warrant described below of our common stock were outstanding  all of which warrants were issued pursuant to private placement purchase agreements  dated as of august   with private placement investors for the private placement of our common stock and warrants 
each warrant  exercisable for years from august   has an exercise price of per share 
the placement agent warrant is the warrant issued to the placement agent for this private placement to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on september   we closed an underwritten public offering of shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the shares sold in the offering included million shares of our common stock plus an additional million shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of the over allotment option we granted to them 
total gross proceeds to us in the offering including in connection with the sale of the shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the over allotment option were million  before underwriting discounts and commissions 
the offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deduction of underwriting discounts of and other offering expenses paid by us 
on april   we entered into a sales agreement with cowen and company  llc  or cowen  to sell shares of our common stock  with aggregate gross sales proceeds of up to  from time to time  through an at the market equity offering program under which cowen acts as sales agent 
we pay a commission to cowen on any sales pursuant to this sales agreement 
as of october   we sold an aggregate of approximately million shares at a weighted average sales price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the funds required for our continued operation 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
if we are not able to obtain financing on a timely basis  we will not be able to meet our obligations as they become due and we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business 
this also may be the case if we become insolvent or if we breach our licensing agreements with ucsd  washington university or yeda  or due to non payment and we do not cure our non payment within the stated cure period 
if this happens  we would lose all the rights to rp and rp licensed to us by ucsd  all rights to mesd licensed to us by washington university and the rights licensed to us by yeda  depending on which agreement is breached 
we will not be able to generate revenues from the sale of products until we obtain regulatory approval for rp  our lead drug product candidate 
revenue generation may require several more months beyond the pdufa date and potential approval  or substantially longer if there are further regulatory requirements and delays 
substantial revenues in addition to cystinosis revenues will depend on further development and regulatory approval of our other drug product candidates which will take several years or more  if we are able to do so at all 
accordingly  our cash flow projections are subject to numerous contingencies and risk factors beyond our control  including successfully developing our drug product candidates  market acceptance of our drug product candidates including critical pricing  competition from well funded competitors  and our ability to manage our expected growth 
it is uncertain that for several years  we will be able to generate internal positive cash flow from the sales of our drug product candidates sufficient to meet all of our operating cash flow and capital expenditure requirements 
there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as the continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further long term financing  the obtaining of regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the successful development of our drug product candidates and related technologies  the successful and sufficient market acceptance of any product offerings that we may introduce and  finally  the achievement of a profitable level of operations 
the issuance of additional equity securities by us is likely to result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders 
obtaining commercial loans  assuming those loans would be available  including on acceptable terms  will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments 
research and development activities we plan to conduct further research and development  to support several clinical trials for rp  improve upon our internal discovery molecules and in licensed technology and continue business development efforts for our preclinical and other clinical stage product candidates in the next months 
we plan to conduct research and development activities by our own laboratory staff and also by engaging contract research organizations  clinical research organizations and contract manufacturing organizations 
we also plan to incur costs for the production of our clinical study drug candidates  rp and rp  for commercial pre approval production of rp for cystinosis  for production of rp for additional clinical trials in cystinosis  clinical and medical advisors  and consulting and collaboration fees 
we anticipate that our research and development costs will increase during the next months primarily due to the build up of inventory of rp for cystinosis prior to marketing approval in anticipation of drug launch and the growth in clinical product requirements for our phase b clinical trial in nash 
general and administrative activities general and administrative costs in the next months will consist primarily of pre commercial and commercial activities in anticipation of the potential approval and launch of rp for cystinosis  of legal  tax and accounting fees  patent legal fees  investor relations expenses  board fees and expenses  insurance  rent and facility support expenses 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase primarily due to the commercial and pre commercial efforts required to prepare for the potential commercial launch of rp for cystinosis in both the us and the eu

new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu   intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts  or asu asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts and requires us to perform step if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment may exist 
asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption was not permitted 
we adopted these standards on september  and have determined that asu had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal period ended august   because there was no requirement to perform step due to our positive carrying amount 
in december  the fasb issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations  or asu asu is an update that addresses diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations if the entity presents comparative financial statements and expands the required disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this standard is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition dates are on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption was permitted 
we adopted these standards on september   however  since there were no business combinations during the fiscal period ended august   asu had no material impact on our financial disclosure 
however  the provision will impact the financial disclosures of any business combinations in the future 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and ifrss  or asu asu is intended to result in convergence between gaap and international financial reporting standards  or ifrs  requirements for measurement of and disclosures about fair value 
the amendments are not expected to have a significant impact on companies applying gaap 
key provisions of the amendment include a prohibition on grouping financial instruments for purposes of determining fair value  except when an entity manages market and credit risks on the basis of the entity s net exposure to the group  an extension of the prohibition against the use of a blockage factor to all fair value measurements that prohibition currently applies only to financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets  and a requirement that for recurring level fair value measurements  entities disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs  a description of the valuation process used and qualitative details about the sensitivity of the measurements 
in addition  for items not carried at fair value but for which fair value is disclosed  entities will be required to disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy that applies to the fair value measurement disclosed

it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this standard was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we early adopted these standards as of august  because asu impacts presentation only  it had no effect on our consolidated financial statements or on our financial condition for the fiscal period ended august  in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  or asu  which permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
because we have only one reporting unit  which has a fair value higher than its carrying amount  adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal period ended august  in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  or asu asu simplifies how entities test indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment and permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  early adoption is permitted

the short term bond fund invests the majority of its assets in high quality securities issued or guaranteed by us government agencies or government sponsored enterprises  and has a historical annual yield of over 
this bond fund pays dividends and provides the net asset value of its assets on a daily basis with daily liquidity 
the change in net asset value is recorded on our statements of comprehensive loss as unrealized gain or loss on short term investments 
we completed an evaluation of our investments and determined that we did not have any other than temporary impairments as of august  our investments are placed in financial institutions with strong credit ratings and management expects full recovery of the carrying amounts 
a hypothetical one percentage point decline in interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of august
