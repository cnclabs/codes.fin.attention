this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  judgment and assumptions 
you should review the risk factors section of this annual report on form k for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
certain abbreviated key terms have the meanings defined elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview heartware is a medical device company that develops and manufactures miniaturized implantable heart pumps  or ventricular assist devices  to treat patients suffering from advanced heart failure 
the heartware ventricular assist system the heartware system  which includes a ventricular assist device vad  or blood pump  patient accessories and surgical tools  is designed to provide circulatory support for patients in the advanced stage of heart failure 
the core of the heartware system is a proprietary continuous flow blood pump  the hvad pump  which is a full output device capable of pumping up to liters of blood per minute 
the heartware system is designed to be implanted adjacent to the heart  avoiding the abdominal surgery generally required to implant similar devices 
in  we received ce marking for the heartware system in the european union and in march we received approval from the therapeutic goods administration in australia allowing for commercial sale and distribution of our device 
in the us  the device is the subject of clinical trials for two indications bridge to transplant and destination therapy 
our device is also available in other countries around the world under special access programs and limited commercial availability 
recent key milestones in the development and commercialization of the heartware system include the following in february  we were notified that a us fda circulatory system devices panel of the medical devices advisory committee will review our pre market approval application for our heartware system for a bridge to transplant indication on april   implanted the heartware system in over patients in  in january  we were named to the revive it study  a study to be completed by the universities of michigan and pittsburgh on the benefits of lvad s in patients with earlier access to the device  approval of the heartware system by the therapeutic goods administration tga in australia for listing on the australian register of therapeutic goods  reimbursement approval in france and belgium of the heartware system  and presentation at the th european association for cardio thoracic surgery of clinical data from our advance bridge to transplant clinical trial and the continued access protocol cap 
the updated data for patients enrolled in either the pivotal trial advance or cap demonstrated a day survival of 
beyond the heartware system  we are also evaluating our next generation device  the mvad pump 
the mvad pump is a development stage miniature ventricular assist device  approximately one third the size of the hvad pump 
the mvad pump is based on the same proprietary impeller suspension technology used in the hvad pump  with its single moving part held in place through a combination of passive magnetic and hydrodynamic forces 
like the hvad pump  the mvad pump is designed to support the heart s full cardiac output  yet also has the capability for partial support 
on september   pre clinical data was presented at the th congress of the international society for rotary blood pumps isrbp  which demonstrated that the mvad pump attained the objectives for system performance  hemocompatability and biocompatibility in good laboratory practice glp animal studies  a precursor to human clinical trials 
we are currently preparing to commence human clinical studies in the mvad pump is designed to be implantable by surgical techniques that are even less invasive than those required to implant the hvad pump 
we began generating revenue from our products in august and have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
we expect our losses to continue as we advance and expand our clinical trial activities in the us  continue to develop commercial markets outside of the us  and expand our research and development into next generation products including the mvad pump 
we have financed our operations primarily through the issuance of convertible notes and the issuance of shares of our common stock 
most recently  on december   we issued convertible notes with an aggregate principal amount of million pursuant to the terms of an indenture dated as of december  the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the convertible notes will mature on december   unless earlier repurchased or converted 
we are headquartered in framingham  massachusetts 
we have operations and manufacturing facilities in miami lakes  florida  a development and operations facility in sydney  australia and a distribution and customer service facility in hannover  germany 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we are required to adopt various accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions in preparing our financial statements that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on our historical experience to the extent practicable and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made 
if our assumptions prove inaccurate or if our future results are not consistent with our historical experience  we may be required to make adjustments in our policies that affect our reported results 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the financial statements included in this report 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition  inventory capitalization and valuation  accounting for share based compensation  measurement of fair value  and the valuation of tax assets and liabilities 
we also have other key accounting policies that are less subjective and  therefore  their application is less subject to variations that would have a material impact on our reported results of operations 
the following is a discussion of our most critical policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with fasb asc revenue recognition 
pursuant to agreements or orders from customers  we ship product to our customers 
revenue from product sales is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to our customers  the selling price is fixed and collection is reasonably assured 
a majority of product sales are initially made on a consignment basis and as such  pursuant to the terms of the consignment arrangements  revenue is recognized on the date the consigned product is implanted or otherwise consumed 
revenue from product sales not sold on a consignment basis is recognized upon customer receipt and acceptance of the product 
revenue recognized to date is from sales of our devices in connection with our us clinical trials and commercial sales in europe and to a lesser extent under special access in other countries 
inventory capitalization we expense costs relating to the production of inventories as research and development r d expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is considered probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
we then begin to capitalize subsequent inventory costs relating to that product 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out  or fifo  method 
work in process and finished goods include direct and indirect labor and manufacturing overhead 
finished goods include product which is ready for use and which is held by us or by our customers on a consignment basis 
we review our inventory for excess or obsolete items and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
obsolescence may occur due to product expiring or product improvements rendering previous versions obsolete 
the extent to which product improvements will cause obsolescence of existing inventory is difficult to determine as the rate of customer acceptance is dependent on many factors 
we make judgments and estimates on matters  including forecasted sales volume 
our estimates and judgments in this area are subject to uncertainty and may differ from our actual experience in the future  which could have a material effect on recorded inventory values 
we include in inventory materials and finished goods that are held for sale 
certain materials and finished goods held in inventory may be used in research and development activities and are expensed as part of research and development costs when consumed 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense in connection with our share based awards  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those awards expected to vest over the service period of the award 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on our historical experience of forfeitures and our employee retention rate 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
calculating share based compensation expense requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions  including estimates of expected life of the share based award  stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and risk free interest rates 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we value restricted stock units  or rsu s  at their intrinsic value on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of our stock options using a black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our stock options represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
when appropriate  we estimate the expected life of a stock option by averaging the contractual term of the stock option up to years with the associated vesting term typically years 
we estimate the volatility of our shares on the date of grant considering several factors  including the historical volatility of our publicly traded shares 
we estimate the risk free interest rate based on rates in effect for united states government bonds with terms similar to the expected lives of the awards  at the time of grant 
we have issued share based awards with performance based vesting criteria 
achievement of the milestones must be probable before we begin recording share based compensation expense 
at each reporting period  we review the likelihood that these awards will vest and if the vesting is deemed probable  we begin to recognize compensation expense at that time 
in the period that achievement of the performance based criteria is deemed probable  us gaap requires the immediate recognition of all previously unrecognized compensation since the original grant date 
as a result  compensation expense recorded in the period that achievement is deemed probable could include a substantial amount of previously unrecorded compensation expense related to the prior periods 
during  and  we determined that achievement of certain performance based vesting criteria for share based awards originally granted in and was probable 
therefore  we began recording compensation expense during  and in connection with certain share based awards that had been outstanding but for which we had not previously recorded any compensation expense 
if ultimately performance goals are not met  for any share based awards where vesting was previously deemed probable  previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
fair value measurements fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
fasb asc requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments  whether or not recognized  for financial statement purposes 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to us as of the respective reporting dates 
accordingly  the estimates presented in our financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments 
fasb asc specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level instruments with primarily unobservable value drivers 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of financial instruments represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  the use of different estimates or assumptions would result in a higher or lower fair value and different amounts being recorded in our financial statements 
calculating fair value utilizing level inputs requires the input of highly subjective judgment and assumptions 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method presented by fasb asc income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fasb asc through december   we have historically concluded that a full valuation allowance is required to offset our net deferred tax assets 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
fasb asc requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
reserves management must make estimates and assumptions to determine the amount of reserves to record in the financial statements 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  our consolidated financial statements could be materially and adversely affected 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from an inability to collect payments owed to us for product sales 
we regularly review the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience  the age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
certain patient accessories sold with the heartware system are covered by a limited warranty ranging from one to two years 
estimated contractual warranty obligations are recorded as an expense when the related revenue is recognized and are included in cost of revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
factors that affect estimated warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims  cost per claim  and vendor supported warranty programs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
results of operations the following is a description of significant components of our operations  including significant trends and uncertainties that we believe are important to an understanding of our business and results of operations 
fiscal years and revenue  net in and  we generated revenue from commercial sales outside of the us and sales in connection with our clinical trials in the us the increase in revenue is primarily due to increased market penetration outside of the us  increased activity in our us destination therapy study and continuing activity after completion of our us bridge to transplant study through a continued access protocol cap 
net revenue for the years ended december  and was as follows september  september  september  change in thousands revenue  net approximately of our product sales in were derived in the us as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the portion of our revenue derived in the us is due primarily to the increased enrollment in our us destination therapy study 
our sales outside of the us are made in multiple currencies  with the majority of our international revenue denominated in the euro 
during  our net international revenue denominated in foreign currencies increased by million  or  compared to the change in exchange rates for all foreign currencies for accounted for approximately million of the increase for the year 
we expect to continue to generate and grow commercial revenue from product sales as we further expand our sales and marketing efforts outside of the united states and continue enrollment of our destination therapy clinical trial  endurance  in the us notwithstanding our plans to generally expand our us clinical programs  revenue from us sources in connection with our trials may vary from quarter to quarter as the recruitment of qualified patients that meet protocol criteria fluctuate  as we approach the enrollment capacity in our approved trials and because additional cap cohorts are subject to fda approval 
future product sales are dependent on many factors  including receiving and maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals in the us and internationally  perception of product performance and market acceptance among physicians  patients  health care payers and the medical community as well as our capacity to meet customer demand by manufacturing sufficient quantities of our products 
cost of revenue cost of revenue includes costs associated with manufacturing and distributing our product and consists of direct materials  labor and overheard expenses allocated to the manufacturing process  provisions for excess or obsolete inventory  and shipping costs 
cost of revenue totaled approximately million for the year ended december  and approximately million for the year ended december  gross profit and gross margin percentage for the years ended december  and were as follows september  september  in thousands gross profit gross margin the gross margin percentage for increased compared to as a result of lower per unit costs in primarily due to increased production volume and improved efficiencies in our manufacturing processes 
in may  we began shipping a sintered version of the heartware system on a global basis 
sintering is a process whereby minute beads are adhered to a titanium surface commonly used in medical devices to facilitate tissue adhesion 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down of million against our existing non sintered inventory to reduce inventory to forecasted marketable levels  leaving a balance of million as of december  this product continues to be implanted at certain customer sites 
a write down of all or a portion of this remaining inventory as obsolete could have a negative impact on our gross profit and gross margin percentage in future periods 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include costs associated with selling and marketing our products and the general corporate administration of the company 
these costs are primarily related to salaries and wages and related employee costs  travel  external consultants and contractors  legal and accounting fees and general infrastructure costs  and include all operating costs not associated with or otherwise classified as research and development costs or cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows september  september  september  change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses of operating expenses during  we continued to experience significant growth as we expanded european sales and distribution capabilities and increased the number of implants in the us under clinical trials 
we also experienced growth in administrative costs as we expanded our administrative capabilities to support overall corporate growth 
as a result  we experienced expansion of our staff  including senior management  and overall growth in selling and marketing and administrative functions and experienced a related expansion in infrastructure costs 
the increase of million was a result of an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of approximately million  primarily due to increased headcount 
we also experienced increases in office expenses of million  travel expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and legal costs of million 
the increase in legal costs includes million for the potential settlement of ongoing litigation as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in compared to as we prepare for the launch of the heartware system in the united states  and continue to expand our sales and distribution capabilities as well as our administrative capabilities to support our overall corporate growth 
we have and will continue to experience an increase in our employee headcount as well as an increase in costs associated with the necessary administrative infrastructure to support this expansion 
research and development research and development expenses are the direct and indirect costs associated with developing our products prior to commercialization and are expensed as incurred 
these expenses fluctuate based on project level activity and consist primarily of salaries and wages and related employee costs of our research and development  clinical and regulatory staff  external research and development costs  and materials and expenses associated with clinical trials 
additional costs include travel  facilities and overhead allocations 
september  september  september  change in thousands total research and development expenses of operating expenses the increase of million was due to an increase in costs associated with development projects  including consumables  animal studies  outside engineering  consultants and contractors  of million  primarily related to mvad development 
we also experienced an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of approximately million and an increase in share based compensation of million 
costs associated with our us clinical trials increased by million 
even with commercial approval of the heartware system in europe  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to represent a significant portion of our operating expenses for the foreseeable future related to clinical trials in the us and new product development  including costs related to the development of the mvad system 
foreign exchange we generate a substantial portion of our revenue and collect receivables in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the euro  british pound and australian dollar can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses that may significantly impact our financial results 
continued fluctuation of these exchange rates could result in financial results that are not comparable from quarter to quarter 
in general  we do not currently utilize foreign currency contracts to mitigate foreign exchange gains and losses 
in  our net foreign exchange losses totaled approximately million compared to million in the increase in our net foreign exchange losses is primarily due to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the euro and us dollar during in and  the majority of our realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were experienced upon the collection of certain accounts receivable that were denominated in foreign currencies  and the translation to us dollars at period end of certain balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the euro 
we expect to continue to realize foreign exchange gains and losses for the foreseeable future as the majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are settled in euros 
interest expense interest expense in consists of interest incurred on the principal amount of our convertible senior notes issued in december  amortization of the related discount and amortization of the portion of the deferred financing costs allocated to the debt component 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
the discount on the convertible senior notes and the deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense through the december  maturity date of the convertible senior notes using the effective interest method 
interest expense was approximately million in interest incurred on the principal amount of the convertible notes at the coupon rate was approximately million and non cash amortization of the discount and deferred financing costs totaled approximately million 
investment income  net investment income is primarily derived from investments and cash and short term deposit accounts held in the us the amortization of premium on our investments is also included in investment income  net 
investment income  net was approximately million in  compared to million in while we had greater cash and investments balances during as a result of the issuance of our convertible senior notes in december  we have experienced lower interest rates in compared to income taxes we are subject to taxation in the united states and jurisdictions outside of the united states 
these jurisdictions have different marginal tax rates 
while we have incurred losses since inception  changes in issued capital and share ownership  as well as other factors  may limit our ability to utilize any net operating loss carry forwards  and as such a valuation allowance has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we did not have revenue or profit which would be sufficient to allow any portion of our deferred tax assets to be recorded 
we intend to monitor closely whether to record a deferred tax asset as we further expand the commercialization of our products 
fiscal years and revenue  net in and  we generated revenue from commercial sales outside of the us and sales in connection with our us clinical trials 
the increase in revenue is primarily due to increased market penetration outside of the us and increased activity in our us bridge to transplant study including sales after completion of the study through a continued access protocol cap 
net revenue for the years ended december  and were as follows september  september  september  change in thousands revenue  net approximately of our product sales in were derived outside of the us as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in the portion of our revenue derived from outside of the united states is due to the continued commercial rollout of the heartware system in europe and other countries with additional implants at existing sites and the addition of new sites 
cost of revenue cost of revenue totaled approximately million for and approximately million for gross profit and gross margin percentage for the years ended december  and were as follows september  september  in thousands gross profit gross margin the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in unit production reducing the overhead and labor costs applied on a per unit basis 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows september  september  september  change in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses of operating expenses during  we experienced significant growth as we expanded european sales and distribution capabilities and increased the number of implants in the us under clinical trials 
we also experienced growth in administrative costs as we continued to manage dual listings of our securities in the united states and australia  raised additional capital and expanded our administrative capabilities to support overall corporate growth 
as a result  we experienced expansion of our staff  including in senior management  and overall growth in selling and marketing and administrative functions and experienced a related expansion in infrastructure costs 
the increase of million in selling  general and administrative costs are primarily a result of an increase in share based payment expense of million  an increase in employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of million  and an increase in travel of million 
in addition  we experienced increases in costs of million related to accounting and tax matters  consultants and contractors of million  office expenses of million  marketing expenses of million and bad debt expense related to the establishment of a reserve for doubtful accounts of million 
increases in costs were partially offset by a decrease in legal fees in as compared to of approximately million associated with a failed merger transaction in the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of operating expenses is due to r d expenses comprising a higher percentage of overall costs as discussed below 
research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december  and were as follows september  september  september  change in thousands total research and development expenses of operating expenses as discussed above  we experienced significant growth in we achieved significant research and development milestones including enrolling a substantial number of patients in our us clinical trial  developing three design configurations for the mvad and furthering animal studies for less invasive implantable techniques related to the mvad 
the increase in research and development expenses  in total and as a percentage of total operating expenses  was primarily a result of increased clinical trial activity  continued development of next generation products  and costs associated with preparing the pma application submission to the fda 
the increase in research and development expenses of approximately million is primarily due to an increase in costs associated with our us clinical trials of million  an increase in costs associated with development projects including outside engineering  consultants and contractors of million related to mvad development and preparation for our pma application for hvad and an increase in headcount and related employee costs  including salaries and wages and related costs  of approximately million 
foreign exchange foreign exchange losses totaled approximately million in the year ended december   as compared to a loss of approximately million in in  the majority of our realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses were experienced upon the collection of certain accounts receivable that were denominated in foreign currencies  and the translation to us dollars of customer accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies at period end  primarily the euro 
in  the majority of our foreign exchange gains and losses were due to re measurement of our cash holdings denominated in us dollars held by our australian subsidiary as a result of movements in the exchange rate between the australian dollar and the us dollar 
during the first half of  we maintained the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in australia  denominated in both australian and us dollars 
however  beginning in the second half of  the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are in us dollars on deposit with banks located in the united states 
interest expense interest expense was approximately million in interest incurred on the principal amount of our convertible senior notes at the coupon rate was approximately million and non cash amortization of the related discount and deferred financing costs totaled approximately million 
interest expense was approximately million in  which consists of interest on the principal amount of certain convertible loans of approximately million and non cash amortization of the related deferred financing costs of approximately million 
interest expense in consists of interest incurred on the principal amount of convertible loans that were drawn down in august and december and amortization of deferred non cash financing costs related to these convertible loans 
interest on the convertible loans was payable at a rate of per annum 
the deferred financing costs were being amortized over the term of the associated loan agreement  which was set to expire no later than november  however  with the repayment of all amounts available to be borrowed under the terms of the loan agreement  we effectively extinguished all debt under this loan agreement 
there was no such interest expense in as the convertible loans were repaid and the loan agreement terminated in the fourth quarter of investment income  net investment income  net was approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to higher cash balances during the period resulting from the capital raises completed in the second half of and in february however  we experienced lower interest rates in compared to change in fair value of derivative instrument as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we recorded the fair value of an embedded derivative instrument on july  related to the australian dollar denominated conversion feature in a loan agreement 
we were required to initially record this derivative at fair value on july  and re measure fair value at each reporting period 
during the year ended december   we recognized aggregate non cash expenses of approximately million due to the increase in the fair value of this derivative between july  and december   the date the derivative was extinguished 
this increase in fair value was primarily due to an increase in the fair value of our common stock and is non cash in nature 
gain on early extinguishment of debt as further discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  in  we recorded a net gain non cash on the early extinguishment of debt 
due to the repayment of all amounts borrowed under the related loan agreement  our inability to re borrow amounts repaid and the lender s inability to convert any repaid amounts into shares of our common stock  the fair value of the derivative instrument at the repayment dates  aggregating approximately million  was recorded as a gain on the extinguishment of debt 
further  the unamortized balance of the deferred financing costs at the repayment dates  aggregating approximately million  was recorded as a reduction of the gain on early extinguishment of debt  resulting in a net gain on the early extinguishment of debt of million for the year ended december  since there are no funds held in escrow  there are no amounts remaining for us to borrow and no amounts remaining for the lender to convert into shares of our common stock 
therefore  the lender s conversion rights  and thus the derivative  were eliminated 
income taxes as of december   we did not have revenue or profit which would be sufficient to allow any portion of our deferred tax assets to be recorded and we have incurred losses since inception 
therefore  a valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were approximately million as compared to million at december  following is a summary of our cash flow activities for the years ended december  and september  september  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash used in operating activities cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included a net loss of approximately million and non cash adjustments to net loss totaling approximately million  which primarily consisted of million of share based compensation  million for the amortization of the discount on our convertible notes and million of depreciation and amortization on long lived assets 
also included in cash used in operating activities in are approximately million for the purchase and manufacture of inventories and million for prepaid expenses 
these amounts were partially offset by net collections of trade accounts receivable of million  an increase in other accrued liabilities of million  an increase in deferred rent of million and an increase in trade accounts payable of million 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  included a net loss of approximately million and non cash adjustments to net loss totaling approximately million  which primarily consisted of million of share based compensation  and million of depreciation and amortization 
also included in cash used in operating activities in is approximately million related to an increase in accounts receivable and million for the purchase and manufacture of inventories offset by cash provided by the increase in other current liabilities of approximately million 
cash used in investing activities in  cash used in investing activities included million for the purchase net of maturities of available for sale securities  million to acquire property  plant and equipment  including the build out of our new manufacturing facility located in miami lakes  florida 
in  cash used in investing activities included million for the purchase of available for sale securities  million to acquire property  plant and equipment and million of cash paid for a security deposit on a new facility lease 
cash provided by financing activities during  cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior notes and an offering of our common stock 
in december  we issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million pursuant to the terms of an indenture dated as of december   and received net cash proceeds of approximately million 
the convertible senior notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company 
the convertible senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the convertible senior notes will mature on december   unless earlier repurchased by the company or converted 
in february  we closed a public offering  under a shelf registration on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission on december   of approximately million shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million 
this amount includes the underwriter s exercise of their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at the offering price in and  we also received approximately million and million  respectively  from the exercise of stock options 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we have incurred operating losses to date and anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses as we expand our sales and marketing capabilities  develop new products and seek regulatory approvals for the heartware system in the us in  cash on hand is expected to primarily be used to fund our ongoing operations  including  expanding our sales and marketing capabilities on a global basis  continuing our endurance clinical trial for destination therapy  enrolling additional patients in our advance trial under a cap  preparing for the launch of the heartware system in the us  continued product development  including first human implants of the mvad pump  regulatory and other compliance functions  including costs related to our pma application  and general working capital 
we expect to experience increased cash requirements for inventory and other working capital requirements to support continued growth 
our convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the million interest payments that were due on june and december  were paid 
based on the outstanding principal amount of our convertible senior notes at december   the semi annual interest payments due on june and december  will be approximately million each 
these amounts are expected to be paid from cash on hand 
we believe cash on hand and investment balances as of december  are sufficient to support our planned operations through because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices and the current economic situation  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to obtain regulatory approvals in the us  fund commercial expansion outside of the us and develop new products 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following commercial acceptance of our products  costs to manufacture our products  expenses required to operate multiple clinical trials  further product research and development for next generation products and peripherals and expanding indications for our products as well as efforts to sustain and maintain incremental improvements to existing products  expanding our sales and marketing capabilities on a global basis  including building a team to support us commercialization should the fda approve our device for marketing in the us  broadening our infrastructure in order to meet the needs of our growing operations  and complying with the requirements related to being a public company in both the united states and australia 
contractual obligations at december   our contractual financial obligations and commitments by due dates were as follows september  september  september  september  september  total less than year years years thereafter in thousands convertible senior notes operating lease obligations purchase obligations other total as of january   we entered into a public  private partnership agreement with the regents of the university of michigan whereby we act as industry sponsor of a study being conducted by the university of michigan cardiovascular center and the university of pittsburgh exploring the potential benefits of vads in patients who will be given earlier access to these devices under a grant awarded from the national heart  lung and blood institute 
in the study  called revive it  researchers will compare whether non transplant eligible patients with heart failure less advanced than that of current vad recipients do better with implanted devices than with current medical therapy 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we have committed to provide financial support up to million over the five year trial period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is currently confined to interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents that are invested in highly liquid money market funds  short term time deposits  short term bank notes and short term commercial paper 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to generate reasonable income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we do not presently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline  which could result in a loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
our convertible notes do not bear interest rate risk as the notes were issued with a fixed interest rate of per annum 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we conduct business in foreign countries 
for us reporting purposes  we translate all assets and liabilities of our non us entities at the period end exchange rate and revenue and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the periods 
the net effect of these translation adjustments is shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a component of stockholders equity 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue and collect receivables in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against major foreign currencies  including the euro  british pound and australian dollar can result in foreign currency exchange gains and losses that may significantly impact our financial results 
these foreign currency transaction and translation gains and losses are presented as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
continued fluctuation of these exchange rates could result in financial results that are not comparable from quarter to quarter 
we do not currently utilize foreign currency contracts to mitigate the gains and losses generated by the re measurement of non functional currency assets and liabilities but do hold cash reserves in currencies in which those reserves are anticipated to be expended
