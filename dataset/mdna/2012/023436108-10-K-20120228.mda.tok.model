item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments 
cms added two new regulations that became effective april  a face to face encounter requirement for home health and hospice services and changes to the home health therapy assessment schedule  which requires additional patient evaluations and certifications 
as a condition for medicare payment  the first new regulation mandates that prior to certifying a patient s eligibility for the home health benefit  the certifying physician must document that he or she  or an allowed non physician practitioner  has had a face to face encounter with the patient 
the encounter must occur in the timeframe of days prior to the start of care or days after the start of care 
documentation regarding these encounters must be present on certifications 
for the hospice face to face encounter requirement  a hospice physician or nurse practitioner must have a face to face encounter with the patient during the day period prior to the th day recertification ie  the third benefit period and each subsequent recertification 
under the second new regulation  cms imposed additional therapy assessment requirements 
an assessment by a professional qualified therapist must take place at least once every days during a therapy patient s course of treatment 
additionally  for those qualified patients that require greater than or therapy visits  a qualified therapist must perform the therapy service required  assess the patient  and measure and document potential effectiveness of additional visits 
this requirement applies to each therapy discipline caring for the patient  and the assessment must be performed by each discipline close to  but no later than  the th and th visits 
these new face to face requirements may increase our costs associated with home health certifications and hospice recertifications  and may also impact utilization of home health and hospice services by medicare beneficiaries 
the new therapy assessment requirement similarly may increase our costs associated with the provision of home health therapy services and affect therapy utilization 
these and other regulations implementing the provisions of the ppaca may similarly increase our costs  decrease our revenues  expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct our business 
ppaca also calls for a number of other changes to be made over time that will likely have a significant impact upon the health care delivery system 
for example  ppaca mandates creation of a home health value based purchasing program  the development of quality measures  and decreases in home health reimbursement rates  including rebasing  as further described in part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments 
in addition  ppaca requires the secretary of health and human services to test different models for delivery of care  some of which will involve home health services 
it also requires the secretary to establish a national pilot program for integrated care for patients with certain conditions  bundling payment for acute hospital care  physician services  outpatient hospital services including emergency department services and post acute care services  which would include home health 
in advance of the national pilot program  the newly created 
table of contents cms innovation center is launching the bundled payments for care improvement initiative designed to encourage doctors  hospitals and other health care providers  including home health providers  to work together to better coordinate care for patients both when they are in the hospital and after they are discharged 
in october cms published final accountable care organization aco regulations establishing a shared savings program to facilitate coordination and cooperation among providers to improve the quality of care for medicare fee for service beneficiaries and reduce unnecessary costs 
ppaca further directs the secretary to conduct a study to evaluate cost and quality of care among efficient home health care centers and specifically focusing on access to care and treating medicare beneficiaries with varying severity levels of illness  and provide a report to congress no later than march  at this time  it is not possible to predict with any certainty how these initiatives will be implemented and what impact they may have on our business 
in addition  various health care reform proposals similar to the federal reforms described above have also emerged at the state level  including in several states which we operate 
moreover  in january  the medicare payment advisory commission voted to recommend to congress it make additional changes to the home health payment system noting that such recommendations may include further payment reductions and or a beneficiary copayment obligation 
we cannot predict with certainty what health care initiatives  if any  will be implemented at the state level  or what the ultimate effect of federal health care reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on us or on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
finally  in addition to impacting our medicare businesses  ppaca may also significantly affect our non medicare businesses 
ppaca makes many changes to the underwriting and marketing practices of private payors 
the resulting economic pressures could prompt these payors to seek to lower their rates of reimbursement for the services we provide 
at this time  it is not possible to estimate what impact ppaca may have on our non medicare businesses 
risks related to our growth strategies we may not succeed in our efforts to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a company focused on bringing home a continuum of care whereby we play a key role in managing our patients age related disease processes from onset through the end of life 
if this strategy is not successful  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
our long term strategy is to evolve from a traditional home health and hospice care company to a company focused on bringing home a continuum of care to better serve the needs of our nation s seniors and diversify our sources of payment so as to become less reliant upon medicare 
to this end  we are working to develop or acquire new business lines that will complement our existing home care and hospice business and help seniors manage their health more effectively and stay in their homes longer 
we are also working to develop or acquire new business lines that are focused on managing our patients age related disease processes from onset through the end of life 
these new business lines will focus on expanding the range of health care services provided within patients homes  including through utilization of house call physician or nurse practitioners and developing technology that assists with coordinating patient care  developing new care transition processes and promoting patient education 
developing or acquiring new lines of business can be time consuming and expensive  and there can be no assurance that our efforts in these areas will ultimately be successful 
further  the development or acquisition of new lines of business requires significant attention from our management team  and if events occur that distract our management s attention and resources  our business performance could be negatively impacted 
in addition  we may expend significant resources to acquire or develop and introduce new business lines that are ultimately not accepted by patients  payors or referral sources for multiple reasons  including  but not limited to  a failure to successfully market the new business lines to patients  payors and referral sources  competition from existing and new competitors and a failure to introduce new business lines in a timely manner 
these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our internal growth strategies depend on our ability to maintain and build upon our market positions in geographic areas where we currently have a significant market presence 
if our internal growth strategies are unsuccessful  or if we are not able to maintain and build upon our market presence in our leading markets  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we have made a decision to emphasize internal growth by maintaining and building upon our market positions in geographic areas where we currently have a significant market presence 
this will likely involve sharing resources among geographically proximate care centers  the continued development and deployment of our specialty programs  continued referral source communication enhancements  opening targeted start up care centers in existing leading markets and entering into relationships or joint ventures with health systems and hospitals 
if these strategies are unsuccessful or if we are unsuccessful in building upon our current leading market positions  this could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
further  in areas where we currently have a significant market presence  partnering or entering into joint ventures with health systems and hospitals is one way to increase that presence 
we face competition for potential partnership and joint venture candidates  which may limit the number of partnership and joint venture opportunities available to us 
further  we may not be able to identify 
table of contents suitable partnership or joint venture opportunities in the future or any such opportunities  if identified  may not be consummated on favorable terms  if at all 
without successful partnerships or joint ventures in markets where we already have a significant market presence  our future growth rates could decline 
in addition  any future partnerships or joint ventures  if consummated  may not be successful in achieving further growth and market penetration 
our external growth strategies depend on our ability to pursue targeted acquisition opportunities 
if such opportunities are not available on favorable terms  or if we are not able to successfully integrate newly acquired care centers into our existing operations  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
as part of our external growth strategies  we will continue to pursue the acquisition of care centers  or assets of care centers  in targeted markets 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify  negotiate and complete suitable acquisition opportunities on favorable terms 
we also face competition for acquisition candidates 
further  pursuing acquisitions could strain our resources  including management  information systems  regulatory compliance  logistics and other controls 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
additionally  acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in recouping partial episode payments and other types of misdirected payments for services from the previous owners  difficulties integrating acquired personnel and business practices into our business  the potential loss of key employees  referral sources or patients of acquired care centers  the delay in payments associated with change in ownership  control and the internal process of the medicare fiscal intermediary  and the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired care centers 
we may not be able to fully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our current business structure in an efficient and cost effective manner 
the failure to effectively integrate any of these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a component of our internal growth strategies is opening targeted start up care centers 
if we are not able to open start up care centers  integrate them into our existing operations and operate them effectively  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
further  start up care centers can be delayed from opening in a timely manner due to processing of regulatory approvals  which delay could impact the success of our growth strategies 
one of our growth strategies is to open care centers in existing and new targeted markets 
however  our ability to open start up care centers will depend on several factors  including our ability to obtain locations for care centers in markets where need exists  identify and hire a sufficient number of appropriately trained professionals  and obtain adequate financing to fund growth 
further  there can be delays associated with opening a start up care center 
these delays are the result of processing delays with the state regulatory bodies as well as processing delays by the associated fiscal intermediaries that serve as billing liaisons between the care center and cms 
in order to initiate operations at a start up care center we must submit the necessary applications along with the required documentation to the appropriate state and federal regulatory bodies 
however  cms has issued a memorandum which prioritizes the initial surveys for new medicare providers as lowest priority for the state regulatory bodies 
moreover  depending on state requirements  the fiscal intermediary may need to receive the state license before the approval process can move forward 
once the necessary application and documentation has been submitted to the state and federal regulatory bodies  there is a testing period of transmitting data from the applicant to cms 
once complete  the care center receives a provider agreement and corresponding number and can begin billing 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for our start up care centers in a timely manner  such delays could impact the success of our growth strategies and could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents state efforts to regulate the establishment or expansion of health care providers could impair our ability to expand our operations 
some states require health care providers including skilled nursing facilities  hospice care centers  home health care centers and assisted living facilities to obtain prior approval  known as a con or poa  in order to commence operations 
see part i  item  our regulatory environment for additional information on cons and poas 
if we are not able to obtain such approvals  our ability to expand our operations could be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
federal regulation may impair our ability to consummate acquisitions or open new care centers 
changes in federal laws or regulations may materially adversely impact our ability to acquire care centers or open new start up care centers 
for example  ppaca authorized cms to impose temporary moratoria on the enrollment of new medicare providers  if deemed necessary to combat fraud  waste or abuse under government programs 
the moratoria on new enrollments may be applied to categories of providers or to specific geographic regions 
if a moratorium is imposed on the enrollment of new home health or hospice providers in a geographic area we desire to service  it could have a material impact on our ability to open new care centers 
additionally  cms recently adopted and amended a regulation known as the month rule that is applicable to home health care center acquisitions 
subject to certain exceptions  the month rule prohibits buyers of certain home health care centers those that either enrolled in medicare or underwent a change in majority ownership fewer than months prior to the acquisition from assuming the medicare billing privileges of the acquired care center 
these changes in federal laws and regulations  and similar future changes  may further increase competition for acquisition targets and could have a material detrimental impact on our acquisition strategy 
risks related to our operations because we are limited in our ability to control rates received for our services  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain or reduce our costs to provide such services 
as medicare is our primary payor and rates are established through federal legislation  we have to manage our costs of providing care to achieve a desired level of profitability 
additionally  non medicare rates are difficult for us to negotiate as such payors are under pressure to reduce their own costs 
as a result  we manage our costs in order to achieve a desired level of profitability including  but not limited to  centralization of various processes  the use of technology and management of the number of employees utilized 
if we are not able to continue to streamline our processes and reduce our costs  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our industry is highly competitive  with few barriers to entry 
there are few barriers to entry in home health markets that do not require a con or poa 
our primary competition comes from local privately owned and hospital owned health care providers 
we compete based on the availability of personnel  the quality of services  expertise of visiting staff  and in certain instances  on the price of our services 
increased competition in the future may limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
further  the introduction of new and enhanced service offerings by others  in combination with industry consolidation and the development of strategic relationships by our competitors  could cause a decline in revenue or loss of market acceptance of our services or make our services less attractive 
additionally  we compete with a number of non profit organizations that can finance acquisitions and capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or receive charitable contributions that are unavailable to us 
managed care organizations and other third party payors continue to consolidate which enhances their ability to influence the delivery of health care services 
consequently  the health care needs of patients in the united states are increasingly served by a smaller number of managed care organizations 
these organizations generally enter into service agreements with a limited number of providers 
our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected if these organizations terminate us as a provider and or engage our competitors as a preferred or exclusive provider 
in addition  should private payors  including managed care payors  seek to negotiate additional discounted fee structures or the assumption by health care providers of all or a portion of the financial risk through prepaid capitation arrangements  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to react competitively to new developments  our operating results may suffer 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our success depends on referrals from physicians  hospitals and other sources in the communities we serve and on our ability to maintain good relationships with existing referral sources 
our referral sources are not contractually obligated to refer patients to us and may refer their patients to other providers 
our growth and profitability depends  in part  on our ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of the benefits of home health and hospice care by our referral sources and their patients 
our loss of  or failure to maintain  existing relationships or our failure to develop new referral relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to provide consistently high quality of care  our business will be adversely impacted 
providing quality patient care is the cornerstone of our business 
hospitals  physicians and other referral sources refer patients to us in large part because of the quality of care we provide 
clinical quality is becoming increasingly important within our industry 
effective october  medicare will impose a financial penalty upon hospitals that have excessive rates of patient readmissions within days from hospital discharge 
we believe this new regulation provides a competitive advantage to home health providers who can differentiate themselves based upon quality  particularly by achieving low patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates and by implementing disease management programs designed to be responsive to the needs of patients served by referring hospitals 
we are focused intently upon improving our patient outcomes  particularly our patient acute care hospitalization readmission rates 
if we should fail to attain our goals regarding acute care hospitalization readmission rates and other quality metrics  we expect our ability to generate referrals would be adversely impacted  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may close additional underperforming care centers in the future 
during and  we reviewed the performance of our portfolio of care centers 
our review considered the current financial performance  market penetration  forecasted market growth and current and future cms payment revisions 
as a result of this review we closed or consolidated a total of care centers and ceased operations at another unopened start up centers 
we incurred exit activity costs of million in connection with these closures  including lease termination payments  relocation costs  severance costs and asset and intangible write offs 
we will continue to monitor the performance of our existing care centers on an ongoing basis and anticipate that additional closures may from time to time occur in the future 
we will incur costs and expenses with any additional closures  which may require us to book significant charges in future periods 
while any such closures would be part of our efforts to improve our profitability  they would have a negative impact on our revenue and possibly our operating results over the short term 
our business depends on our information systems 
our inability to effectively integrate  manage and keep our information systems secure and operational could disrupt our operations 
our business depends on effective  secure and operational information systems which include software that is developed in house and systems provided by external contractors and other service providers 
we have developed and use a proprietary windows based clinical software system with our poc system to collect assessment data  schedule and log patient visits  communicate with patients physicians regarding their plan of care and monitor treatments and outcomes in accordance with established medical standards 
our clinical software system integrates billing and collections functionality  accounting  human resources  payroll  and employee benefits programs provided by third parties 
problems with  or the failure of  our technology and systems or any system upgrades or programming changes associated with such technology and systems that have problems or fail to function properly could have a material adverse effect on data capture  billing  collections  assessment of internal controls and management and reporting capabilities 
any such problems or failures and the costs incurred in correcting any such problems or failures  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
to the extent these external contractors or other service providers become insolvent or fail to support the software or systems we have licensed from them  our operations could be materially adversely affected 
our care centers also depend upon our information systems for accounting  billing  collections  risk management  quality assurance  human resources  payroll and other information 
if we experience a reduction in the performance  reliability  or availability of our information systems  our operations and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be materially adversely affected 
our information systems and applications require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
our acquisition activity requires transitions and integration of various information systems 
we regularly upgrade and expand our information systems capabilities 
if we experience difficulties with the transition and integration of information systems or are unable to implement  maintain  or expand our systems properly  we could suffer from  among other things  operational disruptions  regulatory problems and increases in administrative expenses 

table of contents we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches  including unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information stored in our information systems  and the introduction of computer viruses to our systems 
our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches and our business operations could be materially adversely affected by federal and state fines and penalties  cancellation of contracts and loss of patients if security breaches are not prevented 
we have installed privacy protection systems and devices on our network and poc laptops in an attempt to prevent unauthorized access to information in our database 
however  our technology may fail to adequately secure the confidential health information and personally identifiable information we maintain in our databases 
in such circumstances  we may be held liable to our patients and regulators  which could result in fines  litigation or adverse publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
even if we are not held liable  any resulting negative publicity could harm our business and distract the attention of management 
further  our information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  flood  power loss  telecommunications failure  break ins and similar events 
a failure to restore our information systems after the occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
because of the confidential health information we store and transmit  loss of electronically stored information for any reason could expose us to a risk of regulatory action and litigation and possible liability and loss 
we believe we have all the necessary licenses from third parties to use technology and software that we do not own 
a third party could  however  allege that we are infringing its rights and we may not be able to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms from the third party  if at all  or the third party may commence litigation against us 
in addition  we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to protect our trade secrets  to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the scope and validity of any proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation  or the failure to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights  could materially and adversely affect our business 
possible changes in the case mix of patients  as well as payor mix and payment methodologies  could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our revenue is determined by a number of factors  including our mix of patients and the rates of payment among payors 
changes in the case mix of our patients  payment methodologies or the payor mix among medicare  medicaid and private payors could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
a write off of a significant amount of intangible assets or long lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
during the third and fourth quarter and of  we determined that goodwill and other intangible assets related to our home health reporting unit were impaired and we recorded an estimated non cash goodwill and other intangible assets impairment charge of million for the home health reporting unit 
in addition  a further significant and sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate or slower growth rates could result in the need to perform an impairment analysis under accounting standard codification asc topic intangibles goodwill and other in future periods 
if we were to conclude that a future write down of goodwill is necessary  then we would record the appropriate charge  which could result in material charges that are adverse to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets  net to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impairment 
because we have grown in part through acquisitions  goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets 
goodwill was approximately million as of december  and if we make additional acquisitions  it is likely that we will record additional intangible assets in our consolidated financial statements 
we also have long lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets of million as of december   which we review both on a periodic basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if a determination that a significant impairment in value of our unamortized intangible assets or long lived assets occurs  such determination could require us to write off a substantial portion of our assets 
a write off of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents a shortage of qualified registered nursing staff and other clinicians  such as therapists  could materially impact our ability to attract  train and retain qualified personnel and could increase operating costs 
we compete for qualified personnel with other providers of home health and hospice services 
our ability to attract and retain clinicians depends on several factors  including our ability to provide these personnel with attractive assignments and competitive salaries and benefits 
we cannot be assured we will succeed in any of these areas 
in addition  there are shortages of qualified health care personnel in some of our markets 
as a result  we may face higher costs of attracting clinicians and providing them with attractive benefit packages than we originally anticipated which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  if we expand our operations into geographic areas where health care providers historically have been unionized  or if any of our care center employees become unionized  being subject to a collective bargaining agreement may have a negative impact on our ability to timely and successfully recruit qualified personnel and may increase our operating costs 
generally  if we are unable to attract and retain clinicians  the quality of our services may decline and we could lose patients and referral sources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance liability coverage may not be sufficient for our business needs 
as a result of operating in the home health industry  our business entails an inherent risk of claims  losses and potential lawsuits alleging incidents involving our employees that are likely to occur in a patient s home 
we maintain professional liability insurance to provide coverage to us and our subsidiaries against these risks 
however  we cannot assure you claims will not be made in the future in excess of the limits of our insurance  nor can we assure you that any such claims  if successful and in excess of such limits  will not have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our insurance coverage also includes fire  property damage and general liability with varying limits 
we cannot assure you that the insurance we maintain will satisfy claims made against us or that insurance coverage will continue to be available to us at commercially reasonable rates  in adequate amounts or on satisfactory terms 
any claims made against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could damage our reputation and business 
we may be subject to substantial malpractice or other similar claims 
the services we offer involve an inherent risk of professional liability and related substantial damage awards 
as of january   we had approximately  employees  home health   hospice and  corporate employees 
in addition  we employ direct care workers on a contractual basis to support our existing workforce 
due to the nature of our business  we  through our employees and caregivers who provide services on our behalf  may be the subject of medical malpractice claims 
a court could find these individuals should be considered our agents  and  as a result  we could be held liable for their acts or omissions 
we cannot predict the effect that any claims of this nature  regardless of their ultimate outcome  could have on our business or reputation or on our ability to attract and retain patients and employees 
while we maintain malpractice liability coverage that we believe is appropriate given the nature and breadth of our operations  any claims against us in excess of insurance limits  or multiple claims requiring us to pay deductibles could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to maintain our corporate reputation  our business may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to maintain our corporate reputation  including our reputation for providing quality patient care and for compliance with medicare requirements and the other laws to which we are subject 
adverse publicity surrounding any aspect of our business  including the death or disability of any of our patients due to our failure to provide proper care  or due to any failure on our part to comply with medicare requirements or other laws to which we are subject  could negatively affect our company s overall reputation and the willingness of referral sources to refer patients to us 
we depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
our success depends upon the continued employment of members of our senior management team  including our chairman and chief executive officer  william f 
borne  our president and chief financial officer  ronald a 
laborde  our executive vice president of home health and hospice  jim robinson  our chief medical officer  dr 
michael o 
fleming  our executive vice president of administration human resources and chief information officer  g 
patrick thompson  jr  our chief compliance officer  jeffrey d 
jeter  and our general counsel and secretary  david r 
bucey 
the loss or departure of any one of these executives or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our operations could be impacted by natural disasters 
the occurrence of natural disasters in the markets in which we operate could not only impact the day to day operations of our care centers  but could also disrupt our relationships with patients  employees and referral sources located in the affected areas and  in the case of our corporate office  our ability to provide administrative support services  including billing and collection services 
in addition  any episode of care that is not completed due to the impact of a natural disaster will generally result in lower revenue for the episode 
for example  our corporate office and a number of our care centers are located in the southeastern united states and the gulf coast region  increasing our exposure to hurricanes 
future hurricanes or other natural disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to liquidity delays in payment may cause liquidity problems 
our business is characterized by delays from the time we provide services to the time we receive payment for these services 
if we have difficulty in obtaining documentation  such as physician orders  experience information system problems or experience other issues that arise with medicare or other payors  we may encounter additional delays in our payment cycle 
in addition  timing delays may cause working capital shortages 
working capital management  including prompt and diligent billing and collection  is an important factor in achieving our financial results and maintaining liquidity 
it is possible that documentation support  system problems  medicare or other provider issues or industry trends may extend our collection period  which may materially adversely affect our working capital  and our working capital management procedures may not successfully mitigate this risk 
additionally  our hospice operations may experience payment delays 
we have experienced payment delays when attempting to collect funds from state medicaid programs in certain instances 
delays in receiving payments from these programs may also materially adversely affect our working capital 
the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets and adverse changes in the united states and global economies could impact our ability to access both available and affordable financing  and without such financing  we may be unable to achieve our objectives for strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
the united states and global capital and credit markets have recently experienced extreme volatility and disruption at unprecedented levels 
many financial institutions have recorded significant write downs of asset values and these write downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions  or have increased their rates significantly 
while we intend to finance strategic acquisitions and internal growth with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  we may require sources of capital in addition to those presently available to us 
uncertainty in the capital and credit markets may impact our ability to access capital on terms acceptable to us ie at attractive affordable rates or at all  and this may result in our inability to achieve present objectives for strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
further  in the event we need additional funds  and we are unable to raise the necessary funds on acceptable terms  our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
our indebtedness could impact our financial condition and impair our ability to fulfill other obligations 
as of december   we had total outstanding indebtedness of approximately million  comprised mainly of indebtedness incurred for acquisitions 
our level of indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows and impair our ability to fulfill other obligations in several ways  including it could require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which could reduce the availability of cash flow to fund acquisitions  start ups  working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  it could limit our ability to borrow money or sell stock for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements and other purposes  it could limit our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our industry or business  it could make us more vulnerable to unfavorable economic or business conditions  and it could limit our ability to make acquisitions or take advantage of other business opportunities 
in the event we incur additional indebtedness  the risks described above could increase 

table of contents the agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and our failure to satisfy requirements in these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the agreements governing our indebtedness the debt agreements contain restrictive covenants that require us to comply with or maintain certain financial covenants and ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional debt  redeem or repurchase stock  pay dividends or make other distributions  make certain investments  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  make acquisitions  enter into joint ventures  merge or consolidate  invest in foreign subsidiaries  amend acquisition documents  enter into certain swap agreements  make certain restricted payments  transfer  sell or leaseback assets  and make fundamental changes in our corporate existence and principal business 
in addition  events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with and maintain the financial covenants and ratios 
any failure by us to comply with or maintain all applicable financial covenants and ratios and to comply with all other applicable covenants could result in an event of default with respect to the debt agreements 
if we are unable to obtain a waiver from our lenders in the event of any non compliance  our lenders could accelerate the maturity of any outstanding indebtedness and terminate the commitments to make further extensions of credit including our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
any failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to ownership of our common stock the price of our common stock may be volatile 
the price at which our common stock trades may be volatile 
the stock market from time to time experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that impact the market prices of securities  particularly those of health care companies 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including our operating and financial performance  variances in our quarterly financial results compared to research analyst expectations  the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock  future sales of common stock by the company or large stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur  investor  analyst and media perception of our business and our prospects  developments relating to litigation or governmental investigations  changes or proposed changes in health care laws or regulations or enforcement of these laws and regulations  or announcements relating to these matters  departure of key personnel  changes in the medicare  medicaid and private insurance payment rates for home health and hospice  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  or general economic and stock market conditions 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global select market nasdaq in particular  has experienced price and volume fluctuations that we believe have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of health care provider companies 
these broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
securities class action cases have often been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the activities of short sellers could reduce the price or prevent increases in the price of our common stock 
short sale is defined as the sale of stock by an investor that the investor does not own 
typically  investors who sell short believe the price of the stock will fall  and anticipate selling shares at a higher price than the purchase price at which they will buy the stock 
as of december   investors held a short position of approximately million shares of our common stock which represented of our outstanding common stock 
the anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of our stock by some institutions or individuals who engage in short sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or preferred stock  or the availability of those shares for future sale  could materially impact our stock price and limit our ability to raise capital 
the following table presents information about our outstanding common and preferred stock and our outstanding securities exercisable for or convertible into shares of common stock as of december  common stock outstanding preferred stock outstanding common stock available under omnibus incentive compensation plan stock options outstanding and exercisable non vested stock outstanding non vested stock units outstanding if we were to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or if there was a public perception that substantial sales could occur  the market price of our common stock could decline 
these sales or the perception of substantial future sales may also make it difficult for us to sell common stock in the future to raise capital 
our board of directors may use anti takeover provisions or issue stock to discourage a change of control 
our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to  shares of common stock and  shares of undesignated preferred stock 
our board of directors may cause us to issue additional stock to discourage an attempt to obtain control of our company 
for example  shares of stock could be sold to purchasers who might support our board of directors in a control contest or to dilute the voting or other rights of a person seeking to obtain control 
in addition  our board of directors could cause us to issue preferred stock entitling holders to vote separately on any proposed transaction  convert preferred stock into common stock  demand redemption at a specified price in connection with a change in control  or exercise other rights designed to impede a takeover 
the issuance of additional shares may  among other things  dilute the earnings and equity per share of our common stock and the voting rights of common stockholders 
we have implemented other anti takeover provisions or provisions that could have an anti takeover effect  including advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 
these provisions  and others that our board of directors may adopt hereafter  may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our board of directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us  even if such offers include a substantial premium to the market price of our stock 
therefore  our stockholders may be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control

table of contents health care reform in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of hcera  which amends the ppaca collectively  the health care reform bills 
the health care reform bills make a number of changes to medicare payment rates  including the reinstatement of the home health rural add on  which began on april  expiring january  
the health care reform bills also include a systematic rebasing of the amount centers for medicare and medicaid services cms reimburses for home health services  to be phased in over four years  beginning in we anticipate that many of the provisions of the health care reform bills may be subject to further clarification and modification through the rule making process 
it is uncertain at this time the effect that rebasing will have on our future results of operations or cash flows 
face to face and therapy requirements in november  cms issued a rule which finalized two new regulations under the ppaca which ultimately were implemented april  a face to face encounter requirement for home health and hospice services and changes in the home health therapy assessment schedule 
as a condition for medicare payment  the ppaca mandates that prior to certifying a patient s eligibility for the home health benefit  the certifying physician must document that he or she  or an allowed non physician practitioner  has had a face to face encounter with the patient 
the encounter must occur in the timeframe of days prior to the start of care or days after the start of care 
documentation regarding these encounters must be present on certifications 
the hospice regulation for the implementation of a ppaca provision requires that a hospice physician or nurse practitioner have a face to face encounter with hospice patients during the day period prior to the th day recertification third benefit period and each subsequent recertification  and that the certifying hospice physician attest that such a visit took place 
in addition  the rule imposed additional home health therapy assessment requirements 
an assessment by a professional qualified therapist must take place at least once every days during a therapy patient s course of treatment 
additionally  for those qualified patients that require or therapy visits  a qualified therapist must perform the therapy service required  assess the patient  and measure and document the potential effectiveness of additional therapy visits 
this requirement applies to each therapy discipline caring for the patient and the assessment must be performed by each discipline close to  but no later than  the th and th visits 
payment on october   cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health rates for calendar year the final rule includes a market basket increase which includes the reduction mandated by the health care reform bills and a negative nominal change in case mix adjustment 
the net effect of these changes decreases the base rate by to  based on our fourth quarter revenues  the decrease in the base rate would reduce home health revenue by approximately million 
the final rule also shifts case mix points from high case mix and high therapy episodes to low case mix and non therapy episodes 
the shift from high therapy episodes will also negatively impact our revenues in in addition to the base rate decrease 
the reduction will be dependent upon our therapy mix at the time the new rule is effective 
in addition  the final rule states that the medicare home health rates for calendar year will include an additional negative nominal change in case mix adjustment 
in august  cms issued a final rule to update and revise the medicare hospice wage index for fiscal year the final rule includes a market basket update  a increase for the updated wage index data and the third year of the year phase out of the budget neutrality adjustment factor of 
the net effect of the final rule  effective october   increases the base rate for by 
based on our revenues  the increase in the base rate would increase hospice revenue by approximately million 
the failure of the joint select committee to meet its deficit reduction goal will result in an automatic reduction to medicare home health and hospice payments of in these cuts in addition to the discussed above will go into effect unless a new law is enacted that specifically addresses these cuts 
in july  cms issued a proposed rule that revised the medicaid home health definition to add a requirement  similar to the finalized medicare home health requirement  that a physician or non physician practitioner perform a face to face encounter with the medicaid eligible individual and the physician must document that the face to face encounter occurred 
under the proposed rule  the face to face encounter must occur no more than days prior to the start of services under the medicaid home health benefit or  in certain circumstances  within days after the start of home health services 
cms has not issued a final rule as of the date of this filing

table of contents net service revenue our home health revenue is driven by the volume of admissions and recertifications and the revenue per episode on episodes completed and in progress 
during  we experienced significant declines in all of these revenue metrics which contributed to a million decline in our home health net service revenue excluding the million for the settlement of our georgia indigent care liability we recognized during approximately million of the decline in revenue is due to the cms rate cut for and approximately million is related to the cms rate cut on our episodes in progress at december  we experienced a decline in episodic based admissions and recertifications during  which accounted for approximately million of the decline in same store episodic based revenue and million of the decline in total episodic based revenue 
we believe our admission volumes were negatively impacted by the cms face to face requirements 
while we cannot fully measure the impact of lower admissions due to the unwillingness of physicians to refer to home health as a result of this regulation  we do believe that it has impacted current admissions and it could impact future admissions 
while our episodic recertifications as a percentage of completed episodes decreased less than  we experienced a decline in same store episodic based recertifications 
the primary reason for the decrease is the overall decline in our patient census driven by the decline in admission volumes 
our revenue per episode decline of has resulted in approximately a million decrease in revenue with approximately million as a result of the cms rate cut for with the remainder due to a reduction in therapy utilization and the impact of the new cms therapy assessment regulations effective april  we performed approximately  therapy visits which became non billable due to our failure to meet the requirements of the regulation resulting in an estimated million reduction in revenue for this regulation was in effect for three quarters of  but will be in effect for all of we expect this regulation to continue to have a negative impact in  however  we expect continued improvement in our management of this regulation through continued training  process improvement and system enhancements 
cost of service  excluding depreciation and amortization the decrease in cost of service is due to the decline in visit volume which corresponds to our decline in admission and recertification volume in and a decrease in our cost per visit 
we performed approximately  fewer visits in  which accounted for million of the decrease 
the remainder is due to the decline in cost per visit which is due primarily to our conversion of therapists to our pay per visit models  our focus on productivity and a decline in therapy visits 
the factors that are expected to impact our cost per visit metric are wage inflation and any change in our mix of visits 
other operating expenses our other operating expenses  excluding the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge decreased million primarily as a result of reductions in salaries and benefits  rent and bad debt expense 
a significant portion of the reduction is due to the consolidation of operating care centers during

other operating expenses our other operating expenses increased million from primarily due to a million increase in salaries and benefits and a million increase in lease expense  which is inclusive of million related to care centers we consolidated in the increase in salaries and benefits is attributable to the increase in net service revenue as we have seen significant growth in our average daily census  which required additional administrative resources

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice care centers by providing a variety of services almost exclusively in the homes of our patients 
this net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis  on a per visit basis or on a daily basis depending upon the payment terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided 
we refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a day episode of care as episodic based revenue 
when we record our service revenue  we record it net of estimated revenue adjustments and contractual adjustments to reflect amounts we estimate to be realizable for services provided  as discussed below 
we believe  based on information currently available to us and based on our judgment  that changes to one or more factors that impact the accounting estimates such as our estimates related to revenue adjustments  contractual adjustments and episodes in progress we make in determining net service revenue  which changes are likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or our future financial results 
home health revenue recognition medicare revenue 
table of contents net service revenue is recorded under the medicare prospective payment system pps based on a day episode payment rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables including  but not limited to a an outlier payment if our patient s care was unusually costly capped at of total reimbursement per provider number  b a low utilization payment adjustment lupa if the number of visits was fewer than five  c a partial payment if our patient transferred to another provider or we received a patient from another provider before completing the episode  d a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required with various incremental adjustments made for additional visits  with larger payment increases associated with the sixth  fourteenth and twentieth visit thresholds  e the number of episodes of care provided to a patient  regardless of whether the same home health provider provided care for the entire series of episodes  f changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  g adjustments to the base episode payments for case mix and geographic wages  and h recoveries of overpayments 
in addition to the items noted above  cms added two new regulations to pps that became effective april  a face to face encounter requirement  and changes to the therapy assessment schedule  which require additional patient evaluations and certifications 
as a condition for medicare payment  the first new regulation mandates that prior to certifying a patient s eligibility for the home health benefit  the certifying physician must document that he or she  or an allowed non physician practitioner  has had a face to face encounter with the patient 
the encounter must occur in the timeframe of days prior to the start of care or days after the start of care 
documentation regarding these encounters must be present on certifications 
under the second new regulation  cms imposed additional therapy assessment requirements 
an assessment by a professional qualified therapist must take place at least once every days during a therapy patient s course of treatment 
additionally  for those qualified patients that require greater than or therapy visits  a qualified therapist must perform the therapy service required  assess the patient  and measure and document potential effectiveness of additional visits 
this requirement applies to each therapy discipline caring for the patient  and the assessment must be performed by each discipline close to  but no later than  the th and th visits 
management evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments as a result of these regulations and  when appropriate  provides allowances based upon the best available information 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of such adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over on medicare claims  and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable 
in addition  management evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments and  when appropriate  provides allowances based upon the best available information 
therefore  we believe that our reported net service revenue and patient accounts receivable will be the net amounts to be realized from medicare for services rendered 
in addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes  we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress 
episodes in progress are day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period  but were not completed as of the end of the period 
we estimate this revenue on a monthly basis based upon historical trends 
the primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period  expected medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on visits performed 
as of december  and  the difference between the cash received from medicare for a request for anticipated payment rap on episodes in progress and the associated estimated revenue was immaterial and  therefore  the resulting credits were recorded as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets for such periods 
non medicare revenue episodic based revenue 
we recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize medicare revenue for episodic based rates that are paid by other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  however  these rates can vary based upon the negotiated terms 
non episodic based revenue 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and are also recorded as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
in addition  we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment 
hospice revenue recognition hospice medicare revenue 
table of contents gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates 
the estimated payment rates are daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver 
the four main levels of care we provide are routine care  general inpatient care  continuous home care and respite care 
routine care accounts for  and of our total net medicare hospice service revenue for the  and  respectively 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of these adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes our historical collection rate on medicare claims  and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
additionally  as medicare hospice revenue is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap for each provider number  we monitor these caps and estimate amounts due back to medicare if a cap has been exceeded 
we record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and an increase in other accrued liabilities 
we have settled our medicare hospice reimbursements for all fiscal years through october  for the cap years ended october  through october   we have million recorded for estimated amounts due back to medicare in other accrued liabilities as of december  for the cap years ended october  and  we have million recorded for estimated amounts due back to medicare in other accrued liabilities as of december  as a result of our adjustments  we believe our revenue and patients accounts receivable are recorded at amounts that will be ultimately realized 
effective april   cms implemented its hospice regulation requiring that a hospice physician or nurse practitioner have a face to face encounter with hospice patients during the day period prior to the th day recertification third benefit period and each subsequent recertification  to gather clinical findings to determine continued eligibility for hospice care  and that the certifying hospice physician or nurse practitioner attest that such a visit took place 
management evaluates the potential for revenue adjustments due to these regulations and when appropriate provides allowances based upon the best available information 
hospice non medicare revenue we record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be realizable from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue and patient accounts receivable 
patient accounts receivable our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and consist of amounts due from medicare  medicaid  other third party payors and patients 
there is no single payor  other than medicare  that accounts for more than of our total outstanding patient receivables  and thus we believe there are no other significant concentrations of receivables that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable 
we fully reserve for accounts which are aged at days or greater 
we write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be uncollectible 
we believe the credit risk associated with our medicare accounts  which represent and of our net patient accounts receivable at december  and  respectively  is limited due to i our historical collection rate of over from medicare and ii the fact that medicare is a us government payor 
accordingly  we do not record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our medicare patient accounts receivable  which are recorded at their net realizable value after recording estimated revenue adjustments as discussed above 
during  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in estimated revenue adjustments to medicare revenue  respectively 
we believe there is a certain level of credit risk associated with non medicare payors 
to provide for our non medicare patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value 
medicare home health for our home health patients  our pre billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from medicare for the services that we provide to our patients 
our medicare billing begins with a process to ensure that our billings are accurate through the utilization of an electronic medicare claim review 
we submit a rap for of our estimated payment for the initial episode at the start of care or of the estimated payment for any subsequent episodes of care contiguous with the first episode for a particular patient 
the full amount of the episode is billed after the episode has been completed final billed 
the rap received for that particular episode is then deducted from our final payment 
if a final bill is not submitted within the greater of days from the start of the episode  or days from the date the rap was paid  any raps received for that episode will be recouped by medicare from any other claims in process for that particular provider number 
the rap and final claim must then be re submitted 

table of contents medicare hospice for our hospice patients  our pre billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from medicare for the services that we provide to our patients 
once each patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will bill medicare on a monthly basis for the services provided to the patient 
non medicare home health and hospice for our non medicare patients  our pre billing process primarily begins with verifying a patient s eligibility for services with the applicable payor 
once the patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will provide services to the patient and bill the applicable payor 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of the receivables to the amounts we estimate will be ultimately collected 
our review and evaluation of non medicare accounts receivable includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or groups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk 
in addition  the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in payment and an evaluation of collectibility based upon the date that the service was provided 
based upon our best judgment  we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected due to credit risk 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability 
while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an annual impairment test 
tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
these events or circumstances include but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in the business environment  regulatory environment or legal factors  or a substantial decline in market capitalization of our stock 
to determine whether goodwill is impaired  we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step of the test  the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would proceed to step two of the test 
in step two of the test  the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess  if any  of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance 
we calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows as well as a market approach that compares our reporting units earnings and revenue multiples to those of comparable public companies 
to determine fair value we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors 
significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations  in particular expected organic growth rates  future medicare reimbursement rates  capital requirements and income taxes  long term growth rates for determining terminal value  and discount rates 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could result in additional impairment in future periods 

table of contents during the third quarter of  indicators of potential impairment caused us to conduct an interim impairment test for goodwill and other intangible assets 
the interim goodwill impairment test was finalized during the fourth quarter of we completed our interim impairment test of goodwill as of october  and recognized the following during the fiscal year a non cash impairment charge of million  a non cash other intangible impairment charge of million  and a deferred tax benefit of million 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets  net for additional information regarding our interim and annual impairment tests 
intangible assets consist of certificates of need  licenses  acquired names  non compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights 
we amortize non compete agreements  acquired names that we do not intend to use in the future and reacquired franchise rights on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which is generally three years for non compete agreements and up to five years for reacquired franchise rights and acquired names 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december  our net deferred tax asset was million and as of our net deferred tax liability was million 
we recorded a tax benefit of million related to the million estimated goodwill and other intangibles impairment charge recorded in the current quarter 
the difference between the benefit recorded and the statutory rate of is due to allocating the impairment of goodwill between deductible and non deductible goodwill for tax purposes 
management regularly assesses the ability to realize deferred tax assets recorded in the company s entities based upon the weight of available evidence  including such factors as the recent earnings history and expected future taxable income 
during  we released a valuation allowance on specific deferred tax assets after we had undertaken tax planning which will allow for the utilization of state net operating losses which may have otherwise expired 
as a result  the income tax provision and the net loss attributable to amedisys  inc for included a one time favorable impact of million 
in the event future taxable income is below management s estimates or is generated in tax jurisdictions different than projected  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
this would result in an increase in our effective tax rate 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income requiring entities to present net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements of net income and other comprehensive income 
the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity is eliminated 
the asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
this allows companies to continue reporting reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income as required before asu asu is effective as of the same date that asu is adopted 
in july  the fasb ratified the final emerging issues task force consensus on issue no 
h  health care entities presentation and disclosure of net revenue  provision for bad debts  and the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the consensus will require health care entities to separately present bad debt expense related to patient service revenue as a reduction to patient service revenue net of contractual allowances and discounts 
health care entities will be required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts  and their policies for assessing collectability in determining the timing and amount of revenue and bad debt expense 
the consensus will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   with early application permitted 
retrospective application will be required for presenting bad debt expense related to patient service revenue as a reduction of revenue 
the expanded disclosures are required to be applied prospectively 
we expect the adoption of this final consensus to decrease our net service revenue by the amount of the provision for doubtful accounts recorded  which will decrease gross margin  however  it will have no effect on net income 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic allowing an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the traditional two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of impairment loss to be recognized if any 
if  after performing 
table of contents the qualitative assessment  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then no further impairment testing is necessary 
otherwise  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
the qualitative assessment includes assessing relevant events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  overall financial performance  relevant entity specific events  events affecting a reporting unit or a sustained decrease in share price 
the asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
our revolving credit facility and term loan carry a floating interest rate which is tied to the eurodollar rate ie libor and the prime rate and therefore  our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately million annually
