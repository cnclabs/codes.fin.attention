item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts introduction the company s overall financial results continued to improve significantly in comparison to and the company s net income available to common shareholders was  compared to  in  or slightly more than a percent increase 
on a per common share basis  we improved to from 
these improvements were the results of a decline in the provision for loan losses due to the overall improved credit quality in our loan portfolio and the related lower level of nonperforming assets 
the provision for loan losses was compared to  in net interest income in was  compared to  in  or approximately a percent decrease  while noninterest income including securities gains and losses declined to  from  our loan portfolio declined to  from  at the end of deposits were slightly lower at the end of compared to year end   from  we earned percent on average assets in compared to percent in the return on equity increased during to percent from percent in our efficiency ratio increased to percent from percent in  where the lower ratio is better 
in  we paid our common shareholders  cents per common share in dividends compared to cents per common share in we had three major goals for and accomplished them all 
first  by substantially improving our credit quality  we were able  on june   to be relieved from the april memorandum of understanding with the iowa division of banking and the fdic 
in addition  all capital and dividend restrictions were released by the federal reserve bank of chicago shortly thereafter 
we are currently not subject to any extraordinary regulatory requirements 
we also achieved another of our major goals for when we repurchased all  of the preferred stock and the warrant the company sold to the us department of the treasury under the capital purchase program 
this was accomplished by using retained earnings and without selling any additional securities or borrowing any additional funds 
we thereby eliminated the requirement to pay preferred stock dividends  which improves net income available to common shareholders 
finally  we accomplished our third major goal when we reinstated and maintained regular quarterly cash dividends 
after a special dividend of cents per common share paid in december  we paid quarterly dividends of cents per common share in may and august and cents per common share in november 
we paid an cent per common share dividend in february in addition to accomplishing our major financial goals for  we continued making substantial investments to improve our credit processes so that our credit quality remains high going forward 
these infrastructure investments are also designed to strengthen our foundation for future growth 
we have created separation between our sales and credit functions 
this allows our highly trained sales force to be focused on generating revenue and relationship building 
building relationships includes both expanding business with current customers and gaining new customers 
as the economic recovery continues  we want to be well positioned to take advantage of additional business opportunities 
the credit function is focused on the underwriting and documentation of the new business opportunities 
we now have additional specialized expertise available to perform these important functions 
the credit function in part also overlaps with our regulatory compliance requirements 
additional resources have also been added to the compliance area to properly handle the unprecedented volume of new regulations applicable to the operations of both the company and west bank 
while we had hoped that our loan portfolio would grow during  we are not completely surprised or disappointed that it contracted somewhat 
the loan portfolio has declined percent since the end of this has occurred for two primary reasons 
first  there were loans in the portfolio that simply could not survive the real estate market collapse and the substantial general downturn in the economy or were loans that we simply no longer wished to own 
we believe the portfolio is largely rid of those loans 
second  a material number of our loan customers have been substantially deleveraging during the last three years 
they have been paying off debt where they could while waiting for better or less risky opportunities for their businesses 
we believe this phenomenon may be starting to change back to a more normal situation  but we cannot precisely predict when or by how much our loan portfolio will start to grow due to existing customer demand 
overall  we believe that our loan portfolio has contracted about as much as it will during this business downturn 
we have had opportunities to transition loans from some of our competitors who have had to contract or otherwise have created uncertainty in the minds of their customers 
we are pursuing more of those opportunities in we plan to grow our loan portfolio in 
table of contents the total amount of our deposit balances has remained fairly similar during the last several years except for the planned transfer of approximately  of smartypig savings account balances in july that transfer was requested by west bank 
the composition of the deposits has  however  changed in a way that may affect west bank in the future 
the amount of time certificates declined from  at the end of to  at the end of we believe that this decline is due in material part to depositors unwillingness to commit to maturity products in this low rate environment 
during the same time period total balances in non maturity deposits increased  excluding smartypig savings accounts 
when competitive interests rates increase or alternative investments begin to be perceived as more favorable by our depositors  we may lose some of the non maturity deposits due to their inherent mobility 
alternatively  if we choose to try to retain a substantial part of these deposits  we may have to raise deposit rates quickly 
we have strong capital resources 
our stock value has increased nicely during the last year  our existing capital is high  and our earnings are solid albeit muted by the economy 
we are building infrastructure that can service additional opportunities 
we have been presented with potential merger or acquisition opportunities during the last year 
none yet have fit our objectives  however  as acquisitions are not a high priority 
nevertheless  we remain attentive to possible transactions 
we understand the things that are required to be a great community bank for our customers and shareholders 
our core corporate values and goals are defined by that understanding 
we are rewriting position descriptions  performance appraisals  and incentive programs to align with what we believe are the reasons people should choose to do business with west bank 
our team is focused on being a great community bank 
looking forward  we have begun a program of quantitative peer analysis for evaluating company results 
we have identified a set of sixteen publicly traded peer financial institutions against which we will compare our future performances 
our goal is to perform at or near the top of those peers relative to what we consider to be four key metrics return on equity  return on assets  texas ratio  and efficiency ratio 
we believe these measures encompass the factors that define the performance of a community bank 
from the political  regulatory  and economic perspectives  we expect will be a year of continued uncertainty and somewhat muted opportunities 
we expect the unusually low interest rate environment to continue 
we anticipate the company will be profitable in at a level that compares favorably with our peers  but which will probably not be totally in line with our high aspirations 
the amount of our future profit will depend  in large part  on the amount of loan losses we incur and our ability to grow the loan portfolio 
our loan portfolio still presents somewhat higher than normal risks because it contains a significant amount of loans secured by commercial real estate 
while we believe we have aggressively addressed declining real estate valuation issues when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future changes in real estate valuations in and beyond remain uncertain 
the following discussion describes the consolidated operations of the company  including west bank  west bank s wholly owned subsidiary wb funding corporation which owns an interest in smartypig  llc  and west bank s percent owned subsidiary icd iv  llc a community development entity and the company s financial condition as of december  the accounts of former subsidiary wb capital management inc wb capital are included in the accompanying financial statements as discontinued operations for all periods through the sale date of december  critical accounting policies this report is based on the company s audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained in these statements is based on the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
however  the preparation of these statements requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on its consideration of accounting policies that involve the most complex and subjective estimates and judgments  management has identified its most critical accounting policies to be those related to asset impairment judgments  including fair value and other than temporary impairment otti of available for sale investment securities  the valuation of other real estate owned  and the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents securities available for sale are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of deferred income taxes 
the company evaluates each of its investment securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to determine whether the decline in fair value is otti 
the investment portfolio is evaluated for otti by segregating the portfolio into two segments and applying the appropriate otti model 
investment securities classified as available for sale are generally evaluated for otti under fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities 
however  certain purchased beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  including asset backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  that had credit ratings of below aa at the time of purchase are evaluated using the model outlined in fasb asc  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
in determining otti under the fasb asc model  the review takes into consideration the severity and duration of the decline in fair value  the length of time expected for recovery  the financial condition of the issuer  and other qualitative factors  as well as the company s lack of intent to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not the company will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
under the fasb asc model  for the second segment of the portfolio  the company compares the present value of the remaining cash flows as estimated at the preceding evaluation date to the current expected remaining cash flows 
an otti is deemed to have occurred if there has been an adverse change in the remaining expected future cash flows 
when otti occurs under either model  the amount of the otti recognized in earnings depends on whether the company intends to sell the security or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if the company intends to sell or it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell before recovery of its amortized cost basis  the otti is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors 
the amount of the total otti related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected  using the original yield as the discount rate  and is recognized in earnings 
the amount of the total otti related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income loss  net of applicable taxes 
the previous amortized cost basis less the otti recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment 
the assessment of whether an otti exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the time 
other real estate owned includes real estate properties acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure 
properties are initially recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs 
after foreclosure  valuations are performed by management at least annually by obtaining updated appraisals or other market information 
any subsequent write downs are recorded as a charge to operations 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collectability of the principal is unlikely 
the company has policies and procedures for evaluating the overall credit quality of its loan portfolio  including timely identification of potential problem loans 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses  incorporating a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative 
quantitative factors include the company s historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  known information about individual loans  and other factors 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in the company s market areas and the expected trend of those economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions or the other factors relied upon 
to the extent actual results differ from forecasts and management s judgment  the allowance for loan losses may be greater or less than future charge offs 
results of operations compared to overview total net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december   was  compared to  for the year ended december  the company s return on average equity roe was percent compared to percent in the return on average assets roa was percent  compared to percent for the prior year 
net income from continuing operations was  for compared to  for basic and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations were and for the same periods  respectively 
the improvement in net income from continuing operations in compared to was due to the  decline in the provision for loan losses 
the provision declined due to the combination of lower outstanding loan balances  improving net charge off experience  and improving credit quality 

table of contents noninterest income  exclusive of securities gains losses  declined by  compared to noninterest income for included  of service fees paid to west bank by smartypig  llc 
this fee was discontinued in the third quarter of after the smartypig savings deposits were transferred to a larger financial institution  therefore no such fees were included in noninterest income for noninterest expense increased by  over primarily due to higher salary and benefits and other real estate owned expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a substantial reduction in fdic insurance expense 
the company has consistently used the efficiency ratio as one of its key financial metrics to measure expense control 
for the year ended december   the company s efficiency ratio increased slightly to percent from the prior year s ratio of percent 
this ratio is computed by dividing noninterest expense excluding goodwill impairment  discontinued operations  and other real estate owned expense by the sum of tax equivalent net interest income plus noninterest income excluding securities gains and net impairment losses and discontinued operations 
the ratio for both years is significantly better than peer group averages  which are generally around percent according to data in the september bank holding company performance report  a report prepared by the federal reserve board s division of banking supervision and regulation 
net interest income net interest income declined to  for as the impact of a percent decline in average earning assets exceeded the savings from lower rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the net interest margin improved to percent from percent in the average yield on earning assets increased basis points primarily due to the  reduction in average federal funds sold and other short term investments  while the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined basis points 
the net interest spread  which is the difference between the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities  improved to percent from percent a year earlier 
for additional details on changes in interest rates and yields and volume variances  see the section of this report entitled  distribution of assets  liabilities and stockholders equity  interest rates  and interest differential 
loan volume loan quality total loans declined  to  as of december   from  a year earlier 
following growth during the second and third quarters  loans outstanding declined approximately  during fourth quarter this was attributable to the unexpected payoff of three large commercial loans 
management believes the loan portfolio will grow during as the pipeline for new loans is improving and the company is focused on attracting new customers and expanding relationships with existing customers 
nonperforming loans at december   totaled  or percent of total loans 
at december   nonperforming loans totaled  or percent of total loans 
nonperforming loans include loans on nonaccrual status  loans past due days or more  and loans that have been restructured due to the borrowers experiencing financial difficulties 
in addition  at december   the company held  of other real estate owned 
the company s burden ratio was percent as of december   compared to percent as of december  the burden ratio is calculated by dividing total nonperforming assets by tangible capital plus the allowance for loan losses 
the ratio for both years is significantly better than peer group averages  which were percent according to data in the september bank holding company performance report 
for more discussion on loan quality  see the loan portfolio and summary of the allowance for loan losses sections of this report 
the allowance for loan losses  which totaled  as of december   represented percent of total loans and percent of nonperforming loans at year end  compared to percent and percent as of december  the provision for loan losses totaled for  down from  for the company s net charge offs as a percent of average loans were percent for  compared to percent for the amount of loans charged off in totaled  compared to  in recoveries in from loans previously charged off were  up from in the prior year 
the recoveries included one commercial recovery of  as the result of the sale of a loan which had been charged off in a prior year 
management believes the allowance for loan losses at december   is sufficient to absorb probable loan losses within the portfolio 

table of contents noninterest income the following table shows the variance from the prior year in the noninterest income categories shown in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  accounts within the other income category that represent significant variances are shown 
years ended december noninterest income change change service charges on deposit accounts debit card usage fees service fee from smartypig  llc trust services gains and fees on sales of residential mortgages increase in cash value of bank owned life insurance gain from bank owned life insurance other income letter of credit fees gain from sales of other assets all other income total other income total noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts declined due to a reduction in overdraft and return check charges 
debit card usage fees continued to show positive growth in as customers with reward me checking and other checking products continued to expand the use of this convenient payment method 
we expect these fees to decline in the future due to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the federal reserve final rule which sets a cap on interchange fees at a rate below the market driven levels 
while financial institutions with less than ten billion dollars in assets are exempt from the cap  industry groups believe the price controls will have a negative impact on community banks over time 
the service fee from smartypig  llc was established to compensate west bank for maintaining the rate paid on the smartypig savings deposits higher than that of other internet based savings accounts 
this fee was discontinued in the third quarter of when these deposits were transferred to another bank 
the volume of originations of residential mortgages sold into the secondary market during declined approximately percent compared to  while revenue declined by only percent 
the volume of originations was strong in the third and fourth quarter as the volume of refinancing picked up as residential mortgage interest rates declined to historic low levels

those losses consisted of a otti on one single issuer tps issued by old second bancorp  inc old second in the second quarter and a credit loss on a pooled tps during the third quarter 
upon the withdrawal of an exchange offer for old second  management decided to eliminate the potential for a total loss on this security and sold it for a loss of during the third quarter 
offsetting this realized loss were gains on sales of municipal and other securities with total net gains of recognized for the year

interest income on loans includes amortization of loan fees and costs  which are not material 

table of contents net interest income the company s largest component of net income is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on earning assets  consisting primarily of loans and investments  and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting of deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in net interest income can result from the combination of changes in the balances of asset and liability categories and changes in interest rates 
interest rates earned and paid are also affected by general economic conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  and by competitive factors  government policies  and the action of regulatory authorities 
net interest margin for the year is a measure of the net return on interest earning assets and is computed by dividing tax equivalent net interest income by the average of total interest earning assets for the year 
for the years ended december    and  the company s net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was   and percent  respectively 
the increase in the net interest margin in was the result of rates paid on deposits and borrowings declining more than the yields on loans and investment securities 
this was partially the result of transferring the smartypig savings deposits to another financial institution in and a continued reduction in market interest rates for deposits throughout rate and volume analysis the rate and volume analysis shown below  on a tax equivalent basis  is used to determine how much of the change in interest income or expense is the result of a change in volume or a change in interest yield or rate

loan pricing in the company s market areas remains competitive  while the demand for new loans began to grow in the second quarter of the average balance of investment securities in fell  compared to  while the yield declined basis points 
the volume declined due to maturities  paydowns on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities  and calls related to refinancings in the low interest rate environment

the average balance of federal funds sold and other short term investments declined  during  and is the primary reason the yield on total interest earning assets increased basis points compared to west bank s goal for is to further manage the average balance of federal funds sold to lower levels while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity 
the average rate paid on deposits declined to percent from percent for the continuing reduction in market rates paid  and the reduction in certificates of deposit by allowing wholesale deposits to mature without renewal during caused interest expense to decline by  certificates of deposit also declined because some customers are unwilling to lock in low interest rates for an extended period of time 
the average rate paid on other borrowings declined basis points to percent 
the effective rate on the outstanding subordinated notes declined basis points as those notes became variable on october  the rate as of december   was percent  which was approximately half of the former fixed rate

generally  management obtains the fair value of investment securities at the end of each reporting period via a third party pricing service 
management  with the assistance of an independent investment advisory firm  reviewed the valuation process used by the third party and believes that process is valid 
on a quarterly basis management corroborates the fair values of investment securities by obtaining pricing from an independent investment advisory firm and compares the two sets of fair values 
any significant variances are reviewed and investigated 
in addition  the company has instituted a practice of further testing the fair values by selecting a sample of securities from each category of investment securities 
for that sample  the prices are further validated by management  with assistance from an independent investment advisory firm  by obtaining details of the inputs used by the pricing service 
those inputs were independently tested and we concluded the fair values were consistent with gaap requirements and securities were properly classified in the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   existing gross unrealized losses of  are considered to be temporary in nature due to market interest rate fluctuations and illiquid markets  not reduced estimated cash flows  and the company has the ability and the intent to hold the related securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery  which may be at maturity 
as discussed below   of the total unrealized losses relate to one pooled tps 
all of the company s state and political subdivisions investments are with iowa communities  except for two issues from nebraska  and all are considered to have acceptable credit risks 
collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities consist of residential mortgage pass through securities guaranteed by gnma or issued by fnma and real estate mortgage investment conduits guaranteed by fhlmc or gnma 
corporate notes include one issuance by the student loan mortgage association with a fair value of  and an unrealized loss of as of december   which is scheduled to mature in  and is considered to have acceptable credit risk 
the debt obligations were all within the credit ratings acceptable under west bank s investment policy 
the company believes the unrealized loss of on an investment in one single issuer tps issued by heartland financial  usa  inc is due to market conditions  not reduced estimated cash flows 
the company does not have the intent to sell this security  does not anticipate that this security will be required to be sold before anticipated recovery  and expects full principal and interest will be collected 
therefore  the company does not consider this investment to be otti at december  
table of contents as of december   the company held a pooled tps  alesco preferred funding x  ltd  with an unrealized loss of  that is otti and has been placed on nonaccrual status 
the accrual of interest on an investment security is discontinued when a security is deemed otti 
the company engaged an independent consulting firm to assist management with the valuation of this security 
based on that valuation  management determined the security had an estimated fair value of  at december  the methodology for determining the appropriate discount rate for a tps for purposes of determining fair value combines an evaluation of current market yields for comparable corporate and structured credit products with an evaluation of the risks associated with the tps cash flows in question 
details on the methodology for determining fair value for this security is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
based on the valuation work performed for this security  credit losses of   and were recognized for the years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   the unrealized loss of  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes of  the company will continue to periodically estimate the present value of cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the security 
at december   the most significant risk of a future impairment charge relates to the company s investment in tps of other banks discussed above 
as previously mentioned  management has concluded that only the pooled tps is otti 
any potential future loss that would be considered a credit loss or an increase in the amount of the unrealized loss attributed to credit  would negatively impact net income and regulatory capital  however  as previously noted  the fair market value adjustment at december   has already been recorded against equity 
as of december   the company did not have securities from a single issuer  except for the united states government or its agencies  which exceeded percent of consolidated stockholders equity 
loan portfolio types of loans the following table sets forth the composition of the company s loan portfolio by segment as of the dates indicated 
as of december commercial real estate construction  land  and land development family residential first mortgages home equity commercial consumer and other loans total loans deferred loan fees  net total loans  net of deferred fees as of december   the total amount of loans was approximately percent of total deposits and percent of total assets 
as of december   the majority of all loans were originated directly by west bank to borrowers within west bank s principal market areas 
there were no non us loans outstanding during the years presented 
loans outstanding declined approximately percent compared to the end of the majority of the decline was in the commercial segment 
the loan pipeline as of january is improving and management believes the company is well positioned to grow its loan portfolio 
commercial loans consist primarily of loans to businesses for various purposes  including revolving lines to finance current operations  inventory and accounts receivable  and capital expenditure loans to finance equipment and other fixed assets 
these loans generally have short maturities  have either adjustable or fixed rates  and are either unsecured or secured by inventory  accounts receivable  and or fixed assets 

table of contents real estate loans include various types of loans for which west bank holds real property as collateral  and consist of loans on commercial properties and single and multifamily residences 
real estate loans are typically structured to mature or reprice every years with payments based on up to year amortization periods 
the majority of construction loans are to contractors and developers for construction of commercial buildings or residential real estate 
these loans typically have maturities of up to months 
west bank originates residential real estate loans for its portfolio and for sale in the secondary market for a fee 
consumer loans include loans extended to individuals for household  family  and other personal expenditures not secured by real estate 
the majority of west bank s consumer lending is for vehicles  consolidation of personal debts  and household improvements 
the interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk  the amount of the loan  and the maturity of the loan 
competitive pressures  market interest rates  the availability of funds  and government regulation further influence the rate charged on a loan 
west bank follows a loan policy that has been approved by west bank s board of directors 
the loan policy is reviewed at least annually and is updated as considered necessary 
the policy establishes lending limits  review criteria  and other guidelines  such as for loan administration and the allowance for loan losses 
loans are approved by west bank s board of directors and or designated officers in accordance with the applicable guidelines and underwriting policies 
loans to any one borrower are limited by state banking laws 
loan officer lending authorities vary according to the individual loan officer s experience and expertise 
maturities of loans the contractual maturities of the company s loan portfolio are as shown in the following tables 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because individual borrowers may have the right to prepay loans with or without prepayment penalties 
loans as of december  within one year after one but within five years after five years total commercial real estate construction  land  and land development family residential first mortgages home equity commercial consumer and other loans total loans after one but within five years after five years loan maturities after one year with fixed rates variable rates

the accrual of interest on past due and other impaired loans is generally discontinued when loan payments are past due days or when  in the opinion of management  the borrower may be unable to make payments as they become due 
interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received 
generally  all payments received while a loan is on nonaccrual status are applied to the principal balance of the loan 
in certain cases  interest may continue to accrue on loans past due more than days when the value of the collateral is sufficient to cover both the principal amount of the loan and accrued interest and the loan is in the process of collection 
interest income on troubled debt restructured loans tdr is recognized pursuant to the revised terms of the loan agreement 
a tdr may be reported in the nonaccrual category if it is not performing in accordance with its revised terms 
interest income on other impaired loans is monitored and based upon the terms of the underlying loan agreement 
however  the recorded net investment in impaired loans  including accrued interest  is limited to the present value of the expected cash flows of the impaired loan or the observable fair market value of the loan s collateral 
outstanding loans of  were placed on nonaccrual status during charge offs of  were recorded in related to nonaccrual loans and  was transferred to other real estate owned 
a loan may be removed from nonaccrual status when payments have resumed and it is reasonable to expect continued payment performance 
for the years ended december    and  interest income that would have been recorded during the nonaccrual period under the original terms of such loans was approximately   and  respectively 
a loan may be considered a tdr loan when the interest rate is reduced below that of a new loan with comparable risk or the term is extended beyond the original maturity date and the borrower is considered to be experiencing financial difficulties 
the payment history of the customer  along with a current analysis of its cash flows  is used to determine the restructured terms 
underwriting procedures are similar to those of new loan originations and renewals of performing loans in that current financial statements and tax returns are obtained and analyzed 
a current assessment of collateral is performed 
the approval process for tdrs is the same as that for new loans 
the tdrs with extended terms are accounted for as impaired until ongoing performance is established 
any tdr with an interest rate concession remains in tdr status until paid off 
the average balance of all impaired loans during was approximately  interest income recognized on impaired loans in   and was approximately   and  respectively 

table of contents as of december   west bank had identified approximately  to three commercial real estate customers   to two commercial customers  and to a residential mortgage customer as potential problem loans 
none of these loans were in default at the end of the year 
it is not now possible to predict the degree of problems these loans may develop 
however  west bank is closely monitoring each of them 
the composition of other real estate owned as of december  and  is shown in the following table 
construction  land development  and other land family residential properties multifamily commercial properties the company is actively marketing the assets included in the previous table 
valuations of other real estate owned are performed by management at least annually and sometimes more frequently  so that the properties are carried at current market value less estimated disposal costs 
market values are determined by obtaining updated appraisals or other market information 
unfortunately  demand for commercial real estate and development land remains weak 
management realizes the longer real estate is held in this economic climate  the more susceptible the company is to declines in value 
the construction and land development category includes four properties in the des moines metropolitan area  one property in the iowa city market  one property in missouri  and one property in arkansas 
the family properties consist of two homes in the des moines area 
the multifamily category consists of one apartment building in the des moines area 
the commercial properties consist of two commercial facilities in the des moines area 
summary of the allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents charges made to earnings to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
factors considered in establishing an appropriate allowance include an assessment of the financial condition of the borrower  the value and adequacy of loan collateral  the condition of the local economy and the condition of the specific industry of the borrower  the levels and trends of loans by segment  and a review of delinquent and classified loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated quarterly by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
this evaluation focuses on factors such as specific loan reviews  changes in the components of the loan portfolio given the current and forecasted economic conditions  and historical loss experience 
any one of the following conditions may result in the review of a specific loan concern about whether the customer s cash flow or net worth is sufficient to repay the loan  delinquency status  criticism of the loan in a regulatory examination  the suspension of interest accrual  or other factors  including whether the loan has other special or unusual characteristics that suggest special monitoring is warranted 
the company s concentration risks include geographic concentration in central iowa 
the local economy is comprised primarily of service industries and state and county governments 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  further reduction in the carrying amounts of loans may be necessary based on changes in circumstances or later acquired information 
furthermore  changes in future economic activity are always uncertain 
identifiable sectors within the general economy are subject to additional volatility  which at any time may have a substantial impact on the loan portfolio 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as integral parts of their examination processes  periodically review the estimated losses on loans 
such agencies may require west bank to recognize additional losses based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 

table of contents change in the allowance for loan losses west bank s policy is to charge off loans when  in management s opinion  the loan is deemed uncollectible  although concerted efforts are made to maximize future recoveries 
the following table summarizes activity in the company s allowance for loan losses by loan segment for the years indicated  including amounts of loans charged off  amounts of recoveries  additions to the allowance charged to income  and related ratios

commercial recoveries in included  related to two customers 
west bank has a significant portion of its loan portfolio in commercial real estate loans  commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  and construction or land development loans 
west bank s typical commercial borrower is a small or medium sized  privately owned iowa business person or entity 
west bank s commercial loans typically have greater credit risks than residential mortgage or consumer loans because they often have larger balances and repayment usually depends on the borrowers successful business operations 
commercial loans also involve additional risks because they generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and  thus  usually require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity 
when the economy turns downward  as was experienced in and  commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans and the value of their assets  which are usually pledged as collateral  may decrease rapidly and significantly 
although management believes that the real estate markets in which west bank makes loans are not as depressed as in some other parts of the country  we believe that real estate related credit risks continue to be higher than normal in our markets 

table of contents nonperforming assets continued to decline in we are experiencing changes in the components of nonperforming assets as certain loans move from nonaccrual status to other real estate owned to ultimate disposition 
breakdown of allowance for loan losses by category the following table sets forth information concerning the company s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by segment as of the dates indicated 
amount amount amount amount amount balance at end of period applicable to commercial real estate construction  land  and land development family residential first mortgages home equity commercial consumer and other loans percent of loans in each category to total loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses is dependent upon the change in balances outstanding in the various categories  the historical net loss experience by category  which can vary over time  specific reserves for loans considered impaired  and management s assessment of economic factors that may influence potential losses in the loan portfolio 
prior to  the historical experience factor was calculated using a three year average 
that average was updated once per year at the end of each calendar year 
in  that calculation was modified to use a rolling quarter average 
it was felt that by using a rolling quarter average  the most recent charge off experience is factored into the analysis sooner 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december   includes specific reserves of in the commercial category for two borrowers   in the construction  land  and land development category for three borrowers  in the residential mortgage category for one borrower  in the home equity category for two borrowers  in the commercial real estate category for one borrower  and in the consumer category for one borrower 
additional details on the allowance for loan losses is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
deposits the company s primary source of funds is customer deposits 
total deposits as of december   were  a reduction of percent compared to the end of the decline was primarily in certificates of deposit  which declined  compared to december  the majority of the reduction was due to the decision to let the company s wholesale deposits mature and a decline in commercial certificates of deposit balances 
while approximately percent of west bank s total certificates of deposit mature in the next year  it is anticipated that a significant portion of these certificates will be renewed 
rate sensitive certificates of deposit in excess of experience somewhat higher volatility with regard to renewal volume as west bank adjusts rates based upon funding needs 
in the event a substantial volume of certificates are not renewed  management believes the company has sufficient liquid assets and borrowing lines to fund the potential runoff 
however  a sustained reduction in overall deposit volume would have a significant negative impact on the company s operations and liquidity 

table of contents the following table shows the amounts and remaining maturities of time certificates of deposit with balances of or more as of december  months or less over through months over through months over months the following table sets forth the average balances for each major category of deposits and the weighted average interest rate paid for those deposits during the years indicated 
years ended december amount rate amount rate amount rate noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand reward me checking other interest bearing demand money market savings smartypig savings other savings time certificates the rate on the reward me checking product is expected to decline further in due to implementation of a rate reduction in december interest rates on time certificates may also trend slightly lower in as current certificates mature and are reinvested at current market rates 
other deposit rates are not expected to change significantly until there is a change in market rates 
borrowed funds the following table summarizes the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average rate for each category of borrowed funds as of the dates indicated 
as of december balance rate balance rate balance rate subordinated notes fhlb advances federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase other short term borrowings

unless market rates on long term borrowings increase considerably  that is not expected to occur 
the fluctuation in the balances of federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase is dependent upon the loan demand and investment strategy of downstream correspondent banks for federal funds purchased and customer cash flows for securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
other short term borrowings as of december  and consisted of treasury  tax  and loan option notes 
that program ended on december  off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  west bank commits to extend credit in the form of loan commitments and standby letters of credit in order to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these commitments expose west bank to varying degrees of credit and market risks in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and are subject to the same credit policies as are loans recorded on the balance sheets 
west bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
west bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
management of the company does not expect any significant losses as a result of these commitments 
off balance sheet commitments are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth the balance of contractual obligations of the company by maturity period as of december  payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years deposits federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase subordinated notes fhlb advances noncancelable operating lease commitments total liquidity and capital resources the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for profitable business expansion 
the company s principal source of funds is deposits 
other sources include loan principal repayments  proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities  principal payments on collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities  federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  advances from the fhlb  and funds provided by operations 
liquidity management is conducted on both a daily and a long term basis 
investments in liquid assets are adjusted based on expected loan demand  projected loan maturities and payments  expected deposit flows  and the objectives set by west bank s asset liability management policy 
the company had liquid assets cash and cash equivalents of  at december   a decline of from december  west bank had additional borrowing capacity available from the fhlb of approximately  at december  in addition  west bank has  in borrowing capacity available through unsecured and  available through secured federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks 
west bank was not drawing on any of these lines of credit as of december  net cash from continuing operating activities contributed   and  to liquidity for the years   and  respectively 
the combination of high levels of potentially liquid assets  cash flows from operations  and additional borrowing capacity provide strong liquidity for the company as of december  the company and west bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies 
those requirements include a requirement for bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks to maintain total capital to risk weighted assets of at least percent  of which at least half must be tier capital  and a tier leverage ratio of at least percent 
as of december   the company had a total risk based capital ratio of percent  a tier capital ratio of percent  and a tier leverage ratio of percent 
west bank had ratios of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
as these ratios indicate  both the company and west bank are considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes as of december  the company s total stockholders equity declined to  at december   from  at december  the reduction was due to the june repurchase of  of preferred stock issued to the treasury department through the capital purchase program 
in addition  the company repurchased the warrant issued as a part of this program in august for this reduction in stockholders equity was partially offset by net income less preferred and common stock dividends paid and increased accumulated other comprehensive income due to unrealized gains in the investment portfolio 
at december   total stockholders equity was percent of total assets  compared to percent at december  tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets at december   was percent compared to percent at december  on march   the company filed a registration statement registering up to  for future sales of common or preferred stock 
this provides a possible source of capital in the event growth opportunities present themselves 
no material capital expenditures or material changes in the capital resource mix are anticipated at this time 

table of contents effects of new statements of financial accounting standards a discussion of the effects of new financial accounting standards and developments as they relate to the company is located in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the exposure to earnings and capital arising from changes in interest rates 
management s objectives are to manage interest rate risk to work for consistent growth of earnings and capital 
interest rate risk management focuses on fluctuations in net interest income identified through computer simulations used to evaluate volatility  interest rate  spread  and volume assumptions 
this risk is quantified and compared against tolerance levels 
the company uses a purchased computer software simulation modeling program to measure its exposure to potential interest rate changes 
for various assumed hypothetical changes in market interest rates  this analysis measures the estimated change in net interest income 
the simulation modeling program allows for ongoing assessment of interest rate sensitivity and can include the impact of potential new business strategies 
another measure of interest rate sensitivity is the gap ratio 
this ratio indicates the amount of interest earning assets repricing within a given period in comparison to the amount of interest bearing liabilities repricing within the same period of time 
a gap ratio of indicates a matched position  in which case the effect on net interest income due to interest rate movements will be minimal 
a gap ratio of less than indicates that more liabilities than assets reprice within the time period  and a ratio greater than indicates that more assets reprice than liabilities 
the company s gap ratio is shown on the following page 
inflation the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased asset yields  deposit costs  and operating overhead 
unlike most industries  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than they would have on non financial companies 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
the effects of inflation can magnify the growth of assets and  if significant  require that equity capital increase at a faster rate than otherwise would be necessary 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is comprised primarily of interest rate risk arising from its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates may adversely affect the company s net interest income 
management continually develops and applies strategies to mitigate this risk 
management does not believe that the company s primary market risk exposure and management of that exposure in materially changed compared to the following table presents the estimated change in net interest income for the coming twelve months under several scenarios of assumed interest rate changes for the rate shock levels shown scenario change basis points rising basis points rising basis points rising base as of december   the estimated effect of an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would cause the company s net interest income to increase by approximately percent  or  in the estimated effect of an immediate decrease in rates is not reasonably calculable due to the current historically low interest rate environment 
because the majority of liabilities subject to interest rate movements in the short term are of the type that generally lag interest rate movements in the market  they do not change by the same magnitude in the short term as the change in market rates 
computations of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
actual values may differ from those projections set forth above 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 

table of contents the following table sets forth the estimated maturity  expected cash flows or repricing opportunities  and the resulting interest sensitivity gap of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest sensitivity gap at december  the expected maturities are presented on a contractual basis or  if more relevant  are based on projected call dates 
actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because of prepayment assumptions and early withdrawal of deposits 
months or less over through months over through years over years total interest earning assets loans securities available for sale federal funds sold and other short term investments federal home loan bank stock total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing deposits savings  interest bearing demand  and money markets time federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreement to repurchase long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap per period cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio as of december   the company s cumulative gap ratio for assets and liabilities repricing within one year was  meaning that the company is liability sensitive over the cumulative twelve month period 
in other words  more interest bearing liabilities will be subject to repricing within that time frame than interest earning assets 
however  the majority of the interest bearing liabilities subject to repricing within these time frames are savings  money market  and interest bearing demand deposits 
these types of deposits generally do not reprice as quickly or by the same magnitude as changes in other short term interest rates
