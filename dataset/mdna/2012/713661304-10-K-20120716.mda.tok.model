item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing first in class monoclonal antibodies for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer 
we are currently advancing our two phase ii oncology programs with our lead product candidates  bavituximab and cotara 
in addition  we are advancing our lead imaging agent  i pgn pgn  into clinical development for the imaging of multiple solid tumor types 
our pipeline of novel investigational monoclonal antibodies is based on two first in class technology platforms  including phosphatidylserine ps targeting antibodies and dna histone targeting antibody cotara 
bavituximab is our lead ps targeting antibody that has demonstrated broad therapeutic potential in combination with chemotherapy across multiple oncology indications and represents a new approach to treating cancer 
ps is a highly immunosuppressive molecule usually located inside the membrane surface of healthy cells  but flips and becomes exposed on the outside of cells that line tumor blood vessels  creating a specific target for anti cancer treatments 
ps targeting antibodies target and bind to ps and block this immunosuppressive signal  thereby enabling the immune system to recognize and fight the tumor 
bavituximab s therapeutic potential is currently being evaluated in seven clinical trials including three randomized phase ii trials in second line non small cell lung cancer nsclc  front line nsclc  and front line pancreatic cancer  as well as in four investigator sponsored trials ist in additional oncology indications 
our current lead indication clinical study is a randomized  double blinded  placebo controlled phase ii second line nsclc study evaluating two dose levels of bavituximab plus docetaxel bavituximab containing arms versus docetaxel plus placebo control arm as second line treatment in patients with stage iiib or stage iv nsclc 
in may  we announced positive top line overall response rate orr data primary endpoint and median progression free survival pfs one secondary endpoint from this trial from evaluable patients  based on independent radiology reviews and current status of patients as of that date  as shown in the following table treatment arm placebo plus docetaxel bavituximab mg kg plus docetaxel bavituximab mg kg plus docetaxel overall response rate median progression free survival months months months in addition  another secondary endpoint  median overall survival os  in the control arm has already been determined at less than months  while the median has not been reached in either bavituximab containing arm 
we anticipate announcing median os from this trial in the second half of calendar year  but this is a time to event endpoint and could take longer to reach 

based on these encouraging data and our discussions with medical advisors  our strategy is to pursue phase iii development with bavituximab in second line nsclc 
we are also conducting a randomized phase ii trial designed to evaluate bavituximab plus carboplatin and paclictaxel versus carboplatin and paclitaxel alone as front line therapy in patients with stage iiib or stage iv nsclc 
in march  we announced top line orr primary endpoint and current median pfs one secondary endpoint from this trial from evaluable patients 
initial orr and median pfs data from this study were deemed inconclusive and therefore  we believe median os one secondary endpoint will be an important data point from this study and instrumental in determining our next steps in advancing bavituximab in front line nsclc in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
we anticipate announcing median os from this trial in the second half of calendar year  but this is a time to event endpoint and could take longer to reach 
in addition to our nsclc trials  in june  we announced the completion of patient enrollment in our phase ii randomized trial evaluating bavituximab in combination with gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone in patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer patients 
the primary endpoint from this trial is median os and the secondary endpoints are orr and median pfs 
interim data from this trial is expected in the second half of calendar year with respect to ists  our clinical collaborators are evaluating new bavituximab drug combinations and additional oncology indications in the following trials i a phase i ii trial evaluating bavituximab combined with sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  or liver cancer  ii a phase i ii trial evaluating bavituximab combined with cabazitaxel in second line castration resistant prostate cancer crpc  iii a phase ib trial evaluating bavituximab combined with pemetrexed and carboplatin in front line nsclc  and iv a phase i trial evaluating bavituximab combined with paclitaxel in patients with her negative metastatic breast cancer 
enrollment is ongoing in each of the four ist s 
in addition to bavituximab s therapeutic potential to treat multiple solid tumors  we believe these ps targeting antibodies may have broad potential for the imaging and diagnosis of multiple diseases  including cancer 
in april  we filed an investigational new drug application ind with the united states food and drug administration fda to advance our lead imaging agent pgn into clinical development for the imaging of multiple solid tumor types 
our initial goal for the pgn program is to further validate the broad nature of the ps targeting platform 
the trial will enroll up to patients and results from this study may open the door for multiple applications including development of antibody drug conjugates adc  the ability of pgn to monitor the effectiveness of current standard cancer treatments  and the ability to potentially select patients that may benefit from bavituximab based treatment 
cotara is our lead dna histone h targeting antibody based on our tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform 
a novel approach to treating brain cancer  cotara is a monoclonal antibody linked to a radioisotope that is administered as a single infusion  one time therapy directly into the tumor  destroying the tumor from the inside out  with minimal exposure to healthy tissue 
in calendar year  we reported what we believe is promising median os of months in patients with glioblastoma multiforme gbm at first relapse following a single dose of cotara in a phase ii clinical trial 
based on these data and data from earlier clinical studies  we have entered into active discussion with the fda regarding a registration pathway for cotara to further advance the program 
cotara has been granted orphan drug status and fast track designation for the treatment of gbm and anaplastic astrocytoma by the fda 
in addition to our clinical research and development efforts  we operate a wholly owned cgmp current good manufacturing practices contract manufacturing subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc avid 
avid is a contract manufacturing organization that provides fully integrated services from cell line development to commercial cgmp biomanufacturing for peregrine and avid s third party clients 
in addition to generating revenue from providing a broad range of biomanufacturing services to third party clients  avid is strategically integrated with peregrine to manufacture all clinical products to support our clinical trials while also preparing for potential commercial launch 
going concern our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
historically  we have funded a significant portion of our operations through the issuance of equity 
during fiscal year  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to april  and through june  we raised an additional  in gross proceeds under an at market issuance agreement as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of june   additional shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to  may be available under our current effective shelf registration statements on form s although we believe we can raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations through fiscal year  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets is also dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for our common stock 
the market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  negative economic conditions  adverse market conditions  adverse clinical trials results  and significant delays in one or more clinical trials 
if our ability to access the capital markets becomes severely restricted  it could have a negative impact on our business plans  including our clinical trial programs and other research and development activities 
in addition  even if we are able to raise additional capital  it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  although we have historically financed our operations through the issuance of equity  we may also raise additional capital through the issuance of debt  licensing or partnering our products in development  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in securing debt financing  license or partner our products in development  or generate additional revenue from avid to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  and assuming we do not generate any additional revenues or raise any additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the third quarter of our fiscal year ending january  there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party contracts  technical challenges  the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future clinical trials  any of which could reduce  delay or accelerate our future projected cash inflows and outflows 
in addition  in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the third quarter of our fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change revenues contract manufacturing    government contract revenue   license revenue     total revenues    cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing   research and development   selling  general and administrative   total cost and expenses    loss from operations    other income expense interest and other income    interest and other expense    net loss    contract manufacturing revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the number of completed manufacturing runs released and shipped in the current year  which can be attributed to an increase in demand of manufacturing services from avid s third party customers 
based on the current demand for services from avid s third party customers  we expect contract manufacturing revenue for fiscal year to exceed contract manufacturing revenue reported in fiscal year year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the level of services provided to third party customers compared to fiscal year combined with the timing of services provided to third party customers 
the fiscal year decrease in services was primarily due to the loss of two customers in fiscal year that were acquired by larger companies with internal manufacturing capabilities  which was offset by the addition of a new customer in fiscal year each of the aforementioned customers represented more than of contract manufacturing revenue in the respective fiscal years 
in addition  the timing of services provided to third party customers also attributed to the decrease in contract manufacturing revenue as we initiated several third party manufacturing runs during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  all of which were subsequently reported as revenue in fiscal year government contract revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  government contract revenue was derived from a former government contract the government contract awarded to us in june  through the transformational medical technologies of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the purpose of the government contract  which expired on april   was to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the current year decrease in government contract revenue was directly related to the expiration of the government contract on april  year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in government contract revenue of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to a decrease in the level of research and development services performed during fiscal year under the government contract in accordance with the contract s project plan 
license revenue years ended april  and compared to the years ended april  and the increases in license revenue of  and  during the years ended april  and  respectively  compared to fiscal years and  respectively  was directly related to revenue recognized in accordance with the terms of an assignment agreement associated with our tumor necrosis therapy technologies and a license agreement associated with our anti vegf antibody technology  respectively 
although we expect to continue to recognize license revenue under our existing license agreements with unrelated entities during fiscal year  we do not expect license revenue to significantly differ from fiscal year based on our current agreements 
cost of contract manufacturing year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in cost of contract manufacturing of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily related to the current year increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue fluctuates from year to year based on the mix of services provided and the gross margins associated with these services 
during fiscal year  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue improved to compared to in fiscal year the current year improvement was primarily attributed to the increase in revenue associated with the increased number of completed manufacturing runs 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in cost of contract manufacturing of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily related to the fiscal year decrease in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was primarily due to i the fiscal year decrease in the level of manufacturing services provided to third party customers due to the decrease in the number of completed manufacturing runs  and ii the write off of certain material manufactured for a third party customer that did not meet certain specifications for product release 
research and development expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform phosphatidylserine ps targeting   tnt cotara    other research    total r d expenses    o ps targeting technology platform the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in clinical trial and related expenses  payroll and related expenses  and manufacturing costs to support the advancement of our later stage clinical program for bavituximab 
during the current fiscal year  we continued to treat patients in three separate randomized multi center phase ii clinical trials using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with i front line non small cell lung cancer nsclc  ii second line nsclc  and iii pancreatic cancer  and announced the completion of patient enrollment of the front and second line nsclc trials during september and october  respectively 
we also continued to enroll and treat patients in a randomized phase ii clinical trial using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with previously untreated genotype hepatitis c virus hcv infection and announced the completion of patient enrollment during september these increases in ps targeting clinical program expenses were further supplemented by increases in preclinical r d expenses associated with exploring our ps targeting antibodies potential to image tumors  which supported our recent filing of an investigational new drug application with the united states food and drug administration during april to advance our lead imaging candidate i pgn into clinical development 
these increases in ps targeting program expenses were offset with a decrease in r d expenses directly related to our former government contract with the tmt  which expired on april   and a decrease in expenses associated with the development of additional ps targeting antibodies under a research agreement with an unrelated entity 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform cotara the increase in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily related to increased development costs associated with preparing cotara for potential later stage clinical trials for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme or brain cancer 
these increases in tnt program expenses were offset by current year decreases in clinical trial expenses primarily associated with our phase ii trial for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm  which completed patient enrollment during fiscal year based on our current projections  we expect research and development expenses in fiscal year to decrease in comparison to fiscal year this anticipated decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal year is primarily related to lower anticipated clinical trials costs since we completed patient enrollment in three of the four company sponsored phase ii bavituximab studies in fiscal year these projections include a number of uncertainties  including but not limited to  i the uncertainty of obtaining regulatory approval to advance our current phase ii clinical programs to phase iii or to commence any future trials  ii the uncertainty of the rate at which patients will be enrolled into any current or future clinical trials  iii the uncertainty of terms related to any potential future partnering or licensing arrangement  and  iv the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts beyond the third quarter of our fiscal year during fiscal year  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in r d expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to the following changes associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform phosphatidylserine ps targeting   tnt cotara    other    total r d expenses    o ps targeting technology platform the increase in ps targeting program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in clinical trial and related expenses  payroll and related expenses  share based compensation expense non cash  and consulting fees to support the advancement of our later stage clinical program for bavituximab 
during fiscal year  we initiated three separate randomized multi center phase ii clinical trials using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of patients with i front line non small cell lung cancer nsclc  ii second line nsclc  and iii pancreatic cancer 
we also initiated a randomized phase ii clinical trial using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with hepatitis c virus hcv infection 
in addition to our company sponsored later stage phase ii clinical trials  we also established an investigator sponsored trial program during fiscal year that resulted in three new studies using bavituximab for the treatment of patients with liver cancer  her negative metastatic breast cancer  and locally advanced or metastatic nsclc 
these ps targeting clinical program expenses were further supplemented by increases in r d expenses associated with the development of additional ps targeting antibodies 
these increases in ps targeting program expenses were offset with a decrease in r d expenses directly related to our former government contract with the tmt  which expired on april   as the level of r d activities performed under the government contract had decreased compared to fiscal year in accordance with the project plan under the contract 
o tumor necrosis therapy tnt technology platform cotara tnt program expenses for the year ended april  remained in line with fiscal year and increased slightly by  as we continued our efforts to advance our cotara clinical program  including the completion of a phase ii trial using cotara for the treatment of recurrent gbm or brain cancer 
o other r d programs the decrease in our other r d program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to our efforts to curtail spending on earlier stage technologies associated with our anti angiogenesis agents and vascular targeting agents in order to focus our efforts and resources on our current later stage clinical programs 
looking beyond the next twelve months  we expect to continue to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our ps targeting technology platform although it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with preclinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our studies to move forward from phase ii clinical studies to phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs  and the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts beyond the third quarter of our fiscal year we or our potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  preclinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting  and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the united states food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  share based compensation expense  legal and accounting fees  patent fees  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the year ended april  remained in line with the prior year increasing slightly by  year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in sg a expenses of  or during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to increases in share based compensation expense non cash and payroll and related expenses 
the fiscal year increase in share based compensation expense of  was primarily related to the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees and board members under a broad based grant during february the fiscal year increase in payroll and related expenses of  was primarily the result of increased employee headcount  compensation  and other employee related expenses to support our later stage clinical development activities 
these increases were further supplemented with fiscal year increases associated with patent filing and maintenance fees  market research analysis fees  travel and related expenses  facility related expenses  and other general corporate related expenses 
interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april   compared to the prior year was due to a decrease in other income of  combined with a  decrease in interest income 
the current year decrease in other income was directly related to a government grant of  awarded to us in fiscal year under section d of the internal revenue code 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was due to an increase in other income of  offset by a  decrease in interest income 
the increase in other income was directly related to the government grant of  awarded to us in fiscal year under section d of the internal revenue code as reimbursement for four separate qualifying therapeutic discovery projects  which we applied for under the patient protection and affordable care act of interest and other expense years ended april  and compared to the years ended april  and the decreases in interest and other expense of  and  during the years ended april  and  respectively  compared to fiscal years and  respectively  was directly related to a lower outstanding principal balance associated with the  term loan we secured in december  which we paid in full in december critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
we review our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we currently derive revenue from the following two sources i contract manufacturing services provided by avid  and ii licensing revenues related to agreements associated with peregrine s technologies under development 
in addition  from june  through april   we derived government contract revenues from services provided under a government contract awarded to us through the transformational medical technologies tmt of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the government contract with the tmt expired on april  we recognize revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or passage of title has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we also comply with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition regarding arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in addition  we also follow the authoritative guidance when reporting revenue as gross when we act as a principal versus reporting revenue as net when we act as an agent 
for transactions in which we act as a principal  have discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and perform a substantive part of the services  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer and costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of cost of sales for contract manufacturing services and as a component of research and development expense for services provided under our former contract with the tmt contract expired on april  
contract manufacturing revenue revenue associated with contract manufacturing services provided by avid is recognized once the service has been rendered and or upon shipment or passage of title of the product to the customer 
on occasion  we recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under bill and hold arrangements  revenue is recognized once the product is complete and ready for shipment  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  management receives a written request from the customer for bill and hold treatment  the product is segregated from other inventory  and no further performance obligations exist 
there were no bill and hold arrangements outstanding as of april  and any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
license revenue revenue associated with licensing agreements primarily consist of non refundable upfront license fees  non refundable annual license fees and milestone payments 
non refundable upfront license fees received under license agreements  whereby continued performance or future obligations are considered inconsequential to the relevant license technology  are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the technology 
if a licensing agreement has multiple elements  we analyze each element of our licensing agreements and consider a variety of factors in determining the appropriate method of revenue recognition of each element 
multiple element arrangements 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
on may   if a license agreement has multiple element arrangements  we analyze and determine whether the deliverables  which often include performance obligations  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
under multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  and revenue is recognized over the estimated period of when the performance obligation s are performed 
in addition  under certain circumstances  when there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items in an arrangement  but no such evidence for the delivered items  we utilize the residual method to allocate the consideration received under the arrangement 
under the residual method  the amount of consideration allocated to delivered items equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items  and revenue is recognized upon delivery of the undelivered items based on the relative fair value of the undelivered items 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
for new licensing agreements or material modifications of existing licensing agreements entered into after may   we follow the provisions of asu no 
if a licensing agreement includes multiple elements  we identify which deliverables represent separate units of accounting  and then determine how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting  which may require the use of significant judgment 
if a licensing agreement includes multiple elements  a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the licensing partner on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each agreement  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company s control 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  the company uses its best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement 
milestone payments 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
on may   milestone payments were recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the specified milestone  provided that i the milestone event was substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  ii the fees were non refundable  and iii there was no continuing performance obligations associated with the milestone payment 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria were recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
effective may   we adopted on a prospective basis the milestone method under asu no 
for new licensing agreements or material modifications of existing licensing agreements entered into after may  under the milestone method  we recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is substantive in its entirety 
a milestone is considered substantive when it meets all of the following criteria the consideration is commensurate with either the entity s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity s performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity s performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the company 
the provisions of asu no 
do not apply to contingent consideration for which payment is either contingent solely upon the passage of time or the result of a counterparty s performance 
we will assess the nature of  and appropriate accounting for  these payments on a case by case basis in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance for revenue recognition 
government contract revenue government contract revenue was derived from a former government contract the government contract awarded to us on june   through the transformational medical technologies of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency 
the purpose of the government contract  which expired on april   was to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
the government contract was classified as a cost plus fixed fee contract 
we recognized government contract revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance for revenue recognition including the authoritative guidance specific to federal government contracts 
reimbursable costs under the contract primarily include direct labor  subcontract costs  materials  equipment  travel  and indirect costs 
in addition  we received a fixed fee for our efforts equal to of the reimbursable costs incurred under the government contract  which was unconditionally earned as allowable costs were billed and was not contingent on success factors 
reimbursable costs under this government contract  including the fixed fee  were generally recognized as revenue in the period the reimbursable costs are incurred and become billable 
however  when amounts billable  including the fixed fee  were not reasonably related to the proportionate performance of the total work or services to be performed  we recognized revenue on a proportional performance basis 
in addition  reimbursable costs  including the fixed fee  associated with manufacturing services were recognized as revenue once delivery or passage of title had occurred 
share based compensation expense we account for stock options and awards granted under our equity compensation plans in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the estimated fair value of share based payments to employees in exchange for services is measured at the grant date  using a fair value based method  and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods 
share based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of the share based payment that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
share based compensation expense for a share based payment with a performance condition is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period when the achievement of the performance condition is determined to be probable 
if a performance condition is not determined to be probable or is not met  no share based compensation is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model  which requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
these model inputs include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise activity  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected volatility is based on the daily historical volatility of our stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options granted reflects actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
the expected dividend yield assumption is based on our expectation of future dividend payouts 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and currently do not anticipate paying such cash dividends 
in addition  guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there are a number of factors that affect the amount of share based compensation expense  including the number of employee options granted during subsequent fiscal years  the price of our common stock on the date of grant  the volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and the risk free interest rates 
in addition  we periodically grant stock options and awards to non employee consultants  which we account for in accordance with the authoritative guidance for share based compensation 
the cost of non employee services received in exchange for share based awards are measured based on either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the share based award issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
in addition  guidance requires share based compensation related to unvested options and awards issued to non employees to be recalculated at the end of each reporting period based upon the fair market value on that date until the share based award has vested  and any adjustment to share based compensation resulting from the remeasurement is recognized in the current period 
research and development expenses research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred in accordance with the authoritative guidance for research and development costs 
research and development expenses primarily include i payroll and related costs associated with research and development personnel  ii costs related to clinical and preclinical testing of our technologies under development  iii costs to develop and manufacture the product candidates  including raw materials and supplies  product testing  depreciation  and facility related expenses  iv expenses for research services provided by universities and contract laboratories  including sponsored research funding  and v other research and development expenses 
advance payments  including non refundable amounts  to secure the receipt of future research and development services are deferred and capitalized 
these pre payments are recognized as an expense in the period that the services are performed 
we assess our prepaid research and development expenses for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the prepaid expense may not be recoverable or provide future economic benefit 
in addition  we record research and development expenses based on accruals associated with work performed in connection with advancing our clinical trials  which relies on estimates and or representations from clinical research organizations cros  hospitals  consultants  and other clinical trial related vendors 
we maintain regular communication with our vendors  including our cro vendors  and gauge the reasonableness of estimates provided 
however  actual clinical trial costs may differ from estimated clinical trial costs and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
there were no material adjustments for a change in estimate to research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in any of the three years ended april  fair value measurements we determine fair value measurements in accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures for all assets and liabilities within the scope of this guidance 
this guidance  which among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the guidance prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as assets or liabilities whose values are based on quoted market prices in markets where trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
as of april  and  we do not have any level or level financial assets or liabilities and our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical securities level input 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt 
historically  we have funded a significant portion of our operations through the issuance of equity 
during fiscal year  we raised  in gross proceeds as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to april  and through june  we raised an additional  in gross proceeds under an at market issuance agreement as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of june   additional shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of up to  may be available under our current effective shelf registration statements on form s although we believe we can raise sufficient capital to meet our obligations through fiscal year  our ability to raise additional capital in the equity markets is also dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the market demand for our common stock 
the market demand or liquidity of our common stock is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to  negative economic conditions  adverse market conditions  adverse clinical trials results  and significant delays in one or more clinical trials 
if our ability to access the capital markets becomes severely restricted  it could have a negative impact on our business plans  including our clinical trial programs and other research and development activities 
in addition  even if we are able to raise additional capital  it may not be at a price or on terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  although we have historically financed our operations through the issuance of equity  we may also raise additional capital through the issuance of debt  licensing or partnering our products in development  or increasing revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  avid 
while we will continue to explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in securing debt financing  license or partner our products in development  or generate additional revenue from avid to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  and assuming we do not generate any additional revenues or raise any additional capital from the capital markets or other potential sources  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers to meet our obligations as they become due through at least the third quarter of our fiscal year ending january  there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party contracts  technical challenges  the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future clinical trials  any of which could reduce  delay or accelerate our future projected cash inflows and outflows 
in addition  in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the third quarter of our fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by our net loss 
however  cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported net loss as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during the year ended april   cash used in operating activities increased  to  compared to  for the year ended april  this increase in net cash used in operating activities was due to an increase of  in net loss reported during fiscal year after taking into consideration non cash operating expenses combined with a net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount of  the increase in our fiscal year net loss was primarily due to current year increases in research and development expenses and cost of contract manufacturing  which were offset by the current year increase in total revenues 
the changes in operating activities as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities are as follows year ended april  net loss  as reported   less non cash operating expenses share based compensation   depreciation and amortization   amortization of discount on notes payable and debt issuance costs amortization of expenses paid in shares of common stock loss on disposal of property  common stock issued for services  net cash used in operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities   net change in operating assets and liabilities  net cash used in operating activities   cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended april  this decrease was due to a decrease in other assets of  offset by an increase in property acquisitions of  the current year decrease in other assets was primarily related to prior year deposits and or progress payments for certain additional computer software and leasehold improvements associated with the lease of additional office space 
the current year increase in property acquisitions was primarily related to purchases of certain leasehold improvements and equipment during the current fiscal year 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to  for the year ended april  compared to net cash provided of  for the year ended april  during fiscal year  we received aggregate net proceeds of  under an at market issuance sales agreement and a registered direct public offering  whereby we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock as described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we received net proceeds of  from the purchase of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
these current year net proceeds were offset with principal payments on a term loan payable of  which we paid in full in december  and capital lease payments of contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of april   aggregated by type payments due by period total year years years after years operating leases  net    capital lease obligation    other long term liabilities minimum license obligations total contractual obligations   represents our facility operating leases and various office equipment leases 
represents capital lease agreements to finance certain equipment 
amounts include principal and interest 
represents licensing agreements we periodically enter into with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay annual maintenance fees and potential future milestone payments based on product development success 
amounts exclude milestone or contractual payment obligations if the amount and timing of such obligations are unknown or uncertain 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note  summary of significant accounting policies pending adoption of recent accounting pronouncements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect  if any  on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in us interest rates would affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  however  they would not have an effect on our capital leases  which have fixed interest rates and terms 
based on our overall cash and cash equivalents interest rate exposure at april   a near term change in interest rates  based on historical movements  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
