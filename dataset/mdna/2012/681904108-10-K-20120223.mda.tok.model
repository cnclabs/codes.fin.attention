all amounts disclosed herein relate to the company s continuing operations unless otherwise stated 
executive overview omnicare  inc omnicare or the company is a leading healthcare services company that specializes in the management of complex pharmaceutical care 
the company operates two primary businesses  long term care group ltc and specialty care group scg  each serving a different customer population but sharing a common objective advancing health outcomes at the lowest possible cost 
through ltc  omnicare is the nation s largest provider of pharmaceuticals and related pharmacy and ancillary services to long term care facilities as well as chronic care facilities and other settings 
scg provides commercialization services for the biopharmaceutical industry in addition to end of life pharmaceutical care management for hospice care agencies 
omnicare leverages its specialized clinical capabilities and innovative technology solutions across both primary businesses as key components of the value we believe we provide to our customers 
omnicare services customers across the united states and in canada 

table of contents in  the company continued its heightened operational focus to improve the company s customer service and focus on driving consistent organic growth 
this focus consists of management team changes  redefining the organizational structure  insourcing of certain administrative functions  improving employee relations  reallocating resources to align employee interests  reinforcing a commitment to compliance  beginning a process of updating information technology resources in operations and finance and an overall organization wide focus on serving our customers 
as part of this process  the company s new management team reorganized the business  effective in the fourth quarter of  into two operating segments  ltc and scg 
these segments are based on management s approach for overseeing the operations of the underlying businesses  as well as the customers they serve  and will make it more conducive for the company to further unify its sales  marketing and service offerings for the given businesses 
through ltc  omnicare operates the largest institutional pharmacy business in north america  as measured in both revenues and the number of beds served 
due to the size and scope of ltc  we believe we have unique cost advantages  especially pertaining to the sourcing of pharmaceuticals 
the scale of our operations has also provided us the opportunity to make investments in proprietary automation technology to reduce our dispensing costs while improving the accuracy and consistency of our service delivery 
ltc s customers consist of skilled nursing facilities snfs  assisted living facilities alfs  independent living communities  hospitals  correctional facilities  and other healthcare service providers 
in light of a customer mix that is heavily penetrated in the senior market  we have a high level of insight into geriatric pharmaceutical care 
at december   ltc provided our pharmacy services in states in the united states us  the district of columbia and in canada 
ltc comprised approximately of the company s total net sales during the year ended december   and dispensed approximately million prescriptions 
in connection with the formation of the segments in late  the company changed its methodology for reporting beds to report only on the beds for its ltc business  as the number of beds is not a significant factor for our other businesses 
a chart comparing the old and new methodology is included below total beds other beds ltc beds scg touches a broad spectrum of the healthcare continuum  serving the needs of biopharmaceutical manufacturers  physicians  nurses  caregivers and patients 
our services are largely centered on the specialty pharmaceutical market 
these services are based on five platforms brand support services  third party logistics  patient assistance programs  specialty pharmacy and disease management for end of life care 
our brand support services  third party logistics and patient assistance programs are integrated  fee for service platforms which focus on helping the drug manufacturer market  distribute and obtain reimbursement for their products 
in our specialty pharmacy platform  we provide dispensing of specialized pharmaceuticals that are high cost  have complex reimbursement and supply chain challenges  have limited patient populations and are not available through normal retail channels 
these specialized drugs deal primarily with specific categories of drugs and disease states  such as rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  oncology and growth hormones 
in our end of life care platform  omnicare provides hospice care pharmaceutical management 
scg accounted for approximately of the company s total net sales during the year ended december  in  the company believes it began to see some of the benefits of the heightened operational focus through positive trends in certain of its key business metrics  including scripts dispensed 
additionally  the company s scg business continued its strong performance 
further  the benefit from recently launched generic drugs has served to offset the increased payroll and employee benefit costs associated with omnicare s initiatives to improve its infrastructure and payor driven reimbursement reductions 
omnicare believes it has an attractive business model  with a market leadership position in the long term care market  and its relative position in the growing specialty care market supported by strong cash flows 
omnicare believes its business model positions the company to benefit presently and in the future from certain factors including the favorable impact of branded drug price inflation and the increased availability of generic drugs 
increased generic usage also benefits omnicare s payors  including facility customers and government sponsored health programs  by lowering their healthcare costs 
during  the company s strong cash flow enabled omnicare to pay off million of the notes and also to return approximately of the company s operating cash flow from continuing operations to shareholders  through dividends which were increased from cents per common share to cents per common share during the second quarter of and share repurchases 
also  in  the company completed a debt restructuring which enhanced the company s financial flexibility 
the debt restructuring consisted of a new million senior unsecured credit agreement million senior term loan and million revolving loan  an offering of an additional million aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due  and the redemption of approximately million aggregate principal amount of the company s senior subordinated notes due 
table of contents on september   omnicare commenced a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of the common stock of pharmerica corporation pharmerica for per share in cash 
the tender offer expired on february   at which time certain conditions to the tender offer had not been satisfied and omnicare had not waived those conditions 
no shares of pharmerica common stock were purchased pursuant to the tender offer  and all tendered shares will be returned promptly 
for further description of the company s business activities  see the business caption of part i  item  of this filing 
outlook historically  omnicare s growth was driven largely by acquisitions 
in mid  the company shifted its focus to become more operationally driven and customer focused in an effort to make the organization more efficient and establish consistent organic growth 
the transition to a more operationally driven and customer focused orientation has largely centered on three core operating objectives establish consistent net organic bed growth in ltc reposition scg for an accelerated level of growth create more standardization across the organization by generating net organic bed growth in ltc  omnicare expects to free up additional capital to allocate toward acquisitions or other areas intended to increase value for its shareholders 
following the transition to become more operationally driven  the company began investing in its people and operations to enhance service levels and improve the customer experience 
the company believes that these initiatives have been successful  with omnicare s customer retention rate improving and nearing the level that we believe is necessary to maintain consistent organic bed growth 
moreover  as service continued to improve  the company began investing in the sales component of its operations as well 
by the fourth quarter of  these investments had resulted in omnicare generating net organic bed growth for the first time in eight years 
a continued focus on net organic bed growth in ltc is a key element to the company s long term growth strategy  as we look to better leverage the scale of our operations 
just as omnicare has recently invested in the underlying operations within ltc  it has similarly repositioned its scg to better capitalize on the attractive growth characteristics within the specialty pharmaceutical market 
until late  the businesses that now encompass omnicare s scg operated nearly independently  realizing few synergies from our other businesses 
since creating the scg  however  these businesses have reported into a single management team that is focused on better leveraging the assets of these specialty care businesses 
throughout  the company made a number of organizational investments in its scg to further advance its capabilities while improving its sales results  especially in its fee for service operating platforms third party logistics  brand support services  patient assistance programs 
in fact  omnicare built a manufacturer focused sales organization during  and the company is encouraged by the early results of this group 
according to industry sources  the specialty care industry has recently grown at approximately per annum  and the company believes its recent investments in scg will position us well to maximize our opportunities as specialty pharmaceuticals become an increasingly larger portion of the overall pharmaceutical market 
in addition to repositioning its two primary businesses for organic growth  omnicare has made a number of recent investments to improve the efficiency of its operations while improving dispensing and thereby enhancing patient care 
specifically  the company is in the process of transitioning from two billing and dispensing systems to one new technology platform 
while this is a multi year integration  the company currently expects to benefit from this initiative beginning in late separately  omnicare is also piloting several new automation capabilities within its pharmacies and on site at its customer facilities 
if the pilots are successful  these initiatives are expected to have a broader launch in mid and would then be expected to positively impact profitability beginning in omnicare believes a continued focus on standardizing its operations  both within ltc and scg  will be a source of earnings growth while also adding to the cost advantage the company possesses over most of its competitors 
in addition to the company s internally driven growth objectives  there are certain pharmaceutical market dynamics and demographic developments that may continue to alter the landscape of the industries in which omnicare competes 
specifically  both generic drugs and specialty pharmaceuticals have steadily increased their respective shares of the overall market  and omnicare believes it is positioned well to capitalize on the continued developments in both areas 
with respect to generic drugs  omnicare uses its sophisticated direct sourcing infrastructure to maintain a purchasing advantage while rapidly converting residents to newly available generic alternatives 
because omnicare generally makes a higher profit on generic drugs than branded alternatives  the company believes its interests are fully aligned with its customers and payors  as omnicare benefits from these lower cost 
table of contents alternatives  so do its customers  payors and the residents it serves 
numerous branded drugs the company dispenses in high volumes are expected to lose patent exclusivity over the next few years  creating an attractive growth opportunity for omnicare while also enabling its customers to better manage through any industry cost pressures 
with respect to specialty pharmaceuticals  a number of new treatment alternatives have become available for such complicated therapeutic categories as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis 
omnicare believes that  through its scg  it is well positioned to benefit from the continued introduction of new large molecule compounds and other specialty pharmaceutical therapies 
as more of these products enter the market  the company believes the demand for commercialization services  such as reimbursement support and third party logistics  will continue to increase 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over years old consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services  including prescription drugs  when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly while also improving the quality of life 
these factors are expected to result in a meaningful increase in demand for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry as a potential solution to ensuring our country can maintain the level of services provided under its government sponsored healthcare programs while ensuring healthcare costs are contained 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company believes that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it cannot at this time predict the ultimate effect of any of these initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment  although changes in government reimbursement regulations could significantly adversely impact our operating results 
further  in addition to any potential impacts associated with these regulatory and other matters  factors that could negatively impact the company s future operating results include the impact of pricing adjustments  including from competitive pressures  and bed losses which may result from ongoing competition  as well as an increase in its payroll cost resulting from our operational initiatives 
consolidated results of operations the following summary table presents consolidated financial information and results of operations of omnicare as well as adjusted operating income and adjusted income from continuing operations in thousands 
for the years ended december  net sales operating income adjusted operating income a income from continuing operations adjusted income from continuing operations a a adjusted operating income and adjusted income from continuing operations exclude certain items not considered part of the core operating results of the company and certain non cash charges 
management believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures enhances investors understanding of how management assesses the performance of the company s businesses 
management uses non gaap measures for budgeting purposes  measuring actual results  allocating resources and in determining employee incentive compensation 
omnicare s method of calculating non gaap financial results may differ from those used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be limited

net sales for the year were positively impacted by drug price inflation and growth in scg 
partially offsetting these factors was the unfavorable sales impact of reductions in reimbursement coupled with competitive pricing issues and the increased availability and utilization of generic drugs 
see discussion of sales and operating income results in more detail at the long term care group segment and specialty care group segment captions below 

table of contents gross profit as a percentage of total net sales was for the year ended december   as compared with in gross profit was favorably impacted by the increased availability and utilization of higher margin generic drugs  cost reduction and productivity improvement initiatives  as well as the favorable dollar effect of drug price inflation 
partially offsetting these factors were the unfavorable impact of certain of the aforementioned items that  individually  served to reduce net sales  primarily the reductions in reimbursement coupled with competitive pricing issues and a lower average number of net beds served year over year as well as by increased payroll and employee benefit costs in connection with the company s initiatives to improve its organizational structure 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no or limited increases in fixed costs eg  rent  depreciation  etc 
and negligible to moderate increases in variable costs eg  utilities  labor  etc  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through both internal and acquired growth 
government and other reimbursement formulas generally adjust to take into account drug price inflation or deflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain discounts  rebates and other price concessions discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through timing of brand to generic conversions and discounts relating to purchases from the company s suppliers and vendors 
when recognizing the related receivables associated with these discounts  omnicare accounts for these discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold and inventories 
the company records its estimates of discounts earned during the period on the accrual basis of accounting  giving proper consideration to whether those discounts have been earned based on the terms of applicable arrangements  and to the levels of inventories remaining on hand 
receivables related to discounts are regularly adjusted based on the best available information  and to actual amounts as the applicable arrangements are settled and cash is received 
the aggregate amount of these adjustments has not been significant to the company s operations 
omnicare s consolidated selling  general and administrative operating expenses as a percentage of net sales amounted to in  versus the experienced in the prior year period 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were favorably impacted by continued progress in the company s non drug purchasing program which were offset primarily by increased payroll and employee benefit costs as well as other costs associated with omnicare s initiatives to improve its organizational structure and customer service 
the provision for doubtful accounts represented of net sales in the year ended december  the decrease from the prior year amount of is primarily due to the unfavorable impact in of the fourth quarter implementation of a different strategic approach for the resolution of past due accounts being disputed and or in litigation  resulting in the company recording an incremental charge of million in  which was partially offset by increased provisioning in under the new approach 
investment income for the year ended december  was lower than the amount earned in the comparable prior year period due primarily to lower invested balances in the period  related largely to the liquidation of rabbi trust assets in the second half of and to fund payments to former participants in the company s excess benefit plan  and lower rates earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense was higher in than the prior year period due primarily to certain debt redemption costs recorded in  including tender premiums and the write off of debt issuance costs  related to the company s redemption of approximately million of its outstanding senior subordinated notes  due the notes  and million of its senior subordinated notes the notes 
see additional information at the debt note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the effective tax rates are different than the federal statutory rates largely as a result of the impact of state and local income taxes and certain non deductible litigation costs 
the year over year change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a larger reduction of income tax expense in compared to relating to the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions settled through the expiration of statute of limitations

operating cash flows in were used primarily for debt payments  acquisition related payments  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and dividend payments 
net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were favorably impacted by the year over year change in net income  inventories  accounts payable and non trade receivables  which was partially offset by the reduced favorable impact of trade accounts receivable in comparison to the prior year  as well as tender premiums relating to the company s debt restructuring activities see further information in the cash flows used in financing activities discussion below 
net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by the decrease in net income as well as the year over year change in inventories due to large inventory reductions in as a result of full potential hub and spoke integration activities in these unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a year over year reduction in accounts receivable as well as in the cash requirements relating to accounts payable activity 
net cash flows from operating activities during the year ended december  were unfavorably impacted by a fourth quarter payment of approximately million due to the settlement with the united states attorney s office  district of massachusetts  which was more than offset by the favorable impacts of a reduction in inventory and accounts receivable during favorably impacting operating cash flow was the excess of tax deductible interest expense over book interest expense related to the company s junior subordinated convertible debentures  convertible debentures and convertible notes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk omnicare s primary market risk exposure relates to variable interest rate risk through its variable interest debt and swap agreements related to certain of the company s borrowings 
accordingly  market risk loss is primarily defined as the potential loss in earnings due to higher interest rates for certain debt of the company 
the modeling technique used by omnicare for evaluating interest rate risk exposure involves performing sensitivity analysis on the variable rate debt  assuming a change in interest rates of basis 
table of contents points 
among the company s debt obligations is million outstanding under the variable rate senior term loan  due  at an interest rate of at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million per year 
in connection with its offering of million of senior notes during and the additional million in  the company entered into swap agreements on all million of its aggregate principal amount of the senior notes the swap agreements 
under the swap agreements  which hedge against exposure to long term us dollar interest rates  the company receives a fixed rate of and pays a floating rate based on libor with a maturity of six months  plus a weighted average spread of 
the weighted average estimated libor based floating rate including the spread was at december  a basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately million per year

the company has operations and revenue that occur outside of the us and transactions that are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  exposing it to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  the substantial portion of the company s overall consolidated operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s overall consolidated cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
in connection with the preparation of these financial statements  omnicare management is required to make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates its critical estimates giving consideration to a combination of factors  including historical experience  current conditions  feedback from outside advisors where feasible  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the time and under the current circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in the description of business and summary of significant accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated 
table of contents financial statements at part ii  item  of this filing 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap and does not require significant management judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the determination of the registrant s financial position and operating results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
if actual results were to differ materially from the judgments and estimates made  the company s reported financial position and or operating results could be materially affected 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in general  omnicare recognizes revenue when products are delivered or services are rendered or provided to the customer  prices are fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products are reimbursed by the federal medicare part d plan and  to a lesser extent  state medicaid programs 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for sales and receivable balances at the revenue recognition date  to properly account for anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
since billing functions for a portion of the company s revenue systems are largely computerized  enabling on line adjudication ie  submitting charges to medicare  medicaid or other third party payors electronically  with simultaneous feedback of the amount to be paid at the time of sale to record net revenues  exposure to estimating contractual allowance adjustments is limited primarily to unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims typically approved for reimbursement once additional information is provided to the payor 
for the remaining portion of the company s revenue systems  the contractual allowance is estimated for all billed  unbilled and or initially rejected medicare  medicaid and third party claims 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms  and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contractual allowance estimates are adjusted to actual amounts as cash is received and claims are settled  and the aggregate impact of these resulting adjustments were not significant to the company s operations for any of the periods presented 
further  omnicare does not expect the effects of a change in estimate related to unsettled december  contractual allowance amounts from medicare  medicaid and third party payors to be significant to its future consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
patient co payments are associated with medicare part d  certain state medicaid programs  medicare part b and certain third party payors and are typically not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered  but are billed to the individual as part of the company s normal billing procedures 
these co payments are subject to the company s normal accounts receivable collections procedures 
under certain circumstances  the company accepts returns of medications and issues a credit memo to the applicable payor 
the company estimates and accrues for sales returns based on historical return experience  giving consideration to the company s return policies 
product returns are processed in the period received and are not significant when compared to the overall sales and gross profit of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts collection of accounts receivable from customers is the company s primary source of operating cash flow and is critical to omnicare s operating performance  cash flows and financial condition 
omnicare s primary collection risk relates to facility and private pay customers 
the company provides a reserve for accounts receivable considered to be at increased risk of becoming uncollectible by establishing an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
omnicare establishes this allowance for doubtful accounts and considers such factors as historical collection experience ie  payment history and credit losses and creditworthiness  specifically identified credit risks  aging of accounts receivable by payor category  current and expected economic conditions and other relevant factors 
management reviews this allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
judgment is used to assess the collectability of account balances and the economic ability of customers to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was million  compared with million at december  the allowance for doubtful accounts represented and of gross receivables net of contractual allowance adjustments as of december  and december   respectively 
unforeseen future developments could lead to 
table of contents changes in the company s provision for doubtful accounts levels and future allowance for doubtful accounts percentages  which could materially impact the overall financial results  financial position or cash flows of the company 
for example  a one percentage point increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross receivables as of december  would result in an increase to the provision for doubtful accounts and related allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
patient charges pending approval from medicare  medicaid and third party payors are primarily billed as private pay and  where applicable  are recorded net of an estimated contractual allowance at period end 
once an approval to bill medicare  medicaid and or third party payors has been obtained  the private pay balance is reversed and a corresponding medicare  medicaid or third party receivable amount is recorded 
the company s policy is to resolve accounts receivable with pending status as soon as practicable 
pending accounts receivable balances were not a significant component of the overall accounts receivable balance at december  omnicare has standard policies and procedures for collection of its accounts receivable 
the company s collection efforts generally include the mailing of statements  followed up when necessary with delinquency notices  personal and other contacts  the use of an in house national collections department or outside collection agencies  and potentially mediation arbitration or litigation when accounts are considered unresponsive 
in the fourth quarter  omnicare management decided to implement a different strategic approach for the resolution of past due accounts which are disputed and or currently in litigation 
in particular  this new approach includes a heightened focus on maintaining positive relationships with current and former customers  with a greater priority on settling outstanding accounts receivable disputes and the avoidance of litigation where possible 
as a result of this change in approach  the company believed there was an increased risk of uncollectible accounts receivable  and adjusted its provision for doubtful accounts accordingly 
omnicare s collection efforts primarily relate to its facility and private pay customers  as well as efforts to collect rework medicare part d copays and rejected claims 
when omnicare becomes aware that a specific customer is potentially unable to meet part or all of its financial obligations  for example  as a result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the national credit and collections department includes the exposed balance in its allowance for doubtful accounts requirements 
at such time that a balance is definitively deemed to be uncollectible  the balance is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the company does not have a significant portion of its overall accounts receivable balance placed in mediation arbitration  litigation or with outside collection agencies 
given the company s experience  management believes that the aggregate reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if any of the company s larger customers were to unexpectedly default on their obligations to omnicare  the company s overall allowances for doubtful accounts may prove to be inadequate 
in particular  if economic conditions worsen  the payor mix shifts significantly or the company s customers reimbursement rates are adversely affected  impacting omnicare s customers ability to pay their bills  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly  and the company s accounts receivable collections  cash flows  financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected

goodwill historically  goodwill has been reviewed at the reporting unit level for impairment using a fair value based approach at least annually or between annual tests if events occur or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
in  in connection with its annual impairment test  the company adopted the revised authoritative guidance regarding the testing for goodwill impairment which allows an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount then the company would perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  is a comparison of the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
the second step requires the company to calculate an implied fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level 
if the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
during the fourth quarter of  the company changed its operating segments  which resulted in two reportable segments  ltc and scg 
in connection with this change in operating segments  the company reallocated goodwill based on a relative fair value approach 
after completing this reallocation  the company concluded that the fair value of its operating segments were substantially above their carrying value 

table of contents the company s annual goodwill impairment analysis included an assessment of certain qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic  industry and market conditions  cost factors that have a negative effect on earnings  overall financial performance  the movement of the company s share price  and other relevant entity and reporting unit specific events 
the company considered the qualitative factors and weighted the evidence obtained and determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in  the company performed its annual goodwill impairment analysis under the previous guidance and  except for the cro goodwill impairment charge discussed at the discontinued operations note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  concluded that goodwill had not been impaired 
given the substantial amount of the excess of fair value over carrying value  none of the company s reporting units were considered to be at risk of failing step one of omnicare s annual goodwill impairment test 
although the company believes the factors considered in the impairment analysis are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
in prior years  the company s assessment of goodwill impairment was largely dependent on estimates of future cash flows at the aggregated reporting unit level  and a weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates of these future cash flows were based on assumptions and projections with respect to future revenues and expenses believed to be reasonable and supportable at the time the annual impairment analysis was performed 
further  they required management s subjective judgments and took into account assumptions about overall growth rates and increases in expenses 
taxes the company estimates its current and deferred tax assets and liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as well as the realization of deferred tax assets including those relating to net operating losses 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
omnicare periodically reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on the company s expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and omnicare s tax methods of accounting 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income by jurisdiction  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  or if the tax laws change unfavorably  then the company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  resulting in an increase in the effective tax rate and related tax expense 
the company also reviews its tax liabilities  including those relating to acquired subsidiaries  giving consideration to the relevant authoritative guidance  including accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of income tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under this authoritative guidance  recognition and measurement are considered discrete events 
the recognition threshold is met when it is determined a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is percent likely of being realized upon ultimate resolution with a taxing authority 
omnicare operates in a significant number of states and tax jurisdictions with varying tax laws 
the company is subject to both federal and state audits of tax returns in the normal course of business 
while the company believes it has provided adequately for tax liabilities in its consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by applicable taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on omnicare s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes is not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could potentially experience tax losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential tax gains 
a one percentage point change in the company s overall  and effective tax rates would impact tax expense and net income by million  million and million  respectively 

table of contents legal contingencies as part of its ongoing operations  the company is subject to various inspections  audits  inquiries  investigations and similar actions by third parties  as well as governmental regulatory authorities responsible for enforcing the laws and regulations to which the company is subject and including reviews of individual omnicare pharmacy s reimbursement documentation and administrative practices 
oftentimes  these inspections  audits  investigations and inquiries relate to prior periods  including periods predating omnicare s actual ownership of a particular acquired unit 
further  under the federal false claims act  private parties have the right to bring qui tam  or whistleblower  suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to  or improperly retain overpayments from  the government 
some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions 
the company from time to time receives government inquiries from federal and state agencies regarding compliance with various healthcare laws 
in addition  the company is involved with various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
at any point in time  the company is in varying stages of discussions on these matters 
each quarter  the company reviews  including consultation with its outside legal advisors where applicable  the status of inspections  audits  inquiries  investigations  legal claims and legal proceedings and assesses its potential financial exposure 
omnicare records accruals for such contingencies to the extent that the company concludes that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
to the extent the amount of a probable loss is estimable only by reference to a range of equally probable outcomes  and no amount within the range appears to be a better estimate than any other amount  the low end of the range is accrued 
these matters are continuously being evaluated and  in many cases  are being contested by the company and the outcome is not predictable 
the inherently unpredictable nature of legal proceedings may be exacerbated by various factors from time to time  including i the damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate  ii discovery is not complete  iii the proceeding is in its early stages  iv the matters present legal uncertainties  v there are significant facts in dispute  vi there are a large number of parties including where it is uncertain how liability  if any  will be shared among multiple defendants  or vii there is a wide range of potential outcomes 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these matters  the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and external factors beyond the company s control  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  omnicare reassesses the potential liability related to any pending inspections  audits  inquiries  investigation  claims and litigation and may revise its estimated exposure upward or downward accordingly  including any related disclosure 
such revision in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
