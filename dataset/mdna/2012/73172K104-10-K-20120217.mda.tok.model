the discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is also followed by a discussion of results of operations by segment for the three years ended december  gross margins increased percentage point in as compared to primarily due to higher services gross margins while product gross margins remained relatively flat 
services gross margins increased in all of our geographic segments primarily as a result of increased revenues from our maintenance services and decreased costs as a percentage of revenue associated with the delivery of service due to higher productivity of services employees  improvements in product quality and lower outside services 
operating margins increased in over primarily due to operating expenses decreasing and gross margin increasing as a percentage of revenue in as compared to the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from decreases in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue due to increased productivity of our sales force and lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 

table of contents during  we generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities which  after the impact of cash paid for acquisitions  share repurchases  and other financing and investing activities described in further detail under liquidity and capital resources  resulted in a million net increase in our total cash and cash equivalents 
during  we completed three business combinations 
on march   we acquired accordent  a privately held video content management and delivery solutions company 
on july   we acquired the assets of the hpvc business  including the halo products and managed services business 
on october   we acquired vivu  a privately held video collaboration software company 
the total net cash paid in on these business combinations was million 
we have included the financial results of accordent  hpvc and vivu in our consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition 
in june   our board of directors approved a two for one stock split of our outstanding shares of common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend the stock split 
the stock split entitled each stockholder of record at the close of business on june  to receive one additional share of common stock for every one share of common stock owned as of that date  paid by our transfer agent on july  the par value of our common stock was maintained at the pre split amount of per share 
all share and per share data have been restated as if the stock split had occurred as of the earliest period presented 
as adjusted for the stock split  our weighted average shares outstanding and earnings per share for the past five years are as follows year ended december  in thousands  except per share data basic net income per share diluted net income per share weighted average shares outstanding for basic net income per share weighted average shares outstanding for diluted net income per share moving forward into  we have developed a strategic plan that is designed to capture the emerging network effect of uc adoption by enterprise  public sector  service providers  smbs  mobile and remote employees  and social business users 
we believe we are uniquely positioned as the uc ecosystem partner of choice through our strategic partnerships  support of open standards  innovative technology and customer centric go to market capabilities 
central to our strategic plan are five strategic imperatives cloud based uc solutions  mobile uc solutions  focused ecosystem partnerships  realpresence platform an expansion of our former uc intelligent core platform  and growth markets 
we expect these strategic imperatives to drive our key initiatives and spending in

our net revenues  which include product and service revenues  for each segment are summarized in the following table year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands americas of revenues emea of revenues apac of revenues total revenues total revenues for were billion  an increase of million  or  over  driven by increases in both product and services revenues 
product revenues increased by million or  and services revenue increased by million or in as compared with 
table of contents the increase in revenues primarily reflected increases in revenues across all segments in as compared with  most predominantly in the apac segment  primarily as a result of investments made in our go to market capabilities which resulted in increased sales volumes while average selling prices remained relatively stable and to a lesser extent driven by revenue from the hpvc acquisition in the third quarter of our americas  emea  and apac segment revenues increased by million or  million or  and million or  respectively in as compared to these increases were driven by increased revenues across many of our key geographic markets  including the united states  china  brazil  germany  russia  india  the nordics  the united kingdom  and australia

product revenues increased by million or and services revenue increased by million or in as compared with the increase in revenues primarily reflected increases in revenues across all segments in as compared with as a result of investments made in our go to market capabilities and improved global economic conditions in which increased sales volumes  while average selling prices remained relatively stable 
our americas  emea  and apac segment revenues increased by million or  million or  and million or  respectively in as compared to these increases were driven by increased revenues across many of our key geographic markets  including the united states  china  france  germany  russia  singapore  the united kingdom  and australia 
in   and  one channel partner in our americas segment accounted for more than of our total net revenues 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
in addition to the primary view on a geographic basis  we also track revenues by groups of similar products and services for various purposes 
the following table presents revenues for groups of similar products and services year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands uc group systems uc personal devices network infrastructure total revenues uc group systems include all immersive telepresence  group video and group voice systems products and the related service elements 
the increase in uc group systems of million or in over was primarily driven by increases in sales of our group video and our immersive telepresence products and related services and  to a lesser extent  increases in revenues from our group voice products and related services 
while our uc group systems revenues have grown sequentially and year over year in  we have recently seen a slowdown in growth of our group video revenues  primarily in north america 
the increases in our immersive telepresence products and related services in  as compared to  were partially driven by the hpvc acquisition in the third quarter of the increase in uc group systems of million or in over was primarily driven by increases in sales of our group video and group voice products and services in all our geographic segments 
uc personal devices include desktop video devices  desktop voice and wireless lan products and the related service elements 
the increase in uc personal devices of million or in over was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop voice products in all our geographic segments  driven by the 
table of contents continued adoption of voip  partially offset by decreased revenue from wireless products 
while our uc personal devices revenues have grown year over year in  our uc personal devices revenues declined sequentially in the fourth quarter of and our quarterly year over year growth rate decreased to  driven primarily by lower revenues in north america 
the increase in uc personal devices of million or in over was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop voice products in all our geographic segments  driven by the continued adoption of voip 
network infrastructure includes our network infrastructure hardware and software products and the related service elements 
the increase in network infrastructure of million or in over was driven by increased revenues from our network infrastructure products in all our segments

cost of product revenues and product gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
cost of product revenues at the segment level consists of the standard cost of product revenues and does not include items such as warranty expense  royalties  and the allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
overall  product gross margins remained essentially flat in as compared to across all our segments 
overhead absorption costs and other cost of sales such as freight  warranty and royalties are not allocated to our segments 
overall  product gross margins increased by percentage points in as compared to  due to higher sales volumes  better management of overhead costs and increased use of ocean freight in which lowered the cost of product revenues 
overhead absorption costs and other cost of sales such as freight  warranty and royalties are not allocated to our segments 
product gross margin remained flat in our americas segment and decreased in both our emea and apac segments 
the decrease in emea segment gross margins was primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations in british pounds 
the decrease in apac segment gross margins was primarily due to a shift in product mix and increased discounting 
our december  finished goods inventory levels were lower than the december  levels and inventory turns increased from turns at december  to turns at december  the decrease 
table of contents in inventory and an increase in inventory turns reflect our ability to manage lead times in fulfilling orders 
inventory turns in the future may fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix 
our inventory turns may also decrease in the future as a result of the flexibility required to respond to the increased demands of our growing business and the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins cost of service revenues consists primarily of material and direct labor  including stock based compensation costs  depreciation  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
the majority of our services revenue is related to maintenance agreements on new product sales  as well as the renewal of existing maintenance agreements 
historically  services have had a lower gross margin than our product gross margins 
cost of service revenues and service gross margins included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
overall  service gross margins increased by percentage points in over services gross margins increased in all of our geographic segments primarily as a result of increased revenues from our maintenance services and decreased costs as a percentage of revenue associated with the delivery of services due to higher productivity of services employees  improvements in product quality and lower outside services 
our service gross margins generally experience some fluctuations due to various factors such as the timing of contract initiations in our renewals and the mix of service offerings 
overall  service gross margins decreased by percentage points in over primarily as a result of investments made to expand our professional services practice as well as an increase in the mix of professional services revenues as a percentage of our total services revenues 
generally  professional services have a lower overall gross margin than our maintenance services 
total cost of revenues and total gross margins overall  total gross margins as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage point in as compared to the increase in total gross margins was driven primarily by increases in our services gross margins  as discussed under cost of service revenues and service gross margins 
we expect gross margins to remain relatively flat in the near term  as compared to forecasting future gross margin percentages is difficult  and there are a number of risks related to our ability to maintain or improve our current gross margin levels 
our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue can vary significantly based upon a number of factors such as the following uncertainties surrounding revenue levels  including future pricing and or potential discounts as a result of the economy or in response to the strengthening of the us dollar in our international markets  and related production level variances  competition  the extent to which new services sales accompany our product sales  as well as maintenance renewal rates  changes in technology  changes in product mix  variability of stock based compensation costs  the potential of royalties to third parties  utilization of our professional services personnel as we develop our professional services practice and as we make investments to expand our professional services offerings  increasing costs for freight and repair costs  our ability to achieve greater efficiencies in the installations of our immersive telepresence products  manufacturing efficiencies of subcontractors  manufacturing and purchase price variances  warranty and recall costs and the timing of sales 
in addition  we may experience higher prices on commodity components that are included in our products 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pts pts sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions for our sales force  including stock based compensation costs  advertising and promotional expenses  product marketing expenses  and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs

sales and marketing expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased by percentage points but increased in absolute dollars by in  as compared to  due primarily to increased headcount and compensation related costs  including commissions 
sales and marketing headcount increased by from december  to december  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation and facilities allocations also increased as a result of headcount increases  as well as due to the expansion of our demonstration center capabilities in support of our go to market strategy 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by percentage points and increased in absolute dollars by in as compared to  due primarily to increased headcount and compensation related costs  including commissions and stock based compensation charges  as a result of investments made in our go to market strategy in which resulted in sales and marketing headcount increasing by approximately in over depreciation and facilities allocations also increased as a result of headcount increases  as well as due to the expansion of our demonstration center capabilities in support of our go to market strategy 
other factors contributing to the increase in sales and marketing expenses included increased travel and entertainment expenses and recruitment and training costs as a result of increased headcount  increased spending on marketing programs  and the reinstatement of annual merit increases and incentive programs in the third quarter of we expect our sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as a result of incurring costs to recruit and hire new sales and marketing personnel  and expenses will also likely increase in the future as revenues increase 
we will also make additional investments in sales and marketing in order to extend our market reach and grow our business in support of our key initiatives surrounding our strategic partnerships as part of our uc ecosystem and developing and marketing cloud based and mobile uc solutions  our realpresence network infrastructure products and other innovations that are expected throughout forecasting sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
marketing expenses will also fluctuate depending upon the timing and extent of marketing programs as we market new products and also depending upon the timing of trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses may also fluctuate due to increased international expenses and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues 

table of contents research and development expenses year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs  outside services  expensed materials  depreciation and an allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs 
research and development costs are not allocated to our segments 
research and development expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
research and development expenses increased in by million or  as compared to  and increased by percentage point  as a percentage of revenues  in as compared to the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased compensation costs associated with increased headcount and increased development expenses in support of our key strategic initiatives  including our strategic partnerships as part of our uc ecosystem  cloud based and mobile uc solutions and realpresence network infrastructure products 
research and development headcount increased by as of december   as compared to december  depreciation and overhead allocations also increased in over as a result of headcount increases and increased capital investments in support of our development projects 
research and development expenses increased in by million or  while remaining flat as a percentage of revenues 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased headcount and increased development expenses in support of our strategic investment plan 
research and development expenses also increased as a result of the reinstatement of annual merit increases and incentive programs in the third quarter of and increased stock based compensation charges 
we believe that innovation and technological leadership is critical to our future success  and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development to develop new technologies and products to combat competitive pressures  such as the new scalable video coding standard to address the device  application and network requirements of mobile  smb and consumer networks 
we are also investing more heavily in research and development as a result of increased business opportunities with strategic partners  mobile and service provider customers as a result of our key strategic initiatives in these areas 
we are also investing in key vertical markets such as the us federal government 
we expect that research and development expenses in absolute dollars will increase in the near term but will fluctuate depending on the timing and number of development activities in any given quarter 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue is highly dependent on expected revenue levels and could vary significantly depending on actual revenues achieved in any given quarter 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have from time to time taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  increase decrease from prior year in thousands expenses of total revenues pt 
table of contents general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation costs  including stock based compensation costs  professional service fees  allocation of overhead expenses  including facilities and it costs  and litigation costs 
general and administrative expenses are not allocated to our segments 
general and administrative expenses included charges for stock based compensation of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars  but decreased by percentage point as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to the primary driver of the increase in absolute dollars was related to the increase in headcount and related increases in compensation and other headcount related expenses  including increased overhead allocations 
this increase was partially offset by decreased expenses for legal and outside services 
further  in we incurred severance  legal and other costs associated with our ceo transition in may  which did not reoccur in general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars and remained flat as a percentage of revenues in  as compared to primary drivers of the increase were related to increased stock based compensation charges in over and severance  legal and other costs associated with the ceo transition that occurred in may general and administrative expenses also increased due to the reinstatement of annual merit increases and incentive programs in the third quarter of the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased legal fees and other outside services  and to a lesser extent  increases in headcount and headcount related expenses 
significant future charges due to costs associated with litigation or uncollectability of our receivables could increase our general and administrative expenses and negatively affect our profitability in the quarter in which they are recorded 
additionally  predicting the timing of litigation and bad debt expense associated with uncollectible receivables is difficult 
the increase in international revenues has resulted in longer credit terms and increased credit risk  which could result in an increased level of bad debt expense in the future 
future general and administrative expense increases or decreases in absolute dollars are difficult to predict due to the lack of visibility of certain costs  including legal costs associated with defending claims against us  as well as legal costs associated with asserting and enforcing our intellectual property portfolio and other factors 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts in the near term  but could fluctuate as we make investments in enhancements to our financial and operating systems and other costs related to supporting a larger company  increased costs associated with regulatory requirements  and our continued investments in international regions 
general and administrative expenses may also increase as a result of additional investments required to support our key strategic initiatives 
in order to control expenses in any given quarter  we have taken actions to reduce costs such as imposing travel restrictions  postponing salary increases  requesting employees to use paid time off or implementing other cost control measures 
such actions may not be able to be implemented in a timely manner or may not be successful in completely offsetting the impact of lower than anticipated revenues 
acquisition related costs we expense all acquisition related costs as incurred 
these costs generally include outside services for legal and accounting fees  and other integration services 
in addition  it includes the amortization of cash merger consideration over the vesting term related to the vivu acquisition 
we have spent and will continue to spend significant resources identifying and acquiring businesses 
during  we recorded million of acquisition related costs 
these costs were primarily related to our acquisition of accordent which closed on march   our acquisition of hpvc which closed on july   and our acquisition of vivu which closed on october  no such activities occurred in and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles in   and  we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  for amortization of purchased intangibles acquired in our acquisitions 
in addition to the amounts recorded as operating expenses in  and  we recorded amortization totaling million  million  and million  respectively  related to certain technology intangibles in cost of product revenues 
the increase in  as compared to  is primarily due to the amortization of purchased intangibles acquired from accordent in the first quarter of  from hpvc in the third quarter of  and from vivu in the fourth quarter of purchased intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives  which range from several months to eight years 
the amortization of purchased intangibles in remained relatively consistent with that recorded in  as there were no additions  impairments or changes to useful lives recognized during either or that would increase or decrease the amortization expense amount 
we evaluate our purchased intangibles for possible impairment on an ongoing basis 
when impairment indicators exist  we perform an assessment to determine if the intangible asset has been impaired and to what extent 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is conducted by first estimating the undiscounted future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
no impairment charges were recognized for all periods presented 
at december  and  the carrying value of our purchased intangibles was million and million  respectively 
the increase in the purchased intangibles carrying value from december  to december  was due to the acquisitions completed during the year 
restructuring costs in   and  we recorded million  million  and million  respectively  related to restructuring actions which resulted from the elimination or relocation of various positions as part of restructuring plans approved by management 
these actions are generally intended to streamline and focus our efforts and more properly align our cost structure with our projected revenue streams 
during management also completed the consolidation of our colorado facilities and began the transition of certain engineering and product management and related support functions in our andover  massachusetts facility to other locations in order to gain efficiencies 
restructuring charges relating to these actions primarily included costs for idle facilities and  to a lesser extent  severance and relocation costs for impacted individuals 
in october  management committed to a restructuring plan designed to better align and allocate resources to more strategic growth areas of the business 
these actions are primarily related to the reorganization of our global go to market and other organizations 
the restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately seven percent of our global workforce with the majority of the reductions taking effect in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  enabling the creation of new positions that better align with our strategic initiatives 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges totaling million related to these actions and we currently expect to record additional restructuring charges and make cash expenditures between approximately million and million through the third quarter of resulting from this action  primarily related to severance and other employee termination benefits 
in addition  we have approved plans to consolidate and eliminate certain facilities in order to gain efficiencies  including the combination of our headquarters and san jose  california operations into one location 
as a result  we expect to record approximately million in additional restructuring charges related to idle facilities upon vacating these facilities in the second quarter of 
table of contents in  these actions were designed to reallocate our resources to more strategic growth areas of the business and resulted in elimination of certain positions while enabling the hiring of additional positions to better align with the execution of our strategic initiatives 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on restructure costs 
in the future  we may take additional restructuring actions to gain operating efficiencies or reduce our operating expenses  while simultaneously implementing additional cost containment measures and expense control programs 
such restructuring actions are subject to significant risks  including delays in implementing expense control programs or workforce reductions and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or a decrease in employee morale  all of which would impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions 
if we do not achieve the anticipated cost reductions  our business could be harmed 
litigation reserves and payments during and  we recorded million and million  respectively in litigation reserves and payments in the consolidated statements of operations related to the settlement of legal matters during the periods 
there were no such expenses in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future and could result in charges that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  our results of operations  or our cash flows 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net  consists primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investments less bank charges resulting from the use of our bank accounts  gains and losses on investments  non income related taxes and fees and foreign exchange related gains and losses 
interest and other income expense  net  was a net expense of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income expense  net  in from was primarily due to a write down in of other than temporarily impaired investments  partially offset by a decrease in interest income  net 
there were no such other than temporarily impaired investments in the increase in net expense in over was primarily due to net losses realized on the sale of investments in  an increase in non income related taxes and fees in as compared to and the write off of a non trade note receivable in there were no such investment losses or non trade receivable write offs during the increase in net expense was partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses recognized in as compared to interest and other income expense  net  will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and returns on our cash and investments  any future impairment of investments  foreign currency rate fluctuations on un hedged exposures  fluctuations in costs associated with our hedging program and timing of non income related taxes and license fees 
the cash balance could also decrease depending upon the amount of cash used in any future acquisitions  our stock repurchase activity and other factors  which would also impact our interest income 
provision for income taxes our overall effective tax rates for   and were   and  respectively  which resulted in a provision for income taxes of million  million  and million in   and 
table of contents  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was due to a relative increase in foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates  an increase in us research and development tax credits  and an increase in the release of uncertain tax positions inclusive of related interest and penalties of million in as compared to million in  partially offset by us taxes accrued on the intercompany sale of intellectual properties 
similarly  the decrease in the effective tax rate in versus was primarily related to a relative increase in foreign earnings subject to lower tax rates  greater releases of uncertain tax positions inclusive of related interest and penalties in of million as compared to when we released million  and an increase in us research and development tax credits in as of december   we had approximately million in tax effected net operating losses  million in tax effected capital loss carryforwards and million in tax effected credit carryforwards 
the capital and net operating loss carryforward assets and tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in and  respectively 
included in the net deferred tax asset balance is a million valuation allowance recorded related primarily to net operating losses and credits in jurisdictions with a history of credits in excess of taxable profits 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
in  we recorded reserve releases of million  million of which was due to the resolution of multi year tax audits 
the expiration of statutes of limitation in both the us and foreign jurisdictions resulted in reserve releases of million  and million in reduction in reserves was due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
in  the california franchise tax board completed its audit of the and tax years 
the audit resulted in a payment of million 
certain other audit issues were also settled during the year resulting in the release of accrued taxes of million 
additionally  million in tax reserves related to the cost sharing of stock based compensation were released as an adjustment to stockholders equity  million in tax reserves were released due to changes in foreign exchange rates during the year  and million in tax reserves were released due to the expiration of statutes of limitation in both the us and foreign jurisdictions 
as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations 
we anticipate that the reduction would approximate million 
the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to tax expense in the period released 
we recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
our future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as changes in tax legislation  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof  the geographic composition of our pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  amounts of tax exempt interest income and research and development credits as a percentage of aggregate pre tax income  final resolution of the tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options and the issuance of shares under the employee stock purchase plan  and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we believe that our future effective tax rate may be more volatile as a result of these factors 
we are also subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our net income and financial condition  possibly materially

as a result of this change in presentation  the revenue and operating results for the prior periods have been revised to conform to the current period presentation 
this change in segment reporting had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets  income statements  cash flows or changes in shareholders equity for any periods 
a description of our products and services  as well as annual financial data  for each segment can be found in the business section of this form k and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the discussions below include the results of each of our segments for the years ended december    and segment contribution margin includes all segment revenues less the related cost of sales and direct marketing and sales expenses 
management allocates some infrastructure costs such as facilities and it costs in determining segment contribution margin 
contribution margin is used  in part  to evaluate the performance of  and to allocate resources to  each of the segments 
certain operating expenses are not allocated to segments because they are separately managed at the corporate level 
these unallocated costs include corporate manufacturing costs  sales and marketing costs other than direct sales and marketing  stock based compensation costs  research and development costs  general and administrative costs  such as legal and accounting costs  acquisition related integration costs  amortization of purchased intangible assets  restructuring costs  and interest and other income expense  net

table of contents americas year ended december  increase from prior year in thousands revenues contribution margin contribution margin as of americas revenues pts our americas segment revenues increased by in  as compared with  primarily due to increased revenues in the united states and brazil  partially offset by decreases in canada and mexico 
the increase in revenues was driven by increases in our uc group systems  uc personal devices and network infrastructure revenues 
increases in uc group systems revenues in the americas were primarily driven by increased group voice revenues  increased group video revenues  and increased immersive telepresence revenues 
increases in uc personal devices revenues were primarily driven by increased desktop voice sales resulting from continued adoption of voip  partially offset by decreased wireless product revenues and by decreased desktop video revenues 
network infrastructure revenues growth was as a result of increased sales of our realpresence products and services 
while our north america revenues increased in over  we have seen a decline in our quarterly year over year growth rates  including most recently in the fourth quarter of  where they were at the lowest level since the fourth quarter of we believe that this decline is primarily due to execution issues  and we have recently made changes to the leadership and structure of our sales organization that are intended to realign and optimize the region 
our americas segment revenues increased by in as compared with primarily due to an improvement in the economic environment  particularly in the united states  brazil  and canada  which resulted in increased demand for our products and services 
the increase in revenues was driven by increases in our uc group systems  uc personal devices and network infrastructure revenues 
increases in uc group systems revenues in the americas was primarily driven by increased group voice revenues  increased group video revenues  and to a lesser extent  increased immersive telepresence revenues 
increases in uc personal devices revenues were primarily driven by increased desktop voice sales resulting from continued adoption of voip 
network infrastructure revenues growth was as a result of increased sales of our realpresence products and services 
in   and  one channel partner in our americas segment accounted for   and of our americas net revenues  respectively 
we believe it is unlikely that the loss of any of our channel partners would have a long term material adverse effect on our consolidated net revenues or segment net revenues  as we believe end users would likely purchase our products from a different channel partner 
however  a loss of any one of these channel partners could have a material adverse impact during the transition period 
contribution margin as a percentage of america s segment revenues was in as compared to in the contribution margin as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points  primarily due to increased gross margins and a decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margins was driven primarily by a mix shift toward higher margin products in our realpresence network infrastructure product offerings and a decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenues 
direct sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of revenue 
the increases in absolute dollars were due to increased headcount and higher spend on marketing programs 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue was due to increased productivity of our sales force 
contribution margin as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate in while we implement changes to the leadership and structure of the north america sales organization that are intended to realign and optimize the region 
contribution margin as a percentage of america s segment revenues was in both and the contribution margin as a percentage of revenue remained consistent due primarily to flat gross margins and direct sales and marketing expenses  while increasing in absolute dollars  remained flat as a percentage of revenue

liquidity and capital resources as of december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
substantially all 
table of contents of our short term and long term investments are comprised of us government and agency securities and corporate debt securities 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our short term and long term investments 
we also have outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  the majority of which are in place to satisfy certain of our facility lease requirements 
our total cash and cash equivalents and investments held in the united states totaled million as of december   and the remaining million was held by various foreign subsidiaries outside of the united states 
if we would need to access our cash and cash equivalents and investments held outside of the united states in order to fund acquisitions  share repurchases or our working capital needs  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
we generated cash from operating activities totaling million in  million in  and million in the increase in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to higher net income and non cash expenses  decreased inventory  a smaller increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and a higher increase in accounts payable  other accrued liabilities  and taxes payable 
partially offsetting these positive effects were increases in accounts receivables  and deferred taxes 
the decrease in cash provided from operating activities in over was due primarily to increased inventory  prepaid expenses and other current assets  a higher increase in accounts receivable  a lower increase in accounts payable and to a lesser extent  an increase in deferred taxes 
partially offsetting these negative effects were increases in other accrued liabilities  non cash expenses and net income 
the total net change in cash and cash equivalents for the year ended was an increase of million 
the primary sources of cash were million from operating activities  million associated with the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan and million in excess tax benefit from stock based compensation 
the primary uses of cash during this period were million in acquisitions  million for purchases of property and equipment  million for purchases of our common stock  and million for purchases of investments  net of proceeds from investments 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  metric was days at december  compared to days at december  we expect to continue to experience upward pressure on our dso as a result of the increase in international receivables  which typically have longer payment terms 
dso could vary as a result of a number of factors such as fluctuations in revenue linearity  a change in the mix of international receivables  and increases in receivables from service providers and government entities which also have customarily longer payment terms 
dso could also be negatively impacted if our partners experience difficulty in financing purchases  which results in delays in payment to us 
our december  finished goods inventory levels were lower than the december  levels and inventory turns increased from turns at december  to turns at december  the decrease in inventory and an increase in inventory turns reflect our ability to manage lead times in fulfilling orders 
inventory turns in the future may fluctuate depending on our ability to reduce lead times  as well as changes in product mix 
our inventory turns may also decrease in the future as a result of the flexibility required to respond to the increased demands of our growing business and the sustainability of the global economic recovery 
cash used for purchases of property and equipment remained flat at million in compared to we expect our purchases of property and equipment in to increase due to our headquarters move  upgrades to our enterprise resource planning erp systems and continued support of our strategic imperatives 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which typically mature in one month  to hedge our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  and cash 
table of contents balances 
we record on the balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts and record any fair value adjustments in results of operations 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on contracts are recorded in interest and other income expense  net  offsetting transaction gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
additionally  our hedging costs can vary depending on the size of our hedging program  on whether we are purchasing or selling foreign currency relative to the us dollar and on interest rate spreads between the us and other foreign markets 
additionally  we also have a hedging program that uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro and british pound as well as operating expenses denominated in israeli shekels 
at each reporting period  we record the fair value of our unrealized forward contracts on the balance sheet with related unrealized gains and losses as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate element of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses associated with the effective portion of the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded within revenue or operating expense  depending upon the underlying exposure being hedged 
any excluded and ineffective portions of a hedging instrument would be recorded in interest and other income expense  net 
from time to time  the board of directors has approved plans for us to purchase shares of our common stock in the open market 
during the years ended december    and  we purchased approximately million  million  and million shares  as adjusted for the stock split  respectively  of our common stock in the open market for cash of million  million  and million  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to an additional million under the share repurchase plan 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the accounting for our common stock repurchases and the resultant accumulated deficit or related reduction to retained earnings  as applicable  included in stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had open purchase orders related to our contract manufacturers and other contractual obligations of approximately million primarily related to inventory purchases 
we also currently have commitments that consist of obligations under our operating leases 
in the event that we decide to cease using a facility and seek to sublease such facility or terminate a lease obligation through a lease buyout or other means  we may incur a material cash outflow at the time of such transaction  which will negatively impact our operating results and overall cash flows 
in addition  if facilities rental rates decrease or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these facilities  we could incur a significant further charge to operations and our operating and overall cash flows could be negatively impacted in the period that these changes or events occur 
these purchase commitments and lease obligations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements once goods or services have been received or at such time when we are obligated to make payments related to these goods  services or leases 
in addition  our bank has issued letters of credit totaling approximately million  the majority of which are used to secure the leases on some of our offices 

table of contents the table set forth below shows  as of december   the future minimum lease payments due under our current lease obligations 
there was no sublease income netted in the amounts below 
in addition to these minimum lease payments  we are contractually obligated under the majority of our operating leases to pay certain operating expenses during the term of the lease such as maintenance  taxes and insurance 
this table excludes leases expiring or subject to cancellation within twelve months subsequent to december  our contractual obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands minimum lease payments projected annual operating costs other long term liabilities purchase commitments year ending december  thereafter total payments as of december   we have million of unrecognized tax benefits compared to million at december  by the end of  uncertain tax positions may be reduced as a result of a lapse in the applicable statutes of limitations 
we anticipate that the reduction would approximate million 
the reserve releases would be recorded as adjustments to tax expense in the period released 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financing  debt financing or from other sources 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available at all or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us and would not be dilutive 
our future liquidity and cash requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the introduction of new products and potential acquisitions of related businesses or technology 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our process used to develop estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  stock compensation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have transferred  product payment is not contingent upon performance of installation or service obligations  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product or service is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
we generally recognize service revenues ratably over the service periods of one to five years or upon the completion of installation or professional services 
some of our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements related to most of these products through maintenance contracts 
when a sale involves multiple deliverables  such as sales of products that include services  the multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine the unit of accounting  and the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the other revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
channel partner programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for channel partner programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline or competition were to increase further  we may take future actions to increase channel partner incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
we accrue for co op marketing funds as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by estimated product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revision of the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly by assessing individual accounts receivable over a specific aging and amount  and all other balances on a pooled basis based on historical collection experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
delinquent account balances are written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
excess and obsolete inventory we record write downs for excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable 
table of contents than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
stock based compensation expense our stock based compensation programs consist of grants of share based awards to employees and non employee directors  including stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares  as well as our employee stock purchase plan 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
the estimated fair value of these awards  including the effect of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair values of stock option awards and shares purchased under the employee stock purchase plan are estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of performance shares is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant and assumes that the performance criteria will be met and the target payout level will be achieved 
compensation cost is adjusted for subsequent changes in the probable outcome of performance related conditions until the award vests 
the fair value of a performance share with a market condition is estimated on the date of award  using a monte carlo simulation model to estimate the total return ranking of our stock among the russell index companies for awards granted prior to and nasdaq composite index companies for awards granted in over each performance period 
changes in the underlying factors and assumptions utilized may result in significant variability in the stock based compensation costs we record  which makes such amounts difficult to accurately predict 
deferred and refundable taxes we estimate our actual current tax expense together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against these tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   we have million in net deferred tax assets 
included in the net deferred tax asset balance is a million valuation allowance recorded related primarily to net operating losses and credits in jurisdictions with a history of credits in excess of taxable profits 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results 
fair value fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an 
table of contents asset or liability 
as the basis for considering such assumptions  a three tier value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly  and level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which require us to develop our own assumptions 
this hierarchy requires us to use observable market data  when available  and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value 
on a recurring basis  we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  including our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts 
our cash and investment instruments are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using inputs such as quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
the types of instruments valued based on quoted market prices in active markets include money market funds 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
the types of instruments valued based on other observable inputs include us treasury securities and other government agencies  corporate bonds and commercial paper 
such instruments are generally classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
as of december   our fixed income available for sale securities include us treasury obligations and other government agency instruments  corporate bonds  commercial paper  municipal securities and money market funds 
included in available for sale securities are cash equivalents  which consist of investments with original maturities of three months or less and include money market funds 
the principal market where we execute our foreign currency contracts is the retail market in an over the counter environment with a relatively high level of price transparency 
the market participants and our counterparties are large money center banks and regional banks 
our foreign currency contracts valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and quoted pricing intervals from public data sources specifically  spot exchange rates  libor rates and credit default rates and do not involve management judgment 
these contracts are typically classified within level of the fair value hierarchy 
for more information on the fair values of our marketable securities and foreign currency contracts see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
business combinations we recognize separately from goodwill the fair value of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we may record adjustments retrospectively to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date 
we reevaluate these items quarterly and record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill provided that we are within the measurement period and we continue to collect information in order to determine their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
subsequent to the measurement period or our final determination of the tax allowance s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances will affect our provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill is not amortized but is regularly reviewed for potential impairment 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on goodwill impairment testing which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
although the new guidance provides for a qualitative assessment with regard to impairment  entities must still follow the preliminary steps to identify reporting units  assign assets and liabilities to those reporting units  and assign all goodwill to applicable reporting units 
we elected to early adopt this guidance in and such adoption did not have an impact to our consolidated financial statements 
polycom s business is organized around four major geographic theatres north america  central america latin america cala  europe  middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac which were determined to be its reporting units in goodwill was reallocated to these four reporting units as of october  based on our qualitative review of the company s financial factors  including our market capitalization and profitability  as well as macroeconomic factors  including size and growth of the market in which the company competes  it determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december  for reporting purposes  the company aggregates north america and cala into one segment named americas and reports emea and apac as separate segments 
as of december   the three reportable segments were also determined to be our reporting units 
for testing  the assessment of goodwill impairment was conducted by determining the fair value of the reporting units 
the company then compared the fair value of the new reporting units to the reporting unit s carrying value as of that date 
the fair value was determined using an income approach and a market approach which was weighted equally 
under the income approach  the fair value of an asset is based on the value of the estimated cash flows that the asset can be expected to generate in the future 
these estimated future cash flows were discounted at rates ranging from to percent to arrive at their respective fair values 
under the market approach  the fair value of the unit is based on an analysis of financial data for publicly traded companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business 
based on the results of these impairment tests  which indicated that the estimated fair values of each of the company s reporting units substantially exceed its carrying value  the company determined that its goodwill assets were not impaired as of december  we assess the impairment of other indefinite lived intangibles at least annually unless impairment indicators exist sooner 
we assess the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by us to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from several months to eight years 
we annually assess whether any impairment indicators exist on purchased intangibles with finite lives 
long lived assets  including intangible assets with finite lives  are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the assessment of purchased intangibles impairment is 
table of contents conducted by first estimating the undiscounted expected future cash flows to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the purchased intangibles and comparing this amount with the carrying value of these assets 
if the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts  impairment exists  and future cash flows are discounted at an appropriate rate and compared to the carrying amounts of the purchased intangibles to determine the amount of the impairment 
there was no impairment charge recorded in as no impairment indicators existed 
screening for and assessing whether impairment indicators exist or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred  including market conditions  operating fundamentals  competition and general economic conditions  requires significant judgment 
additionally  changes in the high technology industry occur frequently and quickly 
therefore  there can be no assurance that a charge to operations will not occur as a result of future goodwill and purchased intangible impairment tests 
private company investments we periodically make strategic investments in companies whose stock is not currently traded on any stock exchange and for which no quoted price exists 
the cost method of accounting is used to account for these investments as we hold a non material ownership percentage 
we review these investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that may indicate to us that an impairment exists may be a significant decrease in the market value of the company  poor or deteriorating market conditions in the public and private equity capital markets  significant adverse changes in legal factors or within the business climate the company operates  and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or projections and forecasts that demonstrate continuing losses associated with the company s future business plans 
impairment indicators identified during the reporting period could result in a significant write down in the carrying value of the investment if we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of impairment  net of recoveries  of these investments in interest and other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
during the years ended december   and  we did not record any such impairment 
at december  and  our private company investments had a carrying value of million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged 
for a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
we enter into derivatives only with counterparties that are among the largest us banks  ranked by assets  in order to minimize our credit risk 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income that will become effective for us beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
this standard eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
we elected to early adopt this guidance in  and such adoption did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we generally invest excess cash in marketable debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate debt securities  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates the principal amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets based on the short maturities of these financial instruments 
short term and long term investments consist of us and foreign government obligations and foreign and domestic public corporate debt securities 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict  particularly in light of credit market instability 
if the current market conditions deteriorate  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may realize losses on the sale of our investments or we may incur further temporary impairment charges requiring us to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we could also incur additional other than temporary impairment charges resulting in realized losses in our consolidated statements of operations which would reduce net income 
we consider various factors in determining whether we should recognize an impairment charge  including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the financial condition and near term prospects of the security or issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow any anticipated recovery in the market value 
further  if we sell our investments prior to their maturity  we may incur a charge to operations in the period the sale takes place 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of various magnitudes 
we model the effect of an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve 
this methodology assumes a more immediate change in interest rates to reflect the current economic environment 
the following table presents the hypothetical fair values of our securities  excluding cash and cash equivalents  held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps in thousands bps bps bps fair value bps bps bps foreign currency exchange rate risk while the majority of our sales are denominated in united states dollars  we also sell our products and services in certain european regions in euros and in british pounds and incur expenses in israeli shekels  which has increased our risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
while we do not hedge for speculative purposes  as a result of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure to the euro  british pound and israeli shekel relative to the united states dollar 
we mitigate bank counterparty risk related to our foreign currency hedging program through our policy that requires us to only enter into hedge contracts with banks that are among the world s largest banks  as ranked by total assets in us dollars 
as of december   we had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  million british pounds at  million israeli shekels at  million mexican pesos at  and million brazilian real at 
these forward exchange contracts hedge our net position of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances and typically mature in days or less 
as of 
table of contents december   we also had net outstanding forward exchange contracts to sell million euros at  and million british pounds at  and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
we also have a cash flow hedging program under which we hedge a portion of anticipated revenues and operating expenses denominated in the euro  british pound  and israeli shekels 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to buy million euros at  million british pounds at  and million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of less than days 
as of december   we also had outstanding foreign exchange contracts to sell million euros at  and million british pounds at  and to buy million israeli shekels at 
these forward exchange contracts  carried at fair value  typically have maturities of more than days 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the united states dollar  relative to our foreign local currencies  would have an immaterial impact on our results of operations 
we may also decide to expand the type of products we sell in foreign currencies or may  for specific customer situations  choose to sell in foreign currencies in our other regions  thereby further increasing our foreign exchange risk
