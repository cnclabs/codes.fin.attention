the company s fiscal year begins on april and ends on march unless otherwise noted  all references in this document to a particular year shall mean the company s fiscal year ending on march overview the company continues work on its three major contracts craft ramp test set  itats bench test set from the us navy  and the ts a upgrade from the us army 
these units employ tel s new proprietary technology  technology which is expected to give tel a competitive edge in the market for many years to come  and which will be the basis of new competitive products 
the three contracts represent potential revenues of approximately million over the next few years  depending on the number of production options exercised by the military see item  business 
the company s legacy products continue to be negatively impacted by weakness in the commercial avionics market and lower than expected government orders 
engineering development for the three new programs has also taken longer than expected due in part to customer required specification changes 
these delays have limited sales growth while engineering expense continued to be high as a result of the company completing the design of the units 
however  the company completed the fiscal year ended march  with revenues of  and a net profit of  while the company did achieve its highest historical sales and was profitable  these numbers were below expectations as a result of the delays in getting to full production on the three major programs 
net profits were also impacted due in part to a warranty reserve to correct issues seen in previously sold craft units 
as previously announced  the company is forecasting sharply reduced revenues in the first quarter of fiscal year period ending june  and a loss due mainly to a temporary hold in craft production shipments to correct issues discovered in prior craft deliveries and incorporate the final aims approved software configuration which includes several product enhancements 
tic has also experienced continuing delays in securing a production release on the ts a program from the us army 
tic has made several management changes to enhance its organizational structure and provide emphasis to the manufacturing stage of the company s development as it enters the production phase of its three major programs 
the company is working closely with the us navy and the us army to secure production releases on the craft and ts a programs

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued overview continued to support its rapidly growing business  the company completed its facility relocation to one branca road  east rutherford  new jersey 
the new facility is a modern one story structure that is approximately larger than our previous two story facility which the company had occupied for over years 
the new facility is outfitted with state of the art manufacturing and engineering work stations as well as updated communication and computer systems 
additionally  the company had a modest increase in rent primarily a result of the additional space 
at march   the company s backlog was approximately million  including the order for itats units in the amount of million for which a production order has not yet been released  as compared to approximately million at march  with the delays on the craft and ts a production in the current quarter ending june   tic s cash flow has been negatively impacted 
as such  the company is exploring various alternatives to secure additional short term financing 
this includes working with the government to secure progress payments on these programs 
the company is confident that it will be able to secure the additional funding  and once shipments commence  the company believes that it will have adequate liquidity  and backlog to fund operating plans for at least the next twelve months 
currently  the company has no material future capital expenditure requirements 
results of operations compared to sales for the fiscal year ended march   total sales increased  to  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
avionics government sales increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in avionics government sales is primarily attributed to an increase in shipments of the an upm units and initial pilot production units of the ts a test sets offset by a decline in sales of the an usm and certain other products 
government sales are expected to increase significantly in fiscal year as the company begins volume productions of the an usm and the conversion kits and new units for the ts a program 
avionics commercial sales decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
this decrease in sales from overhaul and repairs was partially offset by higher sales of the tr gross margin gross margin increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin percentage for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  gross profit dollars slightly increased as a result of increase in volume but was negatively impacted by the change in sales mix  and the higher production start up costs associated with the an usm as well as for the warranty reserve to correct issues seen in previously sold craft units 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared to continued operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march   as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  this increase is attributed mainly to higher professional fees  investor relations expenses  shareholder expenses and recruitment costs offset mostly by lower administrative compensation and outside commission expenses 
engineering  research and development expenses decreased  to  for fiscal year as compared to  for the prior fiscal year  the decrease is attributed to lower outside contractor and recruitment costs as well as lower purchases of materials and lower transfers of charges from other departments partially offset by an increase in salaries 
engineering  research and development efforts are attributed mostly to finalization of the ts a product and the transfer to manufacturing as well as assistance to manufacturing for the an usm product 
the company is also working on new products for both the commercial and government markets 
income from operations as a result of the above  the company recorded income from operations of  for the year ended march  as compared to income from operations of  for the year ended march  other expense other expense declined to  for the year ended march  as compared to  for the year ended march  proceeds from a life insurance policy of  and the gain incurred with the revaluation of warrants issued in conjunction with the loan to bca in the amount of  as compared to a loss of  in the prior year was partially offset by an increase in interest expense and the amortization of debt expense associated with having the bca loan in place for the full year as compared to approximately six and one half months in the previous fiscal year 
income loss before income taxes as a result of the above  the company recorded income before taxes of  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to a loss before taxes of  for the fiscal year ended march  income taxes for the fiscal year ended march   the company recorded an income tax provision of  as compared to an income tax benefit in the amount of  for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the income for the current period 
these amounts represent the effective federal and state tax rate on the company s income loss before taxes 
however  the increase in the tax provision for the year ended march  was affected by a change in the nj tax law which  in substance  lowered the nj income tax rate  which resulted in lowering the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset 
the company did not lose any future benefit  and the result is such that the company will have lower nj tax expense in the future 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued results of operations compared to continued net income loss as a result of the above  the company recorded net income of  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources at march   the company had working capital of  as compared to  at march  during the year ended march   the company had a net increase in cash of  the company s principal sources and uses of funds were as follows cash provided by used in operating activities 
for the year ended march   the company generated  in cash for operations as compared to using  in cash for the year ended march  this increase is primarily attributed to the higher net income from operations  an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in accounts receivable offset partially by lower change in inventories and the liquidation of progress billings 
cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended march  due to an increase in purchases of equipment 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended march  was  as compared to  for the year ended march  the company received proceeds of  from a life insurance policy and  from the exercise of stock options offset partially by repayment of debt and capital lease obligations associated with the move to our new facility 
in fiscal year  the company raised million in financing which was offset by financing costs and repayment to the bank of the line of credit 
at march  the company s backlog was approximately million as compared to approximately million at march  historically  the company obtains a substantial volume of orders which are required to be filled in less than twelve months  and  therefore  these anticipated orders are not reflected in the backlog 
in september  the company  pursuant to an agreement with bca mezzanine fund lp  borrowed million for five years 
see note to the financial statements 
on certain government contracts  the company can receive progress payments from the government  which allows the company to bill and collect a portion of its incurred costs on long term programs before shipment of units  thus helping to fund the costs of these programs 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources continued with the delays on the craft and ts a production in the current quarter ending june   tic s cash flow has been negatively impacted 
as such  the company is exploring various alternatives to secure additional short term financing 
this includes working with the government to secure progress payments on these programs 
the company is confident that it will be able to secure the additional funding  and once shipments commence  the company believes that it will have adequate liquidity  and backlog to fund operating plans for at least the next twelve months 
failure to secure additional financing and or commence shipments in the near term would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
currently  the company has no material future capital expenditure requirements 
there was no significant impact on the company s operations as a result of inflation for the year ended march  critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  the company applies its accounting policies as disclosed in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity used in the preparation of financial statements include revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to  or acceptance by customer  provided title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
provisions  when appropriate  are made where the right to return exists 
in certain instances  the company may offer the unit on trial basis 
the company does not recognize revenue until the unit has been accepted 
the company only offers product on a trial basis in rare instances  and  as such  no provision has been made at march  and revenues on repairs and calibrations are recognized at the time the repaired or calibrated unit is shipped  as it is at this time that the work is completed 
due to the unique nature of the itats program wherein a significant portion of this contract will not be delivered for over a year  revenues under this contract are recognized on a percentage of completion basis  which recognizes sales and profit as they are earned  rather than at the time of shipment 
revenues and profits are estimated using the cost to cost method of accounting where revenues are recognized and profits recorded based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date to our estimate of total costs at completion 
the ratio of costs incurred to our estimate of total costs at completion is applied to the contract value to determine the revenues and profits 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
the company also receives progress billings on this program  which is a funding mechanism by the government to assist contractors on long term contracts prior to delivery 
shipping and handling costs charged to customers are classified as revenue  and the shipping and handling costs incurred are included in cost of goods sold 
payments received prior to the delivery of units or services performed are recorded as deferred revenues 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued inventory reserves inventory reserves or write downs are estimated for excess  slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these estimates are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
while such write downs have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are based upon historical rates and specific items that are identifiable and can be estimated at time of sale 
while warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  future warranty costs could be in excess of our warranty reserves 
a significant increase in these costs could adversely affect operating results for the current period and any future periods these additional costs materialize 
warranty reserves are adjusted from time to time when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates 
for the year ended march  warranty costs were  as compared to  for the year ended march  accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based on customer payment and current credit worthiness  as determined by review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors credits and payments from its customers and maintains provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer issues that have been identified 
for the year ended march  approximately of the company s sales were to the us government 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectation and the provision established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to receive positive results 
income taxes deferred tax assets arise from a variety of sources  the most significant being a tax losses that can be carried forward to be utilized against profits in future years  b expenses recognized in the books but disallowed in the tax return until the associated cash flow occurs  and c valuation changes of assets which need to be tax effected for book purposes but are deductible only when the valuation change is realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefit which is not more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  future taxable income is estimated  considering the realization of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can also be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels 
in the event it was determined that the company would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period in which that determination is made 
conversely  if it were determined that it would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  tel would decrease the recorded valuation 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies continued allowance through an increase to income in the period in which that determination is made 
in its evaluation of a valuation allowance the company takes into account existing contracts and backlog  and the probability that options under these contract awards will be exercised as well as sales of existing products 
the company prepares profit projections based on the revenue and expenses forecast to determine that such revenues will produce sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that may affect its financial position or its results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  fair value measurement asc  to improve consistency in application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the standard is intended to clarify the application of the requirements  not to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting 
the guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income asc to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the standard eliminates the current option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendment requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendment does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
the guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the company expects the adoption of this pronouncement to not have a material effect on the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu 
asu creates new disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s rights of offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the disclosure requirements are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods therein  with retrospective application required  which will be our quarter ending june  the new disclosures are designed to make financial statements that are prepared under us generally accepted accounting principles more comparable to those prepared under international financial reporting standards 
the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
with the exception of the pronouncements noted above  no other accounting standards or interpretations issued or recently adopted are expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  operations or cash flows
