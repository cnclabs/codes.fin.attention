item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have accounted for the discontinuance or disposal of certain businesses as discontinued operations and have adjusted prior period financial information to exclude these businesses from continuing operations 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview during the past two year period  a significant portion of the growth in the us oil and gas industry activity has shifted from offshore operations to onshore 
led by the dramatic increase in activity in unconventional shale reservoirs throughout the united states  domestic onshore rig counts have increased significantly during this period 
this trend has coincided with the continuing impact from the macondo well accident in the us gulf of mexico  which resulted in increased government regulation over offshore oil and gas operations 
while the permitting delays affecting offshore drilling operations have been easing  offshore drilling activity levels in the gulf of mexico have been slow to recover and have only recently begun to trend toward pre macondo levels 
these industry trends have significantly impacted our businesses 
as evidenced by the unprecedented activity and revenue levels of our production testing segment  our us onshore businesses have capitalized on the increased demand for domestic services  particularly in the most significant shale reservoirs  including the haynesville  eagle ford  marcellus  and others 
our fluids division segment has capitalized on the increased domestic onshore demand for its products and services  particularly water transfer and treatment services for fracturing operations 
our compressco segment has also targeted these domestic growth regions for its compression based production enhancement services 
the continuing slow recovery of domestic offshore operations has affected our fluids and offshore services businesses  but activity levels are increasing 
however  the significant drilling activity for onshore shale gas reservoirs during the past two years  along with other demand factors  has resulted in declining prices for natural gas  particularly during the last half of and early following the sale of substantially all of our maritech segment s oil and gas producing properties during  the most significant direct impact on our revenues and operating cash flows resulting from decreased natural gas prices has been removed 
however  the current low natural gas pricing environment  plus the continuing strength of crude oil prices  has resulted in a new trend by the industry toward oil drilling  which could once again impact certain of our businesses 
the strong performance by our production testing and fluids segments contributed to our overall operating results for production testing segment revenues and profitability increased significantly compared to the prior year due to the increased domestic demand discussed above  although international activity increased as well 
fluids division revenues and profitability also grew primarily due to increased domestic onshore product and service demand  although this segment also saw growth internationally 
our offshore services segment reported increased revenues during despite a soft pricing environment in the us gulf of mexico 
the july purchase of a new heavy lift derrick barge enables the offshore services segment to have increased capacity to serve the sustained long term demand for heavy lift services  which we anticipate will continue due to the increased government regulation of offshore well abandonment and platform decommissioning that was enacted during compressco also reported increased revenues primarily due to increased sales of compressor units compared to the compressco segment s profitability was negatively impacted  however  by increased operating expenses during and by increased public company costs associated with compressco partners following its initial public offering during june increased corporate overhead costs were caused primarily by the recognized loss from liquidating our hedge derivative contracts  which we had used to hedge maritech s production cash flows 
maritech recognized significant gains on the sales of its oil and gas producing properties during  but generated a significant loss for the year due to excess decommissioning costs associated with its remaining well abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
our strong balance sheet was further enhanced during  particularly as a result of the sale of maritech s oil and gas producing properties as these sales generated approximately million of cash  net of adjustments 
this strategic disposition has also allowed us to focus our capital expenditure priorities on our core service businesses  including the purchase of the above mentioned heavy lift barge by our offshore services segment and to fund the capital needs of our growing production testing segment 
despite the sale of the maritech properties  we continue to utilize a significant portion of our operating cash flows to extinguish maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities 
we expended approximately million on decommissioning work performed during  and a significant portion of the remaining decommissioning liability is anticipated to be extinguished during the june initial public offering of compressco partners the offering generated approximately million of net offering proceeds 
approximately million of these offering proceeds were used to repay to us certain intercompany note balances 
following the offering  we own approximately of compressco partners  and we continue to consolidate this subsidiary as part of our compressco segment 
in addition to significant availability under our bank revolving credit facility  we had a consolidated cash balance of approximately million  although approximately million of the balance is on compressco partners balance sheet to satisfy its operating requirements as well as to fund quarterly distributions pursuant to its partnership agreement 
future demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry  particularly including the level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and natural gas properties 
the growth of certain of our businesses may become hampered by the current pricing levels of natural gas  particularly as compared to crude oil 
however  we believe that there are growth opportunities for our products and services in the us and foreign markets  supported primarily by applications for many of our products and services in the exploitation and development of shale reservoirs  increased regulatory requirements governing the abandonment and decommissioning work on aging offshore platforms and wells in the gulf of mexico  increases in technologically driven deepwater oil and gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  and increasing international oil and gas exploration and development activities 
our fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and marketing clear brine completion fluids cbfs  additives  and other associated products to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling  completion  and workover operations in the united states and in certain countries in latin america  europe  asia  the middle east  and africa 
the fluids division also provides a broad range of associated services  including onsite fluids filtration  handling  and recycling  wellbore cleanup  fluid engineering consultation  completion fluids additives and fluid management services  as well as high volume water transfer and treatment services for fracturing operations 
in addition  the fluids division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third party suppliers to a variety of non energy markets 
fluids division revenues increased during compared to primarily due to increased international cbf product sales 
domestic offshore activity levels continue to be impacted negatively as a result of the maturity of the producing fields in the heavily developed portions of the gulf of mexico as well as uncertain regulations governing offshore drilling activities following the april macondo accident 
offshore oil and gas drilling activity levels have recently improved  but are still below pre macondo levels 
this decrease in offshore activity has been largely offset  however  by increased domestic onshore operations  including increased revenues from frac water services 
we anticipate continued increases in industry spending in  particularly given the current levels of crude oil prices 
also  the division plans to continue to capitalize on the current industry trend toward developing unconventional onshore shale reservoirs  where demand for its products and services have significantly increased during the past two years 
our production enhancement division consists of two operating segments the production testing segment and the compressco segment 
the production testing segment generates revenues and cash flows by performing post frac flow back and well testing and by providing reservoir data necessary to enable operators to quantify reserves  optimize production  and minimize oil and gas reservoir damage 
the primary testing markets served include many of the major oil and gas basins in the united states  as well as in mexico and south america  northern africa  the middle east  and asia 
the division s production testing operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting drilling and completion activities in the markets where the production testing segment serves 
production testing segment s revenues increased in compared to  primarily due to increased demand in the united states  and particularly due to increased activity in unconventional shale reservoirs 
given the continuing increase in drilling activity  we anticipate that demand for our production testing services will continue to increase in compared to compressco generates revenues and cash flows by performing wellhead compression based production enhancement services throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the united states  as well as certain onshore basins in mexico  canada  south america  europe  asia  and other international locations 
demand for wellhead compression services is primarily driven by the need to boost production in certain mature gas wells with declining production 
compressco segment revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to increased sales of compressor units as well as an increase in demand for production enhancement services  particularly in latin america 
given the recent decrease in domestic natural gas prices  the near term growth of compressco s domestic service revenues during may be negatively affected 
our offshore division consists of two operating segments offshore services and maritech 
offshore services generates revenues and cash flows by performing downhole and subsea oil and gas services such as well plugging and abandonment  workover  and wireline services  decommissioning and certain construction services  including utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines  and conventional and saturated air diving services 
the services provided by the offshore services segment are marketed to offshore operators primarily in the us gulf coast region 
gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by bsee regulations  the age of producing fields  production platforms and other structures  oil and natural gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
regulations enacted during by the boemre governing the timing of abandonment and decommissioning of nonproductive wells and unused offshore platforms are expected to increase the demand for the offshore services segment over the next several years 
given the increased cost to insure offshore properties for windstorm damage coverage and to reduce the risk from future storms  some oil and gas operators  including maritech  are accelerating their plans to abandon and decommission their offshore wells and platforms 
offshore services revenues increased by during compared to  primarily due to increased abandonment and decommissioning work performed 
in july  the offshore services segment purchased a new  metric ton heavy lift derrick barge  which we have named the tetra hedron 
this vessel was placed into service during the fourth quarter of and significantly increases the offshore services segment s heavy lift capacity to serve customers with heavier structures 
the sales of almost all of maritech s oil and gas producing properties during have essentially removed us from the oil and gas exploration and production business 
during late  we elected to explore strategic alternatives to our ownership of maritech in order to conserve and reallocate capital to  and allow us to focus on  our remaining core businesses 
as part of this strategic decision  beginning in february  maritech began selling oil and gas property packages to industry participants and other third parties 
maritech is continuing to seek the sale of its remaining oil and gas producing properties during as a result of these sales of oil and gas properties  maritech s revenues during decreased by compared to and are expected to be minimal going forward 
maritech continues to perform a significant amount of plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning efforts on its remaining offshore wells  facilities and production platforms 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we base these estimates on historical experience  available information  and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectability of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
the fair values of portions of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for our judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and as changes in our operating environment are encountered 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
if an impairment of a long lived asset is warranted  we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the amount of future cash flows  the period over which these estimated future cash flows will be generated  as well as the fair value of an impaired asset  are imprecise 
our failure to accurately estimate these future operating cash flows or fair values could result in certain long lived assets being overstated  which could result in impairment charges in periods subsequent to the time in which the impairment indicators were first present 
alternatively  if our estimates of future operating cash flows or fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
although the majority of our impairments of long lived assets have typically related to oil and gas properties  during we recorded other long lived asset impairments of million 
given the current uncertain economic environment  the likelihood of additional material impairments of long lived assets in future periods is higher due to the possibility of further decreased demand for our products and services 
impairment of goodwill the impairment of goodwill is also assessed whenever impairment indicators are present  but not less than once annually 
beginning in  the annual assessment for goodwill impairment begins with a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
this qualitative assessment requires the evaluation  based on the weight of evidence  of the significance of all identified events and circumstances for each reporting unit 
based on this qualitative assessment  we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of any of our reporting units were less than their carrying values as of december  if the qualitative analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying value  the resulting goodwill impairment test would consist of a two step accounting test performed on a reporting unit basis 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to our estimated implied fair value of that goodwill 
our estimates of reporting unit fair value  if required  are imprecise and are subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of each business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into each business estimated fair value 
these estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors  including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment  which affects our overall market capitalization 
if we over estimate the fair value of our reporting units  the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated 
alternatively  if our estimated reporting unit fair values are understated  impairments might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amounts 
during the fourth quarter of  due to changes in the global economic environment which affected our stock price and market capitalization  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million 
we believe our estimates of the fair value for each reporting unit are reasonable 
as of december   our offshore services  production testing  and compressco reporting units reflect goodwill in the amounts of million  million  and million  respectively 
decommissioning liabilities maritech s decommissioning liabilities are established based on what it estimates a third party would charge to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites 
these well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities referred to as decommissioning liabilities are recorded net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the property 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech settles these decommissioning liabilities by utilizing the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
this practice saves us the profit margin that a third party would charge for such services 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any difference between our own internal costs to settle the decommissioning liability and the recorded liability is recognized in the period in which we perform the work 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual cost of the work performed is recorded as a gain and is included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liabilities whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liabilities have changed materially 
the amount of cash flows necessary to abandon and decommission the property is subject to changes due to seasonal demand  increased demand following hurricanes  regulatory changes  and other general changes in the energy industry environment 
accordingly  the estimation of our decommissioning liabilities is imprecise 
following the late issuance by the boemre of ntl g idle iron guidance regulations  the estimate for maritech s decommissioning liabilities increased significantly 
in addition  maritech has adjusted its decommissioning liabilities during and as a result of increased estimates  as well as a result of the cost of significant abandonment and decommissioning work performed during the year 
maritech recorded approximately and million of excess decommissioning expense during and  respectively  associated with work performed or to be performed on nonproductive oil and gas properties 
in addition  adjustments to decommissioning liabilities associated with productive properties were capitalized to oil and gas properties and contributed significantly to maritech recording approximately million of increased oil and gas property impairments during compared to the estimation of the decommissioning liabilities associated with the two remaining maritech offshore platforms that were destroyed during the and hurricanes is particularly difficult due to the non routine nature of the efforts required 
the actual cost of performing maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning work has often exceeded our initial estimate of maritech s decommissioning liabilities and has resulted in charges to earnings in the period the work is performed or when the additional liability is determined 
to the extent our decommissioning liabilities are understated  additional charges to earnings may be required in future periods 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects under contracts which are typically of short duration and that provide for either lump sum charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges  which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to lump sum contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
the estimation of total costs to be incurred may be imprecise due to unexpected well conditions  delays  weather  and other uncertainties 
inaccurate cost estimates may result in the revenue associated with a specific contract being recognized in an inappropriate period 
total project revenue and cost estimates for lump sum contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
despite the uncertainties associated with estimating the total contract cost  our recognition of revenue associated with these contracts has historically been reasonable 
our production testing segment is party to a south american technical management contract which contains multiple deliverables  including the delivery of equipment and the performance of service milestones 
while the contract provides contract determined values associated with each deliverable  the recognition of revenue is determined based on the realized market values received by the customer as well as by the realizability of collections under the contract 
the determination of realized market values is supported by objective evidence whenever possible  but may also be determined based on our judgments as to the value of a particular deliverable 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated generally and on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
such estimates of future collectability may be incorrect  which could result in the recognition of unanticipated bad debt expenses in future periods 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies  and historically our estimates of uncollectible receivables have proven reasonably accurate 
however  if due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required  and such amount may be material 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations  and many of these estimates of future operations may be imprecise 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our estimates and judgments associated with our calculations of income taxes have been reasonable in the past  however  the possibility for changes in the tax laws  as well as the current economic uncertainty  could affect the accuracy of our income tax estimates in future periods 
acquisition purchase price allocations we account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method  which requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and  in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired 
our estimates and judgments of the fair value of acquired businesses are imprecise  and the use of inaccurate fair value estimates could result in the improper allocation of the acquisition purchase price to acquired assets and liabilities  which could result in asset impairments  the recording of previously unrecorded liabilities  and other financial statement adjustments 
the difficulty in estimating the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities is increased during periods of economic uncertainty 
equity based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based payments of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate  and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire 
expected volatility is calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected option term 
all of these estimates are inherently imprecise and may result in compensation cost being recorded that is materially different from the actual fair value of the stock options granted 
while the assumptions for expected stock price volatility and pre vesting forfeiture rates are updated with each year s option valuing process  we experienced significant revisions during primarily due to the reduction in the workforce of our maritech segment 
prior to  there have not been significant revisions made in these estimates 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report

in particular  revenues from our production testing segment increased significantly due to increased domestic demand and higher activity in mexico 
in addition  fluids segment revenues increased due to cbf sales activity in the regions we serve as well as increased calcium chloride sales activity  primarily domestically 
our compressco segment reported increased revenues  due largely to increased sales of compressor units during the year  but also due to increased international and domestic demand for its compression based services 
our offshore services segment also reported increased revenues due to increased well abandonment and decommissioning service activity during compared to the prior year 
overall gross profit increased primarily due to higher profitability from our production testing and fluids segments  both of which reflect the increased demand for their domestic onshore products and services 
our offshore services segment also reflected increased gross profit  primarily due to the impairment of one of its dive service vessels during consolidated general and administrative expenses increased during compared to the prior year due to approximately million of increased salaries  benefits  and other employee related costs  partially due to increased headcount 
this increase was despite a million decrease in equity based compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses also increased due to approximately million of increased professional fee expenses  million of decreased billings to joint owners for maritech administrative overhead  and million of increased bad debt expense  primarily due to the reversal of million of bad debt expense during the prior year period 
in addition  insurance  taxes  and other general expenses increased by approximately million 
net consolidated interest expense decreased during primarily due to increased interest income resulting from increased cash investments 
consolidated gains on sales of assets increased significantly during  primarily due to the sale of maritech oil and gas producing properties  particularly the may sale of properties to tana 
consolidated other expense was million during and was primarily due to the million charge to expense upon the liquidation of commodity derivative swap contracts in connection with the decision to sell maritech oil and gas producing properties 
in addition  current year other expense includes approximately million of increased foreign currency losses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased other expense compared to the prior year period primarily due to a million premium that was charged during in connection with the early repayment of the senior notes 
our provision for income taxes during increased due to our increased earnings compared to the prior year period

this increase was due to million of increased cbf product sales revenues  as increased activity internationally  particularly in brazil  more than offset a decrease in domestic offshore activity and pricing 
domestic offshore activity levels continue to be reduced as a result of the uncertain regulations governing offshore drilling activities following the april macondo accident 
also contributing to the increased revenues was million of increased sales of calcium chloride and other manufactured products  primarily from our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
increased onshore domestic activity levels  particularly associated with unconventional shale reservoir markets  resulted in approximately million of increased service revenues  including increased revenues from frac water services 
our fluids division gross profit increased during compared to  primarily as a result of the increased gross profit from our chemicals manufacturing operations resulting from the impairment of the million carrying value of the division s lake charles  louisiana  calcium chloride plant 
due to the market pricing for calcium chloride and the uncertain supply of raw materials needed to operate the plant on economic terms  the expected operating cash flows of the plant were insufficient to cover the plant s carrying value 
in addition  startup costs and production inefficiencies during negatively affected the profitability of our el dorado  arkansas  plant 
while many of these production inefficiencies were mitigated during  we continue to seek ways to improve the plant s operating performance 
associated with these plant operational inefficiencies  in march  we filed a lawsuit in union county  arkansas  seeking to recover damages related to certain design and other services provided in connection with the construction of the el dorado plant 
in addition to the improved gross profit from our chemicals manufacturing operations  gross profit generated from the increased frac water and other services during more than offset the decreased gross profit from sales of cbfs  that were primarily a result of the decreased domestic offshore market 
fluids division income before taxes increased compared to the prior year period due to the increase in gross profit discussed above and an increase in other income  which more than offset the increased administrative costs 
fluids division administrative costs increased due to increased salary and employee benefit costs and due to increased professional fees

this increase was a result of increased domestic onshore oil and gas drilling activity  as reflected by rig count data 
in particular  the production testing segment is capitalizing on the increased domestic onshore activity associated with unconventional shale drilling in many of the regions it serves 
in addition  international revenues increased by approximately million  primarily due to increased pemex activity in mexico 
the increase in production testing gross profit during was primarily due to the increased domestic activity discussed above and the increased efficiencies at the higher activity levels 
gross profit on international production testing operations also increased during primarily due to increased profitability on a south american technical management contract 
production testing income before taxes increased due to the increased gross profit discussed above 
these increases were partially offset by increased administrative expenses primarily from increased salary and other employee related costs during the period 
in addition  the production testing segment reflected increased office and professional fees  as well as increased bad debt expense  particularly associated with the segment s libyan operations

to a lesser extent  service revenue also increased due to increased domestic demand 
compressco s continuing growth domestically could be negatively affected by current low natural gas prices 
in addition  international growth could be hampered by conditions in mexico  where customer budgetary issues and security disruptions have had a negative impact on activity levels during the past two years 
compressco continues to operate at reduced levels of fabrication of new compressor units for its service fleet and expects to do so until demand for its services increases and inventories of available units are reduced 
compressco gross profit increased during compared to primarily due to the increased sales of compressor units 
in addition  gross profit on international service revenues increased  particularly in latin america 
gross profit on domestic service revenues decreased despite the increase in revenues  due to increased operating expenses 
our compressco segment continues to seek ways to reduce its operating expenses in the future 
income before taxes for compressco decreased during compared to  despite the increase in gross profit described above  primarily due to increased administrative expense 
compressco administrative expenses reflect the increased professional fee expenses and increased administrative staff as a result of compressco partners being a separate public limited partnership and the allocation of a portion of our corporate administrative expenses to compressco partners pursuant to the omnibus agreement which we and compressco partners executed in connection with compressco partners initial public offering 
in addition  the compressco segment had increased other expense primarily due to increased foreign currency losses

these increases were partially offset by decreased cutting services and wireline activity  and the impact throughout of a softer pricing environment 
in addition  during may  we sold our onshore abandonment operations  although this sale is not expected to significantly reduce our revenues in the future 
in july  we purchased a new heavy lift derrick barge which we named the tetra hedron with a  metric ton lift capacity  fully revolving crane 
with this vessel  which was placed into service in the gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter of  our offshore services segment has significantly increased its heavy lift capacity  enabling us to better serve the gulf of mexico decommissioning market and to serve customers with heavier structures 
we continue to anticipate that the ntl g idle iron guidance regulations issued during will increase the future demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services to be performed by our offshore services segment 
approximately million of offshore services revenues were from work performed for maritech during  compared to million of such work during these intercompany revenues are eliminated in consolidation 
despite the sale of maritech s oil and gas producing properties  a significant amount of abandonment and decommissioning work remains for maritech  and a majority of this work is scheduled to be performed during gross profit for the offshore services segment during increased as compared to due to approximately million of impairments during  primarily from the impairment of the carrying value of the epic diver  a dive support vessel owned by our epic diving marine services subsidiary 
during  we determined that this vessel was no longer strategic to the segment s plan to serve its markets 
while the purchase of the tetra hedron heavy lift derrick barge is expected to generate increased profitability for our decommissioning operations going forward  gross profit for was decreased by approximately million for the due diligence  inspection  and start up costs incurred during prior to the vessel being placed into service during the fourth quarter 
overall segment profitability was also affected by a lower pricing environment during  partly due to increased competition 
offshore services segment income before taxes increased primarily due to the increase in gross profit described above 
in addition  offshore services segment administrative costs decreased primarily due to decreased salaries and employee related  office expenses  insurance  and other general costs 
offshore services segment income before taxes also increased due to the increase in other income  which was primarily generated from the sale of onshore abandonment operations during maritech segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit loss gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net gain loss on sales of assets other income expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations income loss before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue maritech revenues decreased significantly during compared to  due to the sale during the current year period of approximately of maritech s total proved oil and gas reserves as of december  the most significant sale of oil and gas producing properties was on may   when maritech completed the sale to tana of oil and gas properties that collectively represented approximately of maritech s december   total proved reserves 
as a result of these sales  decreased production volumes resulted in decreased revenues of approximately million 
in addition to the impact of decreased production  maritech revenues decreased approximately million primarily due to decreased realized prices of maritech s natural gas production 
maritech had previously hedged a portion of its expected production cash flows by entering into derivative hedge contracts and its contracts hedging its oil production extended through however  maritech s natural gas hedges expired at the end of maritech s average natural gas price received during was mmbtu compared to the mcf average realized price received during in april  in connection with the planned sale of oil and gas producing properties to tana  we liquidated the oil derivative hedge contracts 
as a result  beginning april  maritech s remaining oil and gas production cash flows are no longer hedged 
including the impact of its oil hedge contracts through march  maritech reflected average realized oil prices during of barrel compared to barrel during following the above mentioned sales of producing properties  maritech revenues are expected to continue to be minimal going forward 
maritech expects to sell its remaining oil and gas producing property interests during maritech gross profit decreased during compared to due to the decreased revenues discussed above  although this was largely offset by decreased operating and depletion expenses also as a result of the sales of properties 
although oil and gas property impairments also decreased approximately million during compared to the prior year  this decrease was partially offset by approximately million of increased excess decommissioning costs 
a large portion of the excess decommissioning costs recorded during was associated with properties not operated by maritech 
in addition  maritech recorded approximately million of insurance settlement gains during as a result of settlement and claim proceeds from hurricane ike damages 
maritech continues to perform significant decommissioning work on its remaining offshore facilities and platforms  and additional charges for decommissioning costs in excess of estimates may occur in future periods 
despite the decrease in gross profit discussed above  maritech reported a decreased loss before taxes during compared to due to approximately million million consolidated of net gains on the sales of producing properties during the current year period 
partially offsetting this increase in gain on sale was the increase in administrative expenses  primarily due to decreased overhead allocated and billed to joint owners on operated properties  caused by the sales of the properties 
in addition  decreased salary  benefit  and employee related expenses resulting from the decrease in administrative staff during the last half of was largely offset by retention and incentive compensation incurred earlier in the year associated with the sale of maritech properties 
in addition  maritech administrative expense includes an increase in bad debt expenses  primarily due to a prior year period reversal of bad debt expense 
corporate overhead year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages gross profit primarily depreciation expense general and administrative expense interest expense  net other expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are generally not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
however  in connection with the public offering of common units in our compressco partners subsidiary  on june   we began allocating and charging compressco partners for its share of our corporate administrative costs directly related to compressco partners activities 
corporate overhead increased significantly during compared to  primarily due to increased other expense which resulted from approximately million of increased hedge ineffectiveness loss 
this increased hedge ineffectiveness loss was due to the april liquidation of hedge derivative contracts  following the planned sale of a significant portion of maritech oil and gas producing properties  which resulted in a million charge to corporate other expense for hedge ineffectiveness 
in addition  other expense increased due to approximately million of decreased foreign currency gains and despite a million premium that was charged during in connection with the early repayment of the senior notes 
corporate administrative costs increased due to approximately million of increased salaries and other general employee expenses  despite approximately million decrease in equity based compensation 
in addition  corporate administrative costs also increased due to approximately million of increased insurance and tax expenses 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of decreased professional fee expenses

offshore services segment revenues decreased by million compared to the record levels of  which saw unprecedented activity and demand 
increased onshore oil and gas industry activity during contributed to the revenue increases by our production testing and fluids divisions  with the fluids division also reflecting increased sales of manufactured products from our new el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
maritech revenues increased largely because of higher realized oil prices  which include the impact of certain commodity derivative hedges which expired at the end of overall gross profit decreased primarily due to million of decreased profitability from our offshore services segment and due to significant impairments and other charges incurred by our maritech  offshore services  and fluids segments 
in addition  the gross profit of our fluids and compressco segments were also decreased compared to the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by increased production testing gross profit 
consolidated general and administrative expenses decreased as compared to the prior year due to approximately million of decreased bad debt expenses and million of decreased insurance expenses during the current year 
these decreases were largely offset by approximately million of increased employee related costs  including increased salary  benefits  contract labor costs  and other associated employee expenses 
in addition  general and administrative expenses during include million of increased professional fees  million of increased office expenses  and million of increased taxes  investor relations  and other general expenses 
consolidated interest expense increased primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest compared to the prior year period following the completion of significant construction projects  including the el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride facility and our corporate headquarters building 
consolidated other income decreased during compared to the prior year  primarily due to approximately million of decreased gains on sales of assets  million of decreased legal settlement gains  million of decreased foreign currency gains  and due to the expensing of a million prepayment premium on the repayment of the senior notes 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased earnings in an unconsolidated joint venture  primarily due to a million charge for an impairment of our fluids division european joint venture investment during in addition  we recorded million of decreased hedge ineffectiveness losses compared to the prior year 
we recorded a consolidated income tax benefit of million during due to our net loss for the period 
this compares to a consolidated tax provision of million during divisional comparisons fluids division year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in fluids division revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily due to million of increased product sales revenues 
this increase in product sales revenues was partially attributed to increased revenues from sales of liquid calcium chloride produced from our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant  which began production during the fourth quarter of product sales revenues also increased due to increased domestic sales volumes of clear brine fluids cbfs  particularly during the fourth quarter of domestic product sales revenues also benefitted from increased pricing compared to the prior year and due to a significant sale of bromide products during the first quarter of international product sales revenues also increased  due to improved oil and gas activity levels in certain of the foreign markets we serve and due to increased product sales from our european calcium chloride operations 
the increase in domestic product sales revenues during occurred despite the decreased activity and pricing on product sales to domestic deepwater operators as a result of the deepwater drilling moratorium  which was in effect during a portion of the year 
although this moratorium was lifted in october  delays due to permitting and increased regulatory requirements have continued to slow the return of improved demand in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
however  cbf sales volumes increased during the fourth quarter of  and this trend may indicate that activity levels are increasing going forward 
in addition to increased product sales revenues  service revenues increased by approximately million due to increased domestic frac water and filtration service activities 
despite the increased revenues  gross profit decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the significant losses from our domestic calcium chloride manufacturing operations 
these losses were primarily due to the million impairment of the division s lake charles  louisiana  calcium chloride plant 
due to the market pricing for calcium chloride and the uncertain supply of raw materials needed to operate the plant on economic terms  the expected operating cash flows of the plant were insufficient to cover the plant s carrying value  resulting in the impairment 
in addition  start up costs and continuing production inefficiencies have negatively affected the profitability of our el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride plant 
we continue to take steps to improve the operational efficiency of this plant 
partially offsetting the significantly decreased profitability of our domestic calcium chloride manufacturing operations  gross profit on cbf sales and completion services increased approximately million  due to the increased activity levels during the current year 
in addition  gross profit from the division s european calcium chloride manufacturing operations also increased 
income before taxes decreased compared to the prior year  primarily due to the decreased gross profit discussed above and due to an increase in general and administrative expense  primarily due to increased employee related costs 
this decrease in profitability was partially offset by a significant decrease in other expense as compared to the prior year when we recorded a million charge for the impairment of the division s investment in a european unconsolidated joint venture 
partially offsetting this decrease in other expense  other income decreased as a result of decreased foreign currency gains on the division s international operations 
production enhancement division beginning in the fourth quarter of  certain mexican production enhancement operations were reclassified from our production testing segment to our compressco segment 
segment information for has been revised to conform to the current presentation 
production testing segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the increase in revenues for the production testing segment was primarily due to a million increase in domestic operations  approximately million of which was recorded during the fourth quarter of this increase reflects the increase in domestic drilling activity 
in addition  international operations generated million of increased revenues 
approximately million of this increase was associated with a south american technical management contract 
increased international revenues were reported during due to increases in eastern hemisphere and brazil  and were partially offset by decreased activity and revenues in mexico  where customer budgetary issues  security disruptions  and regional flooding during the year have negatively affected activity levels 
the increase in gross profit was due to approximately million of increased domestic gross profit  which more than offset the approximately million decrease in international gross profit 
domestic profitability increased due to the higher activity levels and improved operating efficiencies 
while international production testing operations have historically generated higher operating margins than domestic operations  decreased activity and operating interruptions in mexico have hampered international profitability 
despite the increase in gross profit  income before taxes decreased primarily due to a million gain from a legal settlement which was recorded in the prior year 
this decrease in other income plus increased administrative costs was partially offset by the increased gross profit during the current year 
compressco segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the decrease in compressco revenues was due to million of decreased us compression service revenues  primarily reflecting the reduced us demand for wellhead compression services during we believe the reduced demand was primarily due to continuing lower natural gas prices compared to prices during previous years  as well as due to the impact of increased competition 
compressco s domestic activity levels have begun to increase during the last three quarters of  and fourth quarter of revenue levels were increased compared to the prior year period 
over the past year  many domestic oil and gas operators  including certain compressco customers  have responded to the lower gas prices by reducing operating expenses 
in addition  international service revenues also decreased by million  primarily due to decreased activity in mexico 
revenues from sales of compressor units and parts during decreased million compared to the prior year 
compressco has reduced the fabrication of new compressor units until demand for its production enhancement services increases and inventories of available units are reduced 
the decrease in gross profit was due to decreased demand domestically for compressco s products and services  as well as due to the above described decreased activity in mexico 
domestic profitability during was also affected by decreased pricing and certain non recurring operating charges during the year 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased due to the decreased activity  despite compressco s efforts to improve operating efficiencies 
the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit and  to a lesser extent  from increased administrative expenses  which were primarily due to increased salary and personnel related expenses 
offshore division offshore services segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before taxes and discontinued operations income before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue the decrease in revenues for the offshore services segment was due to decreased activity compared to the record levels experienced in the prior year period 
the decreased activity resulted in reduced utilization of much of the segment s fleet as compared to the prior year period  without taking into effect the addition of a leased dive support vessel beginning in june in addition to the decreased activity for certain of the segment s operations  overall pricing levels were lower during compared to the prior year 
during  the boemre issued ntl g  the idle iron guidance regulations  which require that wells located in federal waters must be permanently plugged within three years of becoming uneconomic to operate and that platforms and other infrastructure must be removed within five years of becoming uneconomic to operate 
we anticipate that these new requirements will increase the future demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services to be performed by our offshore services segment 
in addition  we continue to capitalize on the remaining demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services for the remaining offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by hurricanes 
a total of million of the segment s revenues during were performed for maritech  compared with million during the prior year 
these intersegment revenues are eliminated in the consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decreased activity and pricing  but also included the impact of decreased utilization and efficiencies compared to the prior year period 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the offshore services segment recorded an impairment of million to the net carrying value of the epic diver  a dive support vessel owned by our epic diving marine services subsidiary 
we determined that the vessel was no longer strategic to the segment s plan to serve its markets going forward 
in addition  the segment recorded additional impairments of approximately million during  associated with other non strategic assets 
the decrease in income before taxes was primarily due to the decreased gross profit discussed above 
increased general and administrative expenses include the impact of increased salaries and personnel related costs compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these decreases  other expense during included a charge for a million legal settlement 
maritech segment year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages revenues gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue general and administrative expense general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations income loss before taxes and discontinued operations as a percentage of revenue approximately million of maritech revenues was due to increased realized commodity prices during compared to the prior year 
maritech has hedged a portion of its expected future oil production levels by entering into commodity derivative hedge contracts  with certain contracts extending through  although contracts having a positive impact compared to market prices expired at the end of including the impact of its commodity derivative hedge contracts  maritech reflected average realized oil and natural gas prices during of barrel and mcf  respectively  each of which were significantly higher than market prices of oil and natural gas during the period 
much of the favorable hedged oil pricing impact was as a result of oil swaps that were liquidated during partially offsetting the increased realized prices  overall production volumes decreased during the current year period  resulting in million of decreased revenues 
this decrease was attributed to natural gas production interruptions and normal production declines during the period 
a portion of maritech s main pass area production was shut in due to third party pipeline issues and the lack of available transportation for production 
although total oil production increased compared to the prior year period  maritech s interest in the east cameron field will continue to have a portion of its production shut in until maritech completes the redrilling of certain wells from a newly installed platform to replace the platform that was toppled during hurricane ike in successful development efforts at maritech s timbalier bay field are expected to result in increased production going forward 
however  since late  as a result of our efforts to conserve capital and decrease our investment in maritech  we have significantly reduced overall acquisition and development activities  and the level of such activity is expected to continue to be decreased going forward 
in february  maritech sold a portion of its oil and gas properties  which will also result in decreased revenues going forward 
in addition  maritech reported million of decreased processing revenue during despite the increased revenues  maritech s gross profit for decreased significantly compared to the prior year due to several factors 
during  maritech recorded million of additional credits to operating expense for the collection of insurance settlement proceeds  primarily from the million insurance litigation settlement in december regarding certain claims associated with damage from hurricanes katrina and rita 
in addition  partly due to the issuance by the boemre of ntl g idle iron guidance regulations in the us gulf of mexico  maritech significantly adjusted its decommissioning liabilities as of december  largely as a result of these adjustments  as well as a result of the cost of significant abandonment and decommissioning work performed during  maritech recorded approximately million of increased excess decommissioning expense associated with work performed or to be performed on nonproductive oil and gas properties 
in addition  adjustments to decommissioning liabilities associated with productive properties were capitalized to oil and gas properties and  along with the decreased fair value of certain oil and gas properties  contributed significantly to maritech recording approximately million of increased oil and gas property impairments during compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increased operating expenses were approximately million of decreased insurance expense and million of decreased repair expense  primarily due to the amount of repairs performed during associated with hurricane ike 
maritech s pretax profitability decreased during compared to  primarily due to the significant decrease in gross profit discussed above 
in addition  maritech other income decreased due to gains that were recorded during on sales of oil and gas properties 
partially offsetting these decreases  maritech general and administrative expenses decreased  primarily due to decreased bad debt expense 
corporate overhead year ended december  period to period change vs change in thousands  except percentages gross profit primarily depreciation expense general and administrative expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before taxes and discontinued operations corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expense  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased during compared to the prior year  as decreased general and administrative expenses were offset by increased interest expense and other expense 
corporate general and administrative costs decreased primarily due to approximately million of decreased salaries and employee related expenses  which was mainly due to decreased incentive compensation 
in addition  general and administrative expenses decreased due to million of decreased office expenses  million of decreased insurance and taxes expenses  million of decreased professional fee expenses  and approximately million of decreased general expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased investor relations expenses 
largely offsetting this decrease  corporate interest expense increased due to a decrease in the amount of interest capitalized on construction projects during the period  particularly following the completion of the construction of the el dorado  arkansas  calcium chloride facility 
in addition  other expense increased  despite a million decrease in hedge ineffectiveness losses  due to the charge for approximately million in prepayment premium on the repayment of the senior notes 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   our liquidity position was significantly affected by several transactions 
the sales of substantially all of maritech s oil and gas producing properties generated total cash  net of price adjustments  of approximately million 
in addition  the sales of oil and gas properties allow us to prioritize our future capital expenditure needs toward our core oil and gas services businesses  as maritech exploitation and development activity historically represented a significant use of our capital resources 
maritech has retained approximately million of decommissioning liabilities as of december   associated primarily with non productive offshore facility and production platform assets  and we anticipate extinguishing the significant majority of this work during in july  we increased the heavy lift capacity of our offshore services segment with the purchase of the tetra hedron  a  metric ton heavy lift vessel 
the addition of this vessel  which was purchased for approximately million  should allow us to serve offshore services customers with heavier structures in the gulf of mexico 
also during june  our subsidiary  compressco partners  finalized its initial public offering  which generated approximately million of offering proceeds  net of offering costs 
approximately million of these offering proceeds were used to repay to us certain intercompany note balances 
following the offering  in which we retained an approximate ownership  we continue to consolidate compressco partners as part of our compressco segment in our consolidated financial statements  however  separate cash balances are now maintained by compressco partners to satisfy its operating requirements as well as to fund quarterly distributions pursuant to its partnership agreement 
as of december   we had consolidated cash of approximately million  approximately million of which is held by compressco partners and is unavailable for our general purposes 
besides cash available  we also have approximately million of minimum available borrowing capacity under our bank revolving credit facility  which does not include the additional million available under compressco partners facility 
additional capital resources are also available to us in the form of additional debt borrowings  equity issuances  or other sources of capital 
this liquidity and access to capital resources allows us to consider funding additional capital expenditure projects as well as potential acquisition transactions  as opportunities become available 
operating activities cash flows generated by operating activities totaled approximately million during compared to million during  a decrease of 
approximately million of the operating cash flows were generated from insurance settlements and claims proceeds from a portion of maritech s insurance coverage related to damages suffered from hurricane ike during the remaining decrease in operating cash flows compared to was due to decreased earnings  excluding the gains on sales of assets and depreciation expense  during during the past three year period ended december   our operating cash flows have been affected by the significant and increasing amount of decommissioning work performed by maritech on its offshore oil and gas production facilities and platforms 
during the three year period ended december   maritech expended approximately million on well abandonment and decommissioning work performed 
as of december   and following the sale of substantially all of maritech s producing oil and gas properties  the estimated third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liabilities totals million as of december   and our future operating cash flow will continue to be affected by the actual timing and amount of these decommissioning expenditures 
approximately million of the cash outflow necessary to extinguish maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities is expected to occur during maritech s decommissioning liabilities relate primarily to the remaining inventory of abandonment and decommissioning work  including an estimated profit margin  to be completed primarily over the next two years 
our offshore services segment is expected to perform a majority of this work 
the amount and timing of the cash outflows associated with all of maritech s remaining decommissioning liabilities are estimated based on expected costs and project scheduling 
such estimates are imprecise and subject to change due to changing cost estimates  further changes to bsee requirements  commodity prices  and other factors 
in some cases  the previous owners of the properties that were acquired by maritech are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  which partially offsets maritech s future expenditures 
maritech s estimated decommissioning liabilities are net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
as of december   maritech s total decommissioning obligation is approximately million and consists of maritech s total liability of million plus approximately million of such contractual reimbursement arrangements with the previous owners 
an additional million of such contractual reimbursement arrangements as of december   is classified as receivable assets related to amounts waiting to be invoiced and collected 
offshore well abandonment and decommissioning operations in the us gulf of mexico are governed by ntl g idle iron guidance regulation  which requires that wells must be plugged within three years of becoming uneconomic to operate 
previously  the requirement was to perform this work after the last well in a field was depleted 
in october  the boemre s responsibilities were divided between the boem and the bsee  which will oversee the provisions of the idle iron guidance 
these idle iron guidance requirements are expected to increase the future demand for the abandonment and decommissioning services of our offshore services segment 
while the overall global economy continues to be difficult to predict  industry rig count and other data indicates that domestic oil and gas industry spending is increasing  spurred by the current strong pricing for crude oil and the recent trends for onshore shale exploitation 
demand for a large portion of our products and services is driven by oil and gas drilling and production activity  which is affected by oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
in particular  our production testing and fluids segments reported increased onshore domestic activity levels during compared to we are anticipating similar continued strong revenues and cash flows for these businesses going forward into during the past three years  maritech has performed an extensive amount of well intervention  abandonment  decommissioning  debris removal  and platform construction associated with six offshore platforms that were destroyed by hurricanes rita and ike during and  respectively 
as of december   maritech has remaining work associated with two of the downed platforms 
the estimated cost to perform the remaining abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal is approximately million net to our interest before any insurance recoveries 
due to the unique nature of the remaining work to be performed  actual costs could greatly exceed these estimates and  depending on the nature of any excess costs incurred  could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
all of this amount has been accrued as part of maritech s decommissioning liabilities 
maritech has additional maximum remaining insurance coverage available of approximately million  all of which relates to hurricane ike  although a portion of this coverage may not be utilized 
one of the underwriters associated with our windstorm insurance coverage for hurricane ike damages has contested whether certain repair costs incurred are covered costs under the policy 
during december  we initiated legal proceedings against this underwriter in an attempt to collect the amount of claim reimbursements provided for under the policy 
the timing of the collection of any future reimbursements is beyond our control  and we will continue to use a significant amount of our working capital until such reimbursements are received 
the explosion and subsequent oil spill at the macondo well evidences the general operating risks associated with offshore oil and gas activities 
we are subject to operating hazards normally associated with oilfield service industry operations and  to a lesser extent  offshore oil and gas production operations  including fires  explosions  blowouts  cratering  mechanical problems  abnormally pressured formations  and environmental accidents 
we maintain various types of business insurance that would be applicable in the event of an explosion or other catastrophic event involving our offshore operations 
this insurance includes third party liability  workers compensation and employers liability  general liability  vessel pollution liability  and operational risk coverage for our maritech oil and gas properties  including removal of debris  operator s extra expense  control of well  and pollution and clean up coverage 
our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery 
additionally  our insurance is subject to certain exclusions and limitations 
we believe our policy of insuring against such risks  as well as the levels of insurance we maintain  is typical in the industry 
in addition  we provide services and products in the offshore gulf of mexico generally pursuant to agreements that create insurance and indemnity obligations for both parties 
our maritech subsidiary maintains a formalized oil spill response plan that it submits to bsee 
maritech has designated employees and third party contracts in place to ensure that resources are available as required in the event of an environmental accident 
while it is impossible to anticipate every potential accident or incident involving our offshore operations  we believe we have taken appropriate steps to mitigate the potential impact of such an event on the environment in the regions in which we operate 
investing activities during  we generated million of cash flows from investing activities  due to approximately million of proceeds received from asset sales  primarily from sales of maritech oil and gas producing properties 
maritech has represented a significant portion of our capital expenditures historically  and with the sale of these maritech properties  we have focused our investing activities on our existing businesses and on potential acquisitions 
during  we expended million of cash capital expenditures  and this amount included an increase in capital expenditures for each of our segments  other than maritech  compared to the prior year 
this increase in capital expenditures reflects the anticipated growth for each of our segments  other than maritech 
in july  we purchased a heavy lift derrick barge with a  metric ton lift capacity  fully revolving crane for approximately million 
additional costs were also incurred for inspecting  transporting  and outfitting the barge prior to placing it into service in november this asset purchase significantly expanded the capability of our offshore services segment and enables us to serve customers with heavier structures in the gulf of mexico 
the recent growth in our production testing segment s operations has resulted in plans to purchase significant additional equipment needed to serve the growing needs of our customers 
this expenditure program is underway and expected to continue into our capital expenditure plans have been  and  for certain of our businesses  will continue to be  reviewed carefully  and a significant amount of planned capital expenditure activity may be deferred until activity levels increase 
our compressco segment continues to operate at reduced levels of fabrication of new compressor units and expects to do so until demand for its services increases and inventories of available compressor units are reduced 
during  our cash capital expenditures totaled approximately million 
approximately million of our capital expenditures was expended by our fluids division  the majority of which related to the purchase of new equipment to support its growing onshore completion services business 
our production enhancement division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million by the production testing segment to add to or replace a portion of its production testing equipment fleet and approximately million by the compressco segment for customized compressor units to be sold  along with general infrastructure needs 
our offshore division expended approximately million  consisting of approximately million of expenditures by its offshore services segment  primarily for the heavy lift barge discussed above 
in addition  the offshore division expended approximately million of development expenditures for maritech prior to the sale of substantially all of its oil and gas properties 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million 
generally  a significant majority of our planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses other than maritech  however  certain of these expenditures may be postponed or cancelled in our continuing efforts to conserve capital 
we plan to expend over million on total capital expenditures during the deferral of certain capital projects  such as the additional replacement or upgrading of vessels in our offshore services fleet  could affect our ability to compete in the future 
our long term growth strategy also continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions or opportunities to expand operations in oil and gas service markets 
to the extent we consummate a significant transaction  our liquidity position will be affected 
financing activities to fund our capital and working capital requirements  we may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities as needed from long term borrowings  short term borrowings  equity issuances  and other sources of capital 
our bank credit facilities we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks pursuant to a credit facility agreement that was most recently amended in october the credit agreement 
as of february   we did not have any outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility  although we had million of letters of credit and guarantees against the million availability under the revolving credit facility  leaving a net availability of million 
in addition  the amended credit facility agreement allows us to increase the facility by million up to a million limit upon the agreement of the lenders and the satisfaction of certain conditions 
under the credit agreement  which matures on october   the revolving credit facility is unsecured and guaranteed by certain of our material us subsidiaries excluding compressco 
borrowings generally bear interest at the british bankers association libor rate plus to  depending on one of our financial ratios 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on unused portions of the facility 
the credit agreement contains customary covenants and other restrictions  including certain financial ratio covenants involving our levels of debt and interest cost compared to a defined measure of our operating cash flows over a twelve month period 
in addition  the credit agreement includes limitations on aggregate asset sales  individual acquisitions  and aggregate annual acquisitions and capital expenditures 
access to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our ability to comply with the financial ratio covenants set forth in the credit agreement  as discussed above 
significant deterioration of the financial ratios could result in a default under the credit agreement and  if not remedied  could result in termination of the agreement and acceleration of any outstanding balances 
in june  associated with the contribution of the majority of the operations and related assets and liabilities of our compressco segment into compressco partners  compressco partners was designated as an unrestricted subsidiary and is no longer a borrower or a guarantor under our bank credit facility 
the credit agreement also includes cross default provisions relating to any other indebtedness greater than a defined amount 
if any such indebtedness is not paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner  a default will occur under the credit agreement 
our credit agreement also contains a covenant that restricts us from paying dividends in the event of a default or if such payment would result in an event of default 
we are in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our credit agreement as of december  our continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate cash flow 
historically  our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants and we expect this trend to continue 
compressco partners bank credit facility on june   compressco partners entered into a new credit agreement the partnership credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na under the partnership credit agreement  compressco partners  along with certain of its subsidiaries  are named as borrowers  and all of its existing and future  direct and indirect  domestic subsidiaries are guarantors 
we are not a borrower or a guarantor under the partnership credit agreement 
the partnership credit agreement includes borrowing capacity of million less million that is required to be set aside as a reserve that cannot be borrowed that is available for letters of credit with a sublimit of million and an uncommitted million expansion feature 
the partnership credit agreement may be used to fund compressco partners working capital needs  letters of credit  and for general partnership purposes  including capital expenditures and potential future acquisitions 
so long as compressco partners is not in default  the partnership credit agreement could also be used to fund compressco partners quarterly distributions 
borrowings under the partnership credit agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions  including the absence of a default 
as of december   there is no balance outstanding under the partnership credit agreement 
the maturity date of the partnership credit agreement is june  all obligations under the partnership credit agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured  subject to certain exceptions  by a first lien security interest in substantially all of the assets excluding real property of compressco partners and its existing and future  direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries  and all of the capital stock of its existing and future  direct and indirect subsidiaries limited  in the case of foreign subsidiaries  to of the capital stock of first tier foreign subsidiaries 
borrowings under the partnership credit agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to  at compressco partners option  either a libor adjusted to reflect any required bank reserves for an interest period equal to one  two  three  or six months as we select plus a margin of per annum or b a base rate determined by reference to the highest of the prime rate of interest announced from time to time by jpmorgan chase bank  na or libor adjusted to reflect any required bank reserves for a one month interest period on such day plus per annum

other sources in addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facility  we fund our short term liquidity requirements from cash generated by operations  from short term vendor financing and  to a lesser extent  from leasing with institutional leasing companies 
should additional capital be required  we believe that we have the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
however  instability or volatility in the capital markets at the times we need to access capital may affect the cost of capital and the ability to raise capital for an indeterminable length of time 
as discussed above  our credit agreement matures in and our senior notes mature at various dates between april and december the replacement of these capital sources at similar or more favorable terms is not certain

product purchase obligations in the normal course of our fluids division operations  we enter into supply agreements with certain manufacturers of various raw materials and finished products 
some of these agreements have terms and conditions that specify a minimum or maximum level of purchases over the term of the agreement 
other agreements require us to purchase the entire output of the raw material or finished product produced by the manufacturer 
our purchase obligations under these agreements apply only with regard to raw materials and finished products that meet specifications set forth in the agreements 
we recognize a liability for the purchase of such products at the time we receive them 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the fixed and determinable portion of the purchase obligation pursuant to our fluids division s supply agreements was approximately million  extending through other contingencies related to its remaining oil and gas property decommissioning liabilities  our maritech subsidiary estimates the third party fair values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any amounts contractually agreed to be paid in the future by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  previous owners of acquired oil and gas properties are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as such work is performed 
as of december   maritech s decommissioning liabilities are net of approximately million for such future reimbursements from these previous owners 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due total thereafter in thousands long term debt interest on debt purchase obligations decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations operating and capital leases total contractual cash obligations we have estimated the timing of these payments for decommissioning liabilities based upon our plans and the plans of outside operators  which are subject to many changing variables  including the estimated life of the producing oil and gas properties  which is affected by changing oil and gas commodity prices 
the amounts shown represent the undiscounted obligation as of december  amounts exclude other long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that do not have known payment streams 
these excluded amounts include approximately million of liabilities under fasb codification topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlements 
see note f income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
approximately million of the amounts expected to be paid in represent well abandonment  decommissioning  and debris removal related to offshore platforms destroyed in the and hurricanes 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb published accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic  testing goodwill for impairment asu  which simplifies how entities test goodwill for impairment 
the amendments in asu permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in topic the asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb published asu  comprehensive income topic  presentation of comprehensive income asu  which has the objective of improving the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and increasing the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
as part of asu  the fasb decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity  among other amendments in this asu 
the amendments require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments in this asu are to be effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and the amendments are to be applied retrospectively 
in december  with the issuance of asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standard update no 
 the fasb announced that it has deferred certain aspects of asu the adoption of the accounting and disclosure requirements of this asu is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb published asu  fair value measurement topic fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  whereby the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb aligned their definitions of fair value such that their fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are the same except for minor differences in wording and style 
the boards concluded that the amendments in this asu will improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this asu are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december   and are to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of the accounting and disclosure requirements of this asu will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk any balances outstanding under the floating rate portion of our bank credit facility or compressco partners bank credit facility are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates 
we borrow funds pursuant to our bank credit facility as necessary to fund our capital expenditure requirements and certain acquisitions 
compressco partners bank credit facility is available to fund its working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions  and other general partnership purposes 
these instruments carry interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above libor 
we had no balance outstanding under either bank credit facility as of december  accordingly  as of that date  there are no long term debt obligations which bear a variable rate of interest 
exchange rate risk we are exposed to fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro with regard to our euro denominated operating activities 
as of december   we have no currency hedge for our euro denominated operations 
in our european operations  we continue to have exposure related to revenues  expenses  operating receivables  and payables denominated in euros  as well as other currencies  however  such transactions are not pursuant to long term contract terms  and the amount of such foreign currency exposure is not determinable or considered material 
we also have operations in other foreign countries  particularly in brazil and mexico  in which we have exposure to the fluctuation between the local currencies in those markets and the us dollar 
we currently have no hedges in place with regard to these currencies 
commodity price risk we have market risk exposure in the pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices in the us natural gas market 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such price volatility is expected to continue 
our risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of our oil and gas production 
in april  in connection with the anticipated plans to sell maritech s remaining oil and gas properties  we liquidated the derivative swap financial instruments that were designated as hedges of maritech s future oil production 
as a result  until maritech s remaining oil and gas properties are sold  we are exposed to the commodity price risk associated with the remaining oil and natural gas production that we continue to own following the sales 
due to the minimal amount of expected production following the sales  such commodity price risk exposure is not expected to be significant 
fasb codification topic  derivatives and hedging  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
as of december   we had the following cash flow hedging swap contracts outstanding relating to a portion of our maritech subsidiary s oil and gas production commodity contracts aggregate daily volume weighted average contract price contract year december  oil swaps  barrels day barrel each oil and gas swap contract uses the nymex wti west texas intermediate oil price and the nymex henry hub natural gas price as the referenced price 
based upon an average nymex strip price over the remaining contract term of barrel  the market value of our oil swaps liability at december   was million 
a increase in the future price of oil would have resulted in the market value of the combined oil derivative liability increasing by million 
the market value associated with the oil swap contract is reflected as a current liability as of december   in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
