overview ameresco is a leading provider of energy efficiency solutions for facilities throughout north america 
we provide solutions that enable customers to reduce their energy consumption  lower their operating and maintenance costs and realize environmental benefits 
our comprehensive set of services includes upgrades to a facility s energy infrastructure and the construction and operation of small scale renewable energy plants 
we report results under asc  segment reporting  for four segments us federal  central us region  other us regions and canada 
each segment provides customers with energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions 
these segments do not include results of other activities  such as operations and maintenance  or o m  and sales of renewable energy and certain other renewable energy products  that are managed centrally at our corporate headquarters  or corporate operating expenses not specifically allocated to the segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this annual report on form k 
the audited balance sheet  income statement and statement of cash flow included in our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report reflect certain reclassifications from our previously reported unaudited december  balance sheet  income statement and cash flow information 
the net effects of these reclassifications are to increase total assets  total liabilities and total stockholders equity by million  million and million from the respective amounts previously reported  to decrease general  administrative and other expenses and increase both operating income and other income expenses  net by million from the respective amounts previously reported  and to increase net cash provided by financing activities by million from the amount previously reported 
our revenue has increased from million in  our first full year of operations  to million in we achieved profitability in  and we have been profitable every year since 
in addition to organic growth  strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses and assets have been an important part of our development 
since inception  we have completed fifteen acquisitions  which have enabled us to broaden our service offerings and expand our geographical reach 
our acquisition of the energy services business of duke energy in expanded our geographical reach into canada and the southeastern united states and enabled us to penetrate the federal government market for energy efficiency projects 
the acquisition of the energy services business of exelon in expanded our geographical reach into the midwest 
our acquisition of the energy services business of northeast utilities in substantially grew our capability to provide services for the federal market and in europe 
our acquisition of southwestern photovoltaic in significantly expanded our offering of solar energy products and services 
our acquisition of energy services company quantum engineering and development  inc  or quantum  in expanded our geographical reach into the northwest 
we made three acquisitions in our acquisition of energy efficiency and demand side management consulting services provider aeg expanded our service offering to utility customers 
our acquisition of aps energy services company  inc  which we renamed ameresco southwest  a company that provides a full range of integrated energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions  strengthened our geographical position in the southwest 
in late we acquired the xchangepoint and energy projects businesses from eps to expand our service offering to private sector commercial and industrial customers 
these businesses offer energy efficiency solutions to customers across north america encompassing the food and beverage  meat  dairy  paper  aerospace  oil and gas and reit industries 
energy savings performance and energy supply contracts for our energy efficiency projects  we typically enter into energy savings performance contracts  or espcs  under which we agree to develop  design  engineer and construct a project and also commit that the project will satisfy agreed upon performance standards that vary from project to project 
these performance commitments are typically based on the design  capacity  efficiency or operation of the specific equipment and systems we install 
our commitments generally fall into three 
table of contents categories pre agreed  equipment level and whole building level 
under a pre agreed energy reduction commitment  our customer reviews the project design in advance and agrees that  upon or shortly after completion of installation of the specified equipment comprising the project  the commitment will have been met 
under an equipment level commitment  we commit to a level of energy use reduction based on the difference in use measured first with the existing equipment and then with the replacement equipment 
a whole building level commitment requires demonstration of energy usage reduction for a whole building  often based on readings of the utility meter where usage is measured 
depending on the project  the measurement and demonstration may be required only once  upon installation  based on an analysis of one or more sample installations  or may be required to be repeated at agreed upon intervals generally over up to years 
under our contracts  we typically do not take responsibility for a wide variety of factors outside our control and exclude or adjust for such factors in commitment calculations 
these factors include variations in energy prices and utility rates  weather  facility occupancy schedules  the amount of energy using equipment in a facility  and the failure of the customer to operate or maintain the project properly 
typically  our performance commitments apply to the aggregate overall performance of a project rather than to individual energy efficiency measures 
therefore  to the extent an individual measure underperforms  it may be offset by other measures that over perform 
in the event that an energy efficiency project does not perform according to the agreed upon specifications  our agreements typically allow us to satisfy our obligation by adjusting or modifying the installed equipment  installing additional measures to provide substitute energy savings  or paying the customer for lost energy savings based on the assumed conditions specified in the agreement 
many of our equipment supply  local design  and installation subcontracts contain provisions that enable us to seek recourse against our vendors or subcontractors if there is a deficiency in our energy reduction commitment 
from our inception to december   our total payments to customers and incurred equipment replacement and maintenance costs under our energy reduction commitments  after customer acceptance of a project  have been less than  in the aggregate 
see we may have liability to our customers under our espcs if our projects fail to deliver the energy use reductions to which we are committed under the contract in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
payments by the federal government for energy efficiency measures are based on the services provided and the products installed  but are limited to the savings derived from such measures  calculated in accordance with federal regulatory guidelines and the specific contract s terms 
the savings are typically determined by comparing energy use and other costs before and after the installation of the energy efficiency measures  adjusted for changes that affect energy use and other costs but are not caused by the energy efficiency measures 
for projects involving the construction of a small scale renewable energy plant that we own and operate  we enter into long term contracts to supply the electricity  processed landfill gas  or lfg  heat or cooling generated by the plant to the customer  which is typically a utility  municipality  industrial facility or other large purchaser of energy 
the rights to use the site for the plant and purchase of renewable fuel for the plant are also obtained by us under long term agreements with terms at least as long as the associated output supply agreement 
our supply agreements typically provide for fixed prices or prices that escalate at a fixed rate or vary based on a market benchmark 
see we may assume responsibility under customer contracts for factors outside our control  including  in connection with some customer projects  the risk that fuel prices will increase in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
project financing to finance projects with federal governmental agencies  we typically sell to the lenders our right to receive a portion of the long term payments from the customer arising out of the project for a purchase price reflecting a discount to the aggregate amount due from the customer 
the purchase price is generally advanced to us over the implementation period based on completed work or a schedule predetermined to coincide with the construction of the project 
under the terms of these financing arrangements  we are required to complete the construction or installation of the project in accordance with the contract with our customer  and the debt remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the completed project is accepted by the customer 
once the completed project is accepted by the customer  the financing is treated as a true sale and the related receivable and financing liability are removed from our consolidated balance sheet 
institutional customers  such as state  provincial and local governments  schools and public housing authorities  typically finance their energy efficiency and renewable energy projects through either tax exempt leases or issuances of municipal bonds 
we assist in the structuring of such third party financing 
in some instances  customers prefer that we retain ownership of the renewable energy plants and related project assets that we construct for them 
in these projects  we typically enter into a long term supply agreement to furnish electricity  gas  heat or 
table of contents cooling to the customer s facility 
to finance the significant upfront capital costs required to develop and construct the plant  we rely either on our internal cash flow or  in some cases  third party debt 
for project financing by third party lenders  we typically establish a separate subsidiary  usually a limited liability company  to own the project assets and related contracts 
the subsidiary contracts with us for construction and operation of the project and enters into a financing agreement directly with the lenders 
additionally  we will provide assurance to the lender that the project will achieve commercial operation 
although the financing is secured by the assets of the subsidiary and a pledge of our equity interests in the subsidiary  and is non recourse to ameresco  inc  we may from time to time determine to provide financial support to the subsidiary in order to maintain rights to the project or otherwise avoid the adverse consequences of a default 
the amount of such financing is included on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition to project related debt  we currently maintain a million senior secured credit facility with a group of commercial banks to finance our working capital needs 
see senior secured credit facility revolver and term loan below 
effects of seasonality we are subject to seasonal fluctuations and construction cycles  particularly in climates that experience colder weather during the winter months  such as the northern united states and canada  or at educational institutions  where large projects are typically carried out during summer months when their facilities are unoccupied 
in addition  government customers  many of which have fiscal years that do not coincide with ours  typically follow annual procurement cycles and appropriate funds on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
further  government contracting cycles can be affected by the timing of  and delays in  the legislative process related to government programs and incentives that help drive demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects 
as a result  our revenue and operating income in the third quarter are typically higher  and our revenue and operating income in the first quarter are typically lower  than in other quarters of the year 
as a result of such fluctuations  we may occasionally experience declines in revenue or earnings as compared to the immediately preceding quarter  and comparisons of our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
our annual and quarterly financial results are also subject to significant fluctuations as a result of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
see our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may fall below expectations in any particular fiscal quarter in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
backlog and awarded projects total construction backlog represents projects that are active within our espc sales cycle 
our sales cycle begins with the initial contact with the customer and ends  when successful  with a signed contract  also referred to as fully contracted backlog 
historically  our sales cycle typically has averaged to months 
awarded backlog is created when a potential customer awards a project to ameresco following a request for proposal 
once a project is awarded but not yet contracted  we typically conduct a detailed energy audit to determine the scope of the project as well as identify the savings that may be expected to be generated from upgrading the customer s energy infrastructure 
at this point  we also determine the sub contractor  what equipment will be used  and assist in arranging for third party financing  as applicable 
historically  awarded projects typically have taken to months to result in a signed contract and thus convert to fully contracted backlog 
it may take longer  however  depending upon the size and complexity of the project 
after the customer and ameresco agree to the terms of the contract and the contract becomes executed  the project moves to fully contracted backlog 
the contracts reflected in our fully contracted backlog typically have a construction period of to months  this is the period over which we expect to recognize revenue for customer contracts 
fully contracted backlog begins converting into revenue generated from backlog on a percentage of completion basis once construction has commenced 
see we may not recognize all revenue from our backlog or receive all payments anticipated under awarded projects and customer contracts in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k 
as of december   we had backlog of approximately million in future revenue under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects  which we sometimes refer to as fully contracted backlog  and we also had been awarded projects for which we do not yet have signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenue of an additional million 
as of december   we had fully contracted backlog of approximately million in future revenue under signed customer contracts for the installation or construction of projects  and we also had been awarded projects for which we had not yet signed customer contracts with estimated total future revenue of an additional million 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue we derive revenue from energy efficiency and renewable energy products and services 
our energy efficiency products and services include the design  engineering and installation of equipment and other measures to improve the efficiency and control the operation of a facility s energy infrastructure 
our renewable energy products and services include the construction of small scale plants that produce electricity  gas  heat or cooling from renewable sources of energy  the sale of such electricity  processed lfg  heat or cooling from plants that we own  and the sale and installation of solar energy products and systems 
while in any particular quarter a single customer may account for more than ten percent of revenue  for the years ended december  and  no customer accounted for more than ten percent of our revenue 
during the year ended december   one customer  the us department of energy  savannah river site  accounted for of our total revenue 
direct expenses and gross margin direct expenses include the cost of labor  materials  equipment  subcontracting and outside engineering that are required for the development and installation of our projects  as well as preconstruction costs  sales incentives  associated travel  inventory obsolescence charges and  if applicable  costs of procuring financing 
a majority of our contracts have fixed price terms  however  in some cases we negotiate protections  such as a cost plus structure  to mitigate the risk of rising prices for materials  services and equipment 
direct expenses also include o m costs for the small scale renewable energy plants that we own  including the cost of fuel if any and depreciation charges 
as a result of our acquisitions in  we now have intangible assets related to customer contracts  these are amortized over a period of approximately one to five years from the respective date of acquisition 
this amortization is a direct expense 
gross margin  which is gross profit as a percent of revenue  is affected by a number of factors  including the type of services performed and the geographic region in which the sale is made 
renewable energy projects that we own and operate typically have higher margins than energy efficiency projects  and sales in the united states typically have higher margins than in canada due to the typical mix of products and services that we sell there 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of salaries and benefits  project development costs  and general  administrative and other expenses 
salaries and benefits 
salaries and benefits consist primarily of expenses for personnel not directly engaged in specific project or revenue generating activity 
these expenses include the time of executive management  legal  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology and other staff not utilized in a particular project 
we employ a comprehensive time card system which creates a contemporaneous record of the actual time by employees on project activity 
we expect salaries and benefits to continue to increase as we continue to incur additional costs related to operating as a publicly traded company  including accounting  compliance and legal  as well as related to executing our growth plans 
project development costs 
project development costs consist primarily of sales  engineering  legal  finance and third party expenses directly related to the development of a specific customer opportunity 
this also includes associated travel and marketing expenses 
we intend to hire additional sales personnel and initiate additional marketing programs as we expand into new regions or complement existing development resources 
accordingly  we expect that our project development costs will continue to increase  but will moderate as a percentage of revenue over time 
general  administrative and other expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of rents and occupancy  professional services  insurance  unallocated travel expenses  telecommunications  office expenses and amortization of intangible assets not related to customer contracts 
professional services consist principally of recruiting costs  external legal  audit  tax and other consulting services 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue to incur additional costs related to operating as a publicly traded company  including increased audit and legal fees  costs of compliance with securities  corporate governance and other regulations  investor relations expenses and higher insurance premiums  particularly those related to director and officer insurance  as well as related to executing our growth plans 

table of contents other income expenses  net other income expenses  net consists primarily of interest income on cash balances  interest expense on borrowings and amortization of deferred financing costs  unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for as hedges  and realized gains on derivatives not accounted for as hedges 
interest expense will vary periodically depending on the amounts drawn on our revolving senior secured credit facility and the prevailing short term interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on various rates set by federal and local authorities and is affected by permanent and temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense and related disclosures 
the most significant estimates with regard to these consolidated financial statements relate to estimates of final contract profit in accordance with long term contracts  project development costs  project assets  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  fair value of derivative financial instruments  income taxes and stock based compensation expense 
such estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are made on an ongoing basis  and accordingly  the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition for each arrangement we have with a customer  we typically provide a combination of one or more of the following services or products installation or construction of energy efficiency measures  facility upgrades and or a renewable energy plant to be owned by the customer  sale and delivery  under long term agreements  of electricity  gas  heat  chilled water or other output of a renewable energy or central plant that we own and operate  sale and delivery of photovoltaic  or pv  equipment and other renewable energy products for which we are a distributor  whether under our own brand name or for others  and o m services provided under long term o m agreements  as well as consulting services 
often  we will sell a combination of these services and products in a bundled arrangement 
we divide bundled arrangements into separate deliverables and revenue is allocated to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the relative selling price is determined using vendor specific objective evidence  third party evidence or management s best estimate of selling price 
we recognize revenue from the installation or construction of a project on a percentage of completion basis 
the percentage of completion for each project is determined on an actual cost to estimated final cost basis 
in accordance with industry practice  we include in current assets and liabilities the amounts of receivables related to construction projects that are payable over a period in excess of one year 
we recognize revenue associated with contract change orders only when the authorization for the change order has been properly executed and the work has been performed and accepted by the customer 
when the estimate on a contract indicates a loss  or claims against costs incurred reduce the likelihood of recoverability of such costs  our policy is to record the entire expected loss immediately  regardless of the percentage of completion 
deferred revenue represents circumstances where i there has been a receipt of cash from the customer for work or services that have yet to be performed  ii receipt of cash where the product or service may not have been accepted by the customer or iii when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  but an estimate of the final total cost cannot be determined 
deferred revenue will vary depending on the timing and amount of cash receipts from customers and can vary 
table of contents significantly depending on specific contractual terms 
as a result  deferred revenue is likely to fluctuate from period to period 
unbilled revenue  presented as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  represent amounts earned and billable that were not invoiced at the end of the fiscal period 
we recognize revenue from the sale and delivery of products  including the output of our renewable energy plants  when produced and delivered to the customer  in accordance with the specific contract terms  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from o m contracts and consulting services as the related services are performed 
for a limited number of contracts under which we receive additional revenue based on a share of energy savings  we recognize such additional revenue as energy savings are generated 
project development costs we capitalize as project development costs only those costs incurred in connection with the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy projects  primarily direct labor  interest costs  outside contractor services  consulting fees  legal fees and associated travel  if incurred after a point in time when the realization of related revenue becomes probable 
project development costs incurred prior to the probable realization of revenue are expensed as incurred 
project assets we capitalize interest costs relating to construction financing during the period of construction 
the interest capitalized is included in the total cost of the project at completion 
the amount of interest capitalized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
routine maintenance costs are expensed in the current year s consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income to the extent that they do not extend the life of the asset 
major maintenance  upgrades and overhauls are required for certain components of our assets 
in these instances  the costs associated with these upgrades are capitalized and are depreciated over the shorter of the life of the asset or until the next required major maintenance or overhaul period 
gains or losses on disposal of property and equipment are reflected in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
we evaluate recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows before interest associated with the expected uses and eventual disposition of those assets 
when these comparisons indicate that the carrying value of those assets is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we apply asc topic in accounting for the valuation of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
during our annual goodwill impairment tests at december   and  we determined that the fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity  and therefore that goodwill and intangible assets were not impaired 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if such an assessment were to indicate that  more likely than not  the fair value of such assets was less than their carrying values 
judgment is required in determining whether an event has occurred that may impair the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
factors that could indicate that an impairment may exist include significant underperformance relative to plan or long term projections  significant changes in business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the base stock price of our public competitors for a sustained period of time 
the first step  or step  of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the equity with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the equity exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we performed a step test at our december   and annual testing dates and determined that the fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity  and therefore that goodwill was not impaired 

table of contents we completed the step test using both an income approach and a market approach 
the discounted cash flow method was used to measure the fair value of our equity under the income approach 
a terminal value utilizing a constant growth rate of cash flows was used to calculate a terminal value after the explicit projection period 
determining the fair value using a discounted cash flow method requires that we make significant estimates and assumptions  including long term projections of cash flows  market conditions and appropriate discount rates 
our judgments are based upon historical experience  current market trends  pipeline for future sales and other information 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions underlying the valuation methodology are reasonable  different estimates and assumptions could result in a different outcome 
in estimating future cash flows  we rely on internally generated projections for a defined time period for sales and operating profits  including capital expenditures  changes in net working capital and adjustments for non cash items to arrive at the free cash flow available to invested capital 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings of comparable publicly traded companies and comparable transactions of similar companies 
the estimates and assumptions used in our calculations include revenue growth rates  expense growth rates  expected capital expenditures to determine projected cash flows  expected tax rates and an estimated discount rate to determine present value of expected cash flows 
these estimates are based on historical experiences  our projections of future operating activity and our weighted average cost of capital 
in addition  we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets  taking into consideration any events or circumstances that might result in either a diminished fair value or revised useful life 
if the step test concludes an impairment is indicated  we will employ a second step to measure the impairment 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we will record a write down of the carrying value and charge the impairment as an operating expense in the period the determination is made 
although we believe goodwill and intangible assets are appropriately stated in our consolidated financial statements  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require an adjustment to the recorded balance 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets for events and circumstances that indicate a potential impairment 
a review of long lived assets for impairment is performed whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset as compared to the recorded value of the asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may be required against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
derivative financial instruments we account for our interest rate swaps as derivative financial instruments in accordance with the related guidance 
under this guidance  derivatives are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of our interest rate swaps is determined based on observable market data in combination with expected cash flows for each instrument 
in the normal course of business  we utilize derivative contracts as part of our risk management strategy to manage exposure to market fluctuations in interest rates 
these instruments are subject to various credit and market risks 
controls and monitoring procedures for these instruments have been established and are routinely reevaluated 
credit risk represents the potential loss that may occur because a party to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the measure of credit exposure is the replacement cost of contracts with a positive fair value 
we seek to manage credit risk by entering into financial instrument transactions only through counterparties that we believe to be creditworthy 
market risk represents the potential loss due to the decrease in the value of a financial instrument caused primarily by changes in interest rates 
we seek to manage market risk by establishing and monitoring limits on the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to interest rate risk through our borrowing activities 
a portion of our project financing includes three projects that utilize a variable rate swap instrument 
prior to december   we entered into two year interest rate swap contracts under which we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to  in turn  receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
during the year ended december   we entered into a year interest rate swap contract under which we agreed to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount  and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
we entered into the interest rate swap contracts as an economic hedge 
in july  we entered into a five year interest rate swap contract under which we agreed to pay an 
table of contents amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional amount  and to in turn receive an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the swap covers a notional amount of million variable rate note at a fixed interest rate of and expires in june we recognize all derivatives in our consolidated financial statements at fair value 
the interest rate swaps that we entered into prior to december  qualified  but were not designated as cash flow hedges until april  accordingly  any changes in fair value through march  were reported in other income expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income at fair value  and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income thereafter 
cash flows from these derivative instruments are reported as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the interest rate swaps that we entered into during and qualify  and have been designated  as cash flow hedges 
we recognize the fair value of derivative instruments designated as hedges in our consolidated balance sheets and any changes in the fair value are recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss 
with respect to our interest rate swaps  we recorded the unrealized gain loss in earnings in and of million and million  respectively  as other income expense in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
no unrealized gain loss was recorded in earnings for the year ended december  income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the liability method 
we provide for deferred income taxes based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities calculated using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be reflected in the tax return 
we account for uncertain tax positions using a more likely than not threshold for recognizing and resolving uncertain tax positions 
the evaluation of uncertain tax positions is based on factors that include  but are not limited to  changes in tax law  the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns  the effective settlement of matters subject to audit  new audit activity and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis and adjust the level of the liability to reflect any subsequent changes in the relevant facts surrounding the uncertain positions 
our liabilities for an uncertain tax position can be relieved only if the contingency becomes legally extinguished through either payment to the taxing authority or the expiration of the statute of limitations  the recognition of the benefits associated with the position meet the more likely than not threshold or the liability becomes effectively settled through the examination process 
we consider matters to be effectively settled once the taxing authority has completed all of its required or expected examination procedures  including all appeals and administrative reviews  we have no plans to appeal or litigate any aspect of the tax position  and we believe that it is highly unlikely that the taxing authority would examine or re examine the related tax position 
we also accrue for potential interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
business segments we report four segments us federal  central us region  other us regions and canada 
each segment provides customers with energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions 
the other us regions segment is an aggregation of four regions northeast us  southeast us  southwest us and northwest us these regions have similar economic characteristics in particular  expected and actual gross profit margins 
in addition  they sell products and services of a similar nature  serve similar types of customers and use similar methods to distribute their products and services 
accordingly  these four regions meet the aggregation criteria set forth in asc the all other category includes activities  such as o m and sales of renewable energy and certain other renewable energy products  that are managed centrally at our corporate headquarters 
it also includes all corporate operating expenses salaries and benefits  project development costs  and general  administrative and other not specifically allocated to the segments 
we do not allocate any indirect expenses to the segments 
stock based compensation expense our stock based compensation expense results from the issuances of shares of restricted common stock and grants of stock options to employees  directors  outside consultants and others 
we recognize the costs associated with option grants using the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
generally  asc requires the value of all stock based payments to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their estimated fair value at date of grant amortized over the grants respective vesting periods 

table of contents grants of restricted shares on october   we issued  shares of restricted stock to george p 
sakellaris  our founder  principal shareholder  president and chief executive officer under the stock plan in consideration for his personal indemnity of surety arrangements required for certain projects 
the shares vested in full upon the date three years from the date of grant 
at the time the shares were issued  the fair value was determined to be per share 
the shares vested in october we recorded an expense of million in related to this award 
no expense was recorded in and related to this award 
this expense is included in salaries and benefits in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
issuance of warrants as part of a financing agreement  we issued warrants to acquire  and  shares of common stock in and  respectively 
the warrants initially had a per share exercise price of and  respectively  however  the per share exercise price was subsequently reduced to 
during  we repurchased  of these warrants at an average price of per share  for a total price of million 
we recorded this transaction in additional paid in capital and it is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets for and in june  we issued  shares of common stock upon the exercise of a warrant at an exercise price of per share  and no warrants to purchase shares of our common stock remain outstanding 
stock option grants we have granted stock options to certain employees and directors under our stock incentive plan  however  we will grant no further stock options or restricted stock awards under that plan 
we have also granted stock options to certain employees and directors under our stock incentive plan 
at december    shares were available for grant under that plan 
under the terms of our and stock incentive plans  all options expire if not exercised within ten years after the grant date 
historically  options generally provided for vesting over five years  with vesting at the end of the first year and five percent vesting every three months beginning one year after the grant date 
during  we began awarding options generally providing for vesting over five years  with vesting on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date 
if the employee ceases to be employed for any reason before vested options have been exercised  the employee generally has three months to exercise vested options or they are forfeited 
we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc requiring that all stock based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options  be recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income based on their fair values  using the prospective transition method 
effective with the adoption of asc  we elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by the stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the following table sets forth the significant assumptions used in the model during  and years ended december  future dividends risk free interest rate expected volatility expected life years years years we will continue to use our judgment in evaluating the expected term  volatility and forfeiture rate related to our own stock based compensation on a prospective basis  and incorporating these factors into the black scholes pricing model 
higher volatility and longer expected lives result in an increase to stock based compensation expense determined at the date of grant 
in addition  any changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period that the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate  an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
if a 
table of contents revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated rate  an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
these expenses will affect our direct expenses  project development and marketing expenses  and salaries and benefits expense 
as of december   we had million of total unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to employee and director stock options 
we expect to recognize this cost over a weighted average period of years after december  the allocation of this expense between direct expenses  project development and marketing expenses  and salaries and benefits expense will depend on the salaries and work assignments of the personnel holding these options 
determination of fair value we believe we have used reasonable methodologies and assumptions in determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes 
prior to our initial public offering in july  our board of directors had historically estimated the fair value of our common stock 
because there was then no public market for our shares  our board of directors historically determined the fair value of our common stock based primarily on the market approach  together with a number of objective and subjective factors  including our results of operations and financial condition during the most recently completed period  forecasts of our financial results and market conditions affecting our business  and developments in our business 
the market approach estimates the fair value of a company by applying market multiples of publicly traded  or recently acquired  firms in the same or similar lines of business to the results and projected results of the company being valued 
in establishing exercise prices for our options  we followed a methodology designed to result in exercise prices that were not lower than  but could be higher than  the then fair value of our common stock 
when choosing companies for use in the market approach  we focused on companies that provide energy efficiency services and have high rates of growth 
to determine our enterprise value  we reviewed the multiple of market valuations of the comparable companies to their adjusted ebitda for the prior fiscal year based on publicly available data  as well as the multiples of adjusted ebitda for the prior fiscal year paid by us for our acquisitions 
based on this review  we established a market multiple which was generally higher than that of our comparable companies  and which we then applied to our own adjusted ebitda for the prior fiscal year 
to determine equity value  we added cash on hand at the end of the period and the cash from the pro forma exercise of stock options  and then subtracted senior corporate debt 
the resulting value was divided by the number of common shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis to obtain the fair value per share of common stock 
typically  we performed a new valuation annually after completing our audited consolidated financial statements 
we used adjusted ebitda in determining our enterprise value under the market approach because we believe that metric provides greater comparability than other metrics for the companies included in the analysis 
we considered using net income  book value and cash flow  however  we found those metrics less meaningful than adjusted ebitda due to varying levels of non cash and non operating income and expenses  and the effects of leverage  in the other companies financial statements 
we believe adjusted ebitda was the most meaningful financial metric for purposes of estimating the fair value of our common stock for financial statement reporting purposes because it is an unlevered measure of operating earnings potential before financing and certain other accounting decisions are considered 
in addition to the use of the market approach to determine the enterprise value  we considered the discounted cash flow methodology to estimate the equity value in the goodwill impairment analysis discussed in note the resulting equity values obtained from the discounted cash flow methodology corroborated the results of the market approach used in our contemporaneous common stock valuations 

table of contents since the beginning of  we have granted stock options with exercise prices as follows number of shares of common stock subject to option exercise price grant date or period grants per share january  july  to january  april  to january  july  to september  april  to may  the analysis undertaken in determining the exercise prices for all option grants between january  and july   the date of our initial public offering 
are summarized below 
grants on january  on october   our board of directors established the exercise price per share of common stock at per share 
the market approach resulted in an enterprise value of million  determined by applying the market multiple to our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  that value was increased by cash on hand totaling million and reduced by debt of million  for an equity value of million 
the equity value was divided by million fully diluted shares outstanding to arrive at the estimated fair value per share 
grants from july  to january  on july   our board of directors established the exercise price per share of common stock at per share 
the market approach resulted in an enterprise value of million  determined by applying the market multiple to our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  that value was increased by cash on hand totaling million and reduced by debt of million  for an equity value of million 
the equity value was divided by million fully diluted shares outstanding to arrive at the estimated fair value per share 
grants from april  to january  on april   our board of directors established the exercise price per share of common stock at per share 
the market approach resulted in an enterprise value of million  determined by applying the market multiple to our adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  that value was increased by cash on hand totaling million and reduced by debt of million 
in view of the increase in the number of options outstanding  we added the pro forma exercise cash value of the options  at a weighted average exercise price of per share  totaling million 
this resulted in an equity value of million  which was divided by million fully diluted shares outstanding to arrive at the estimated fair value per share 
grants from july  to september  on july   our board of directors established the exercise price per share of common stock at per share 
based on the methodology described above  our board would have decreased the value of a share of our common stock from to 
however  the decrease was due primarily to higher corporate debt levels and a lower cash balance  which in our board s view were the result primarily of the unprecedented economic conditions prevailing at that time 
our board  therefore  determined not to reduce its estimate of the fair value of the common stock and to maintain the value at per share 
in march  in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and in preparing for our initial public offering  our board of directors decided to undertake a reassessment of the fair value of our common stock in  and as a part of that reassessment  our board of directors took into account not only the factors it originally considered in determining fair value  but it also considered as of such dates the liquidation preferences of our preferred stock  including any financing and repurchase activities that may have occurred in the relevant period  the illiquid nature of our common stock  including the opportunity and timing for any expected liquidity events  our size and historical operating and financial performance  including our recent operating and financial projections as of each grant date  our existing backlog  
table of contents important events in the development of our business  and the market performance of a peer group comprised of selected publicly traded companies we identified as being guidelines for us 
in performing this retrospective analysis  we reexamined and reapplied the market approach and also applied the current value method to allocate the equity to the various share classes as outlined in the american institute of certified public accountants technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  which we refer to as the practice aid 
we believe that the valuation methodologies used in the retrospective analysis are reasonable and consistent with the practice aid 
in applying the current value method  we considered the rights of our series a convertible preferred stock  which we refer to as our series a preferred stock  and which will be converted into shares of class b common stock upon the closing of this offering 
the calculated enterprise value as of each of the valuation dates was significantly higher than the cumulative liquidation preference of our series a preferred stock of million 
we also determined that in each valuation date  the series a preferred stock would receive a substantially higher per share value on an as if converted to common stock basis than by retaining its liquidation preference 
thus for the purposes of these valuations the total equity value was divided by the fully diluted shares outstanding in order to calculate the per share value of our common stock 
in connection with this retrospective analysis  in determining our enterprise value  our analysis also considered the calculated multiple of market valuations of the comparable companies to their next months adjusted ebitda  and applied this multiple to our own next months projected adjusted ebitda  in addition to considering the enterprise value to trailing months adjusted ebitda  with more weight placed on our projected ebitda analysis than the historical adjusted ebitda analysis 
to determine equity value  we added cash on hand at the end of the period and the cash from the assumed pro forma exercise of in the money stock options  and then subtracted senior corporate debt 
to allocate the equity  we considered the option pricing method from the practice aid 
in connection with applying the option pricing method to value our common stock for these valuation dates  we determined that allocating the equity based on applying the option pricing method instead of the current value method in the contemporaneous valuations resulted in immaterial differences from the per share value calculated using the current value method 
following this retrospective analysis  our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock remained as previously determined in  and on january   and that the fair value was per share on july  and per share on september   as described below 
january  fair value calculation 
the fair value of our common stock as of january  was retrospectively determined to be per share 
in applying the market approach  our next months projected adjusted ebitda was primarily affected by the following factors continued challenges during in the us economy and decreased valuations of comparable companies  and concerns about liquidity during the upcoming fiscal quarters 
july  fair value calculation 
the fair value of our common stock as of july  was retrospectively determined to be per share 
the primary reason for the significant increase in the valuation of our common stock between january  and july  was the increase in our next months projected adjusted ebitda between those two dates 
our projected adjusted ebitda in july had increased significantly for the following reasons we were notified in march that the us department of energy had lifted restrictions on its ability to enter into espcs  which permitted us to proceed with the execution of larger federal contracts  in may  we executed a contract for our large us department of energy savannah river site renewable energy project  however  we had not yet secured the financing necessary to complete this project  and improvement in general economic and market conditions in the first half of the valuation of our common stock in july was also significantly affected by an increase  between january and july  in the multiple of market valuations of comparable companies that we applied to our next months projected adjusted ebitda 
the multiple we applied in this analysis in january  derived from publicly available data on the comparable companies we used in the market approach  was eight 
we increased the multiple we applied to ten in july  due primarily to the improvement in the public equity markets during this period 
in addition  this determination took into 
table of contents account our expectation that we would undertake an initial public offering within one year 
september  fair value calculation 
the fair value of our common stock as of september  was retrospectively determined to be per share 
the primary reason for the increase in the valuation of our common stock between july  and september  was the increase in our next months projected adjusted ebitda between those two dates 
our next months projected adjusted ebitda in september had increased from our next months projected adjusted ebitda in july  for the following reasons our backlog under signed customer contracts increased from july to september  in august  we secured the financing necessary to complete our large us department of energy savannah river site renewable energy project  the contract for which had been executed in may but was subject to our securing that financing 
securing this financing represented a significant milestone for us  particularly in light of its size and the significant disruptions in the credit and capital markets in the preceding several years  and improvement in general economic and market conditions in the third quarter of the valuation of our common stock in september was also affected by an increase  between july and september  in the multiple of market valuations of comparable companies that we applied to our next months projected adjusted ebitda 
the multiple we applied in this analysis in july  derived from publicly available data on the comparable companies we used in the market approach  was we increased the multiple we applied to in september  due primarily to the improvement in the public equity markets during this period 
our determination of fair market value in september also took into account our expectation that we would undertake an initial public offering within nine months 
we have incorporated the fair values calculated in the retrospective valuations into the black scholes option pricing model when calculating the stock based compensation expense to be recognized for the stock options granted during the period from july through september the retrospective valuations generated per share fair values of common stock of and  respectively  at july  and september  this resulted in intrinsic values of and per share  respectively  at each grant date 
april  fair value calculation 
the fair value of our common stock as of april  and may  was determined contemporaneously to be per share 
in determining this value  we employed the same methods and approaches used in the retrospective analysis described above 
the primary reasons for the increase in the valuation of our common stock from september  to april  and may  were a increase in our next months projected adjusted ebitda between september  and the two relevant dates in  due to growth in our backlog and several  previously contracted  large efficiency and renewable energy projects entering major construction phases  our expectation that we would conduct an initial public offering within the next three months  and our preliminary estimates of our valuation for purposes of this offering 
valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions 
there are significant judgments and estimates inherent in the determination of these valuations 
these judgments and estimates include assumptions regarding our future performance  the time to undertaking and completing an initial public offering or other liquidity event  as well as determinations of the appropriate valuation methods 
if we had made different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense  net income and net income per share could have been significantly different 
additionally  because our capital stock prior to this offering had characteristics significantly different from that which will apply upon the closing of this offering  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable  single measure of fair value 
the foregoing valuation methodologies are not the only valuation methodologies available and will not be used to value our class a or class b common stock once this offering is complete 
we cannot make assurances regarding any particular valuation of our shares

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on various rates set by federal  state  provincial and local authorities and is affected by permanent and temporary differences between financial accounting and tax reporting requirements 
our statutory rate  which is a combined federal and state rate  has ranged between and 
during  we recognized income taxes of million  or of pretax income 
the tax rate for included a net tax benefit of million relating to accrued interest on a tax position that was resolved during the third quarter of in addition to this net tax benefit  a one time item  the principal difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate was due to deductions permitted under section d of the 
table of contents code  which relate to the installation of certain energy efficiency equipment in federal  state  provincial and local government owned buildings  as well as production tax credits to which we are entitled from the electricity generated by certain plants that we own 
these energy efficiency tax benefits accounted for a million reduction in the provision  or a reduction of percentage points in the effective rate 
we expect the effective tax rate for to be higher than for during  we recognized income taxes of million  or of pretax income 
the principal difference between the statutory rate and the effective rate was due to deductions permitted under section d of the code  which relate to the installation of certain energy efficiency equipment in federal  state  provincial and local government owned buildings  as well as production tax credits to which we are entitled from the electricity generated by certain plants that we own

earnings per share in was per basic share  representing a decrease of  or  and per diluted share  representing an increase of  or 
the weighted average number of basic and diluted shares increased in by and  respectively 
the increase in our basic shares was due mainly to the conversion of million shares of series a preferred stock into million shares of class a common stock and million shares of class b common stock in connection with our initial public offering and the exercise of million options and warrants for shares of class a common stock 
the issuance and sale of million shares of class a common stock in our initial public offering contributed to the increase in both 
the increase in the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding also was the result of the grant of new stock options and the increase in the market price of our stock

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since inception  we have funded operations primarily through existing net cash available  cash flow from operations and various forms of debt 
we consider the difference between cash and cash equivalents and the book overdraft to represent the net cash available to meet our liquidity requirements 
those amounts were as follows for the years ended december   and fiscal years ended december  in s cash and cash equivalents book overdraft net cash available at december   we recorded a book overdraft which represents certain checks issued on a disbursement bank account but not yet paid by that bank 
accounting conventions require that the book overdraft be presented as a current liability 

table of contents there were no book overdrafts as of december  or we presented the book overdraft as a financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows

project financing construction and term loans 
we have entered into a number of construction and term loan agreements for the purpose of constructing and owning certain renewable energy plants 
the physical assets and the operating agreements related to the renewable energy plants are owned by wholly owned  single member special purpose subsidiaries 
these construction and term loans are structured as project financings made directly to a subsidiary  and upon acceptance of a project  the related construction loan converts into a term loan 
while we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to reflect these loans as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  they are generally nonrecourse and not direct obligations of ameresco  inc as of december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount under these loans  bearing interest at rates ranging from to and maturing at various dates from to one loan totaling million  does require ameresco  inc to provide assurance to the lender of the project performance 
as of december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount under these loans  bearing interest at rates ranging from to and maturing at various dates from to as of december   we had outstanding million in aggregate principal amount under these loans  bearing interest at rates ranging from to and maturing at various dates from to as of december   a term loan in the amount of million was in default as a result of the bankruptcy of the customer for the energy output of the plant financed by the loan 
the bankruptcy filing by the customer had constituted an event of default under the credit agreement  however  the customer emerged from bankruptcy in and continued operations 
to cure the default we decided to pay the loan in full during the third quarter of federal espc receivable financing 
we have arrangements with certain lenders to provide advances to us during the construction or installation of projects for certain customers  typically federal governmental entities  in exchange for our assignment to the lenders of our rights to the long term receivables arising from the espcs related to such projects 
these financings totaled million and million in principal amounts at december  and  respectively 
under the terms of these financing arrangements  we are required to complete the construction or installation of the project in accordance with the contract with our customer  and the debt remains on our consolidated balance sheet until the completed project is accepted by the customer 
our revolving senior secured credit facility and construction and term loan agreements require us to comply with a variety of financial and operational covenants 
as of december  we were in compliance with all of our financial and operational covenants 
in addition  we do not consider it likely that we will fail to comply with these covenants during the term of these agreements

federal espc receivable financing arrangements relate to the installation and construction of projects for certain customers  typically federal governmental entities  where we assign to the lenders our right to customer receivables 
we are relieved of the financing liability when the project is completed and accepted by the customer 
we typically expect to be relieved of the financing liability between one and three years from the date of project construction commencement

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  such as relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating financing transactions that are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  asu 
this update changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
this update is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited  and requires prospective application 
we are evaluating the effect  if any  that the adoption of asu will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in either case  a company is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
the amendment originally required the company to present on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented  however  this provision was deferred under amended accounting guidance issued by the fasb in december for public companies  
table of contents the amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and shall be applied retrospectively 
the company adopted this amendment on january  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which allows an entity to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
asu is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  and earlier adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates because we finance certain operations through fixed and variable rate debt instruments and denominate our transactions in us and canadian dollars 
changes in these rates may have an impact on future cash flows and earnings 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december  and million as of december  our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest expense paid on our senior secured credit facility 
derivative instruments we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  through our subsidiaries we do enter into derivative instruments for purposes other than trading purposes 
certain of the term loans that we use to finance our renewable energy projects bear variable interest rates that are indexed to short term market rates 
we have entered into interest rate swaps in connection with these term loans in order to seek to hedge our exposure to adverse changes in the applicable short term market rate 
in some instances  the conditions of our renewable energy project term loans require us to enter into interest rate swap agreements in order to mitigate our exposure to adverse movements in market interest rates 
the interest rate swaps that we have entered into qualify  and have been designated  as fair value hedges 
by using derivative instruments  we are subject to credit and market risk 
the fair market value of the derivative instruments is determined by using valuation models whose inputs are derived using market observable inputs  including interest rate yield curves  and reflects the asset or liability position as of the end of each reporting period 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes us  thus creating a receivable risk for us 
we are exposed to counterparty credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our derivative agreements 
we minimize counterparty credit or repayment risk by entering into transactions with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating 
our exposure to market interest rate risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings or cash flow 
foreign currency risk as a result of our operations in canada  we have significant expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in a foreign currency 
also  a significant number of employees are located in canada and we transact a significant amount of business in canadian currency 
consequently  we have determined that canadian currency is the functional currency for our canadian operations 
when we consolidate the operations of our canadian subsidiary into our financial results  because we report our results in us dollars  we are required to translate the financial results and position of our canadian subsidiary from canadian currency into us dollars 
we translate the revenues  expenses  gains  and losses from our canadian subsidiary into us dollars using a weighted average exchange rate for the applicable fiscal period 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the applicable balance sheet date 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period but are disclosed and accumulated in a separate component of consolidated equity until sale or until a complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in our canadian subsidiary takes place 
changes in the values of these items from one period to the next which result from exchange rate fluctuations are recorded in our consolidated statements of changes in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive 
table of contents income loss 
for the year ended december   due to changes in the us canadian exchange rate that were favorable to the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar  our foreign currency translation resulted in a gain of million which we recorded as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
for the years ended december   due to changes in the us canadian exchange rate that were unfavorable to the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar  our foreign currency translation resulted in a loss of million  respectively  which we recorded as a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a consequence  gross profit  operating results  profitability and cash flows are impacted by relative changes in the value of the canadian dollar 
we have not repatriated earnings from our canadian subsidiary  but have elected to invest in new business opportunities there 
we do not hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk
