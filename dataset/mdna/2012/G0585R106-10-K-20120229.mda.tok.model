item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction agl provides  through its operating subsidiaries  credit protection products to the united states us and international public finance  infrastructure and structured finance markets 
the company has applied its credit underwriting judgment  risk management skills and capital markets experience to offer insurance that protect holders of debt instruments and other monetary obligations from defaults in scheduled payments  including scheduled interest and principal payments 
financial guaranty contracts provide an unconditional and irrevocable guaranty that protects the holder of a financial obligation against non payment of principal and interest when due 
public finance obligations insured or assumed through reinsurance by the company consist primarily of general obligation bonds supported by the issuers taxing powers  tax supported bonds and revenue bonds and other obligations of states  their political subdivisions and other municipal issuers supported by the issuers or obligors covenant to impose and collect fees and charges for public services or specific projects 
public finance obligations include obligations backed by the cash flow from leases or other revenues from projects serving substantial public purposes  including government office buildings  toll roads  health care facilities and utilities 
structured finance obligations insured or assumed through reinsurance by the company are backed by pools of assets such as residential mortgage loans  consumer or trade receivables  securities or other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or market value and generally issued by special purpose entities 
the company currently does not underwrite us rmbs 
debt obligations guaranteed by the company s insurance subsidiaries are generally awarded ratings that are the same rating as the financial strength rating of the assured guaranty subsidiary that has guaranteed that obligation 
investors in products insured by agm or agc frequently rely on rating agency ratings 
therefore  low financial strength ratings or uncertainty over agm s or agc s abilities to maintain their financial strength ratings would have a negative impact on the demand for their insurance product 
a downgrade by moody s or s p of the financial strength ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries may have a negative impact on the company s liquidity 
a downgrade may trigger increased claims on some of the company s insurance policies  in certain cases  on a more accelerated basis than when the original transaction closed  or termination payments or collateral posting under cds contracts 
a downgrade in the financial strength ratings may also enable beneficiaries of the company s policies to cancel the credit protection offered by the company and cease paying premium 
a downgrade may also enable primary insurance companies that had ceded business to the company to recapture a significant portion of its in force financial guaranty reinsurance business

table of contents economic environment the company continued to be the most active provider of financial guaranty insurance in as a result of its financial strength and its ability to maintain its financial strength ratings in the double a ratings category throughout the financial crisis 
all of the company s pre financial guaranty competitors  except agm  which the company acquired in  have had their financial strength ratings downgraded by rating agencies to below investment grade levels or are no longer rated  rendering them unable to underwrite new business 
however  business conditions have been difficult for the entire financial guaranty insurance industry since mid and the company has faced challenges in maintaining its market penetration that continue today 
while the overall economic environment in the us at the end of was stronger than in  housing prices have not stabilized  unemployment rates have declined but remain relatively high and the ultimate credit experience on us rmbs transactions underwritten from the end of through by many financial institutions  including the financial guaranty insurers  remains poor 
furthermore  while hiring trends have improved  unemployment levels remain high and may take years to return to pre recession levels  which may adversely affect assured guaranty s loss experience on rmbs 
in addition  the economic recession has also affected the credit performance of other markets  including securitizations of trust preferred securities trups that include subordinated capital and notes issued by banks  mortgage real estate investment trusts and insurance companies 
the us municipal bond market  which has been the company s principal market since  has also changed significantly during the past three years 
municipal credits have experienced increased budgetary stress 
in addition  many states and towns have significant unfunded pension and retiree health care liabilities that create additional budgetary stress 
although total state tax collections as well as sales tax and personal income tax collections grew in  overall tax collections are still weak compared with recent historical standards 
in  new issuance volume in the us and international public finance sectors did not return to historical levels  and the market for financial guaranty insurance was hampered by ratings uncertainty and municipal rating recalibrations 
the primary contributing factors to the trend of low issuance volume have been municipal issuers took advantage of the expiring build america bonds program in as opposed to using financial guaranty insurance  a reduction in capital spending due to municipal budget constraints and fiscal austerity  resulting in less need for increased debt  and a reluctance to increase taxes to service principal and interest costs under new debt 
in the international arena  troubled eurozone countries are a source of stress in global equity and debt markets as the eu determines how to support financially weaker members such as greece 
the company s exposure to greece and other troubled eurozone countries is described in results of operations consolidated results of operations losses in the insured portfolio and insured portfolio selected european exposures 
the current economic environment has had a significant negative impact on the demand by investors for financial guaranty policies  and it is uncertain when or if demand for financial guaranties will return to their pre economic crisis level 
in particular  there has been limited demand for financial guaranties in in both the global structured finance and international infrastructure finance markets and also limited new issuance activity in those asset classes the company is actively trying to insure 
as a result  near term opportunities for financial guaranties in these two sectors are largely in secondary markets 
the company expects that global structured finance and international infrastructure opportunities will increase in the future as the global economy recovers  issuers return to the capital markets for financings and institutional investors again utilize financial guaranties  although the company cannot assure that this will occur 
financial guaranties had been an essential component of capital market financings for international infrastructure projects and asset based lending  such as for auto loans and leases and equipment financings  but these financings have been largely financed in recent years with relatively short term bank loans 
in  the company continued to be affected by a negative perception of financial guaranty insurers arising from the financial distress suffered by other companies in the industry during the financial crisis 
in addition  the financial strength ratings of the company s insurance subsidiaries were uncertain for most of the year 
in january  after affirming agm and agc s financial strength 
table of contents ratings at aa stable outlook in october  s p requested comments on proposed changes to its bond insurance ratings criteria  noting that if the proposed criteria were adopted  s p could lower its financial strength ratings on existing investment grade bond insurers by one or more rating categories 
in august  s p released its final criteria  which contained a new largest obligor test that had not been included in the january request for comment 
the largest obligor test had the effect of significantly reducing assured guaranty s allowed single risk limits and limiting its financial strength rating level 
then  in september  s p placed the financial strength ratings of agm and agc on creditwatch negative 
it was not until november that agm and agc were assigned financial strength ratings of aa stable outlook 
in addition  agm and agc s financial strength ratings have been rated aa negative outlook by moody s since december the negative perception of financial guaranty insurers arising from the financial distress suffered by other companies in the industry during the financial crisis and the rating uncertainty of the company s insurance subsidiaries caused by s p resulted in lower demand for the company s insurance product during the demand for the company s insurance has also been negatively impacted by its credit spread 
the spread is a reflection of the risk that investors perceive with the company 
the higher the spread  the greater the return investors will require for a security as to which the company has issued a policy  and the higher the interest coupon the issuer of the security will be required to pay 
if investors view the company as being only marginally less risky  or perhaps even as risky  as the uninsured security  the coupon on a security insured by the company may not be much lower  or may be the same as  an uninsured security offered by the same issuer 
accordingly  issuers may be unwilling to pay a premium for the company to insure their securities if the insurance does not lower the costs of issuance 
financial performance of assured guaranty financial results year ended december  change dollars in millions  except per share amounts selected income statement data net earned premiums net investment income realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives net unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives net change in fair value of financial guaranty variable interest entities loss and lae other operating expenses net income 
diluted earnings per share selected non gaap measures operating income operating income per share present value of new business production pvp please refer to non gaap financial measures 
business overview the company reported net income of million in  an increase of over  primarily as a result of lower fair value losses on consolidated financial guaranty variable interest entities fg vies  and the widening of agc credit spreads  which have the effect of increasing unrealized gains on credit derivatives 
credit spreads of underlying cds obligations and consolidated fg vies  and the company s own credit spreads  have had a significant effect on reported net income 
non gaap operating income was million in compared with million in 
table of contents the decrease in net earned premiums was consistent with the expected amortization of deferred premium revenue and was offset in part by an increase in refundings and accelerations 
net investment income increased due to a shift from cash and short term assets to the fixed income portfolio and additional earnings on higher invested asset balances 
realized gains and other settlements on credit derivatives decreased due to expected decreases in revenues received as the book of business amortizes and also due to an increase in claim payments on credit derivatives 
loss and lae in benefited significantly from increased estimates of recoveries for breaches of r w which largely offset increases in projected losses on the us rmbs portfolio 
reported loss and lae includes the recognition of losses due to amortization of the deferred premium revenue component of the stand ready obligation 
net economic loss development measures changes in the ultimate expected losses of the company and was million in driven primarily by increases in projected losses on greek exposures and other structure finance obligations 
in  the company focused on three principal strategies loss mitigation  including the pursuit of recoveries for r w breaches and of servicing improvements  strengthening its capital position to address s p s new bond insurance rating criteria  and new business development 
loss mitigation net expected loss to be paid for both financial guaranty insurance and credit derivatives increased million in the company continued its risk remediation strategies which lowered losses and also created additional rating agency capital 
the following are examples of the strategies employed by the company 
the bank of america agreement see results of operations consolidated results of operations losses in insured portfolio us rmbs loss mitigation and progress made on negotiations with other significant u 
s rmbs r w providers reduced expected losses by  million in for transactions with other sponsors of us rmbs  against which the company is pursuing r w claims  the company has continued to review additional loan files and has found breach rates consistent with those in the bank of america transactions and has therefore increased the benefit for r w to reflect the probability that actual recovery rates may be higher than originally expected 
excluding the benefit for r w  expected loss to be paid on us rmbs increased by  million  which reflects a slower recovery in the housing market than previously anticipated 
the company is continuing to purchase attractively priced big obligations it had already insured in order to mitigate losses  which resulted in a reduction to net expected loss to be paid of million as of december  as of december   the carrying value of assets purchased for loss mitigation purposes was million  with a par of  million 
the company has established a group to mitigate rmbs losses by influencing mortgage servicing  including  if possible  causing the transfer of servicing or establishing special servicing 
as a result of the company s efforts  at december  the servicing of approximately million of mortgage loans had been transferred to a new servicer and another billion of mortgage loans were being special serviced 
special servicing is an industry term referencing more intense servicing applied to delinquent loans aimed at mitigating losses 
the company also agreed to terminate its exposure to certain structured finance risks  and it reassumed risks that it had ceded to certain lower rated reinsurers 
improve capital position since s p s january announcement that it planned to change its bond insurer rating criteria  the company has been pursuing strategies to improve its rating agency capital position 
in addition to its focus on loss mitigation and new business development  the company increased capital under rating agency capital models by agreeing to terminate cds with net par of billion  resulting in million in accelerated revenues 
in addition  several cmbs cds contracts  which carried high rating agency capital charges  were terminated for a payment of million in in addition  in january  agc and agm entered into an aggregate excess of loss reinsurance facility that covers certain us public finance credits insured or reinsured by agc or agm as of 
table of contents september  at agc s and agm s option  the facility will cover losses occurring from january  through december  or from january  through december  the contract terminates  unless agc and agm choose to extend it  on january  the facility attaches when agc s or agm s net losses exceed in the aggregate billion and covers a portion of the next million of losses  with the reinsurers assuming pro rata in the aggregate million of the million of losses and agc and agm jointly retaining the remaining million of losses 
the reinsurers are required to be rated at least aa stable outlook through december  or to post collateral sufficient to provide agm and agc with the same reinsurance credit as reinsurers rated aa 
this facility provides additional rating agency capital credit 
new business development management believes that the company is able to provide value not only by insuring the timely payment of scheduled interest and principal amounts when due  but also through its underwriting skills and surveillance capabilities  particularly with regard to the us public finance market 
few individual or even institutional investors have the analytic resources to cover the tens of thousands of municipal credits in the market 
through its financial guaranty  the company undertakes the tasks of credit selection  analysis  negotiation of terms  surveillance and  if necessary  remediation 
management believes this allows retail investors to participate more widely  institutional investors to operate more efficiently  and smaller  less well known issuers to gain market access on a more cost effective basis 
reduced issuances in the us public finance market and ratings uncertainty caused by s p s bond insurer rating criteria hampered new business development throughout most of the company s us public finance market penetration in was  based on the number of new issue transactions  and  based on the amount of new issue par sold 
in its principal target market  issuances of single a underlying credit quality  the company guaranteed of the transactions sold and of the related par 
among issues with par amounts of million or less  the company guaranteed of the aggregate par sold across all rating categories 
in addition  the company sought other means to increase value through commutations of previously ceded books of business 
in  the company cancelled an assumed reinsurance contract for a gain of million and cancelled ceded reinsurance contracts for a gain of million 
as a continuation of its strategy to create value through new business and commutation  on january   the company announced a three part agreement with radian under which it reassumed billion of par it had previously ceded to radian  reinsured approximately billion of radian public finance par and agreed to acquire miac  which is licensed to provide financial guaranty insurance and reinsurance in us jurisdictions including the district of columbia 
the purchase of miac is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of

in the fourth quarter  assured guaranty took advantage of emerging opportunities in the global infrastructure and structured finance markets 
in the international infrastructure sector  the company closed its first significant transaction in over two years  when it replaced another guarantor on a uk private finance initiative bond issue that had been used to finance the construction and operation of the worcestershire royal hospital 
structured finance pvp also increased in  primarily due to a fourth quarter transaction in which the company provided regulatory capital relief for a life insurance company 
results of operations estimates and assumptions the company s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are determined using estimates and assumptions 
the actual amounts realized could ultimately be materially different from the amounts currently provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most significant items requiring inherently subjective and complex estimates are expected losses  including assumptions for breaches of r w  fair value estimates  other than temporary impairment otti  deferred income taxes  and premium revenue recognition 

table of contents an understanding of the company s accounting policies for these items is of critical importance to understanding its consolidated financial statements 
see item financial statements and supplementary data of this form k for a discussion of significant accounting policies and fair value methodologies 
the following discussion of the results of operations includes information regarding the estimates and assumptions used for these items and should be read in conjunction with the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
comparability of periods presented consolidation of fg vie the adoption of a new consolidation model for vies on january  affects comparability for and when compared to on january   fg vies were consolidated at fair value 
as of december  and  the company had consolidated and fg vies  respectively 
in and  the company consolidated vies when it had both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
the company continuously evaluates its power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of vies that have debt obligations insured by the company 
the company obtains protective rights under its insurance contracts that give the company additional controls over a vie if there is either deterioration of deal performance or in the financial health of the deal servicer 
under gaap  the company is deemed to be the control party typically when its protective rights give it the power to both terminate and replace the deal servicer 
adoption of revised otti standard the company adopted a gaap standard on april   which prescribed bifurcation of credit and non credit related otti in realized investment gains losses and other comprehensive income oci  respectively

the principal operating subsidiary acquired was agm formerly financial securities assurance inc 
the acquired companies are collectively referred to as the acquired companies 
the agmh subsidiaries that conducted agmh s former financial products business the financial products companies were sold to dexia holdings prior to the agmh acquisition 
the total purchase price of million was paid in a combination of million in cash and million agl common shares 
agl issued approximately million common shares to dexia  all of which dexia subsequently sold in a secondary offering that closed in march the july  agmh acquisition affects the comparability of periods presented because amounts include only the last six months of activity for agmh 
due to the significance of the agmh acquisition in terms of unearned premiums reserve  and invested assets  the main driver of variances between and was the consolidation of agmh 

table of contents due to the unprecedented credit crisis  the company acquired agmh at a significant discount to its book value primarily because the fair value of the obligation associated with its financial guaranty insurance contracts was significantly in excess of the obligation s historical carrying value 
the company recorded the fair value of these contracts based on what a hypothetical similarly rated financial guaranty insurer would have charged for each contract at the acquisition date and not the actual cash flows under the insurance contract 
this resulted in some agmh acquired contracts having a significantly higher unearned premium reserve and  consequently  higher premium earnings  compared to the contractual premium cash flows for the contracts 
on the acquisition date  there were limited financial guaranty contracts being written in the structured finance market  particularly in the us rmbs asset class 
therefore  for certain asset classes  significant judgment was required to determine the estimated fair value of the acquired contracts 
the company determined the fair value of these contracts by taking into account the rating of the insured obligation  expectation of loss  estimated risk premiums  sector and term

on september   the transaction documents required an analysis of the value of fsa asset management llc fsam assets versus the gics obligations and other associated liabilities of the financial products companies 
on that day  the required amount of assets exceeded the liabilities  and therefore dexia was not required to post additional collateral to support its protection arrangements 
assured guaranty believes the assets owned by the financial products companies are sufficient for them to meet their gic obligations and other associated liabilities 
however  dexia is required to post additional collateral if there is any shortfall in assets as compared with liabilities in the future 
in addition  as further described under liquidity and capital resources liquidity arrangements with respect to agmh s former financial products business  the company has entered into various agreements with dexia pursuant to which dexia has assumed the credit and liquidity risks associated with agmh s former financial products business 
the cash portion of the purchase price for the agmh acquisition was financed through the sale of  common shares and  equity units in a public offering in june the equity units initially consist of a forward purchase contract and a undivided beneficial ownership interest in  principal amount senior notes due issued by agus senior notes 
for a description of the equity units  see liquidity and capital resources commitments and contingencies long term debt obligations debt issued by agus senior notes 
the net proceeds after underwriting expenses and offering costs for these two offerings totaled approximately million 
the company has agreed with dexia holdings to operate the business of agm in accordance with certain key parameters that will limit the company s operating and financial flexibility 
such restrictions include  for a three year period following the acquisition date  the inability to insure new structured finance obligations  required rating agency confirmation that certain specified actions would not cause any downgrade of agm  inability to pay dividends  and inability to enter into certain commutation  novation or cutthrough reinsurance agreements over specified amounts 
generally  for three years after the closing of the agmh acquisition unless agm is rated below a by moody s and aa by s p  it will only insure public finance and infrastructure obligations 
an exception applies in connection with the recapture of business ceded by agm to a third party reinsurer under certain circumstances 
agm will continue to be domiciled in new york and be treated as a monoline bond insurer for regulatory purposes

agm will not repurchase  redeem or pay any dividends in relation to any class of equity interests  unless a at such time agm is rated at least aa by s p and aa by moody s if such rating agencies still rate financial guaranty insurers generally and the aggregate amount of such dividends in any year does not exceed of agmh s debt service for that year  or b agm receives prior rating agency confirmation that such action would not cause any rating currently assigned to agm to be downgraded immediately following such action 
agm will not enter into a commutation or novation agreements with respect to its insured public finance portfolio involving a payment by agm exceeding million  or b any cut through reinsurance  pledge of collateral security or similar arrangement involving a payment by agm whereby the benefits of reinsurance purchased by agm or of other assets of agm would be available on a preferred or priority basis to a particular class or subset of policyholders of agm relative to the position of dexia as policyholder upon the default or insolvency of agm whether or not with the consent of any relevant insurance regulatory authority 
this provision does not limit collateral arrangements between agm and its subsidiaries in support of intercompany reinsurance obligations  or statutory deposits or other collateral arrangements required by law in connection with the conduct of business in any jurisdiction  or pledges of recoveries or other amounts to secure repayment of amounts borrowed under agm s soft capital facilities or its strip liquidity facility with dcl

furthermore  until the date on which a credit rating has been assigned by s p and moody s to the gic issuers and or the liabilities of the gic issuers under the relevant gics have been separately rated by s p and moody s which is independent of the financial strength rating of agm  and the principal amount of gics in relation to which a downgrade of agm may result in a requirement to post collateral or terminate such gic  notwithstanding the existence of a separate rating referred to in of at least aa or higher is below billion the agm de linkage date agm will restrict its liquidity exposure such that no gic contracts or similar liabilities insured by agm after the closing shall have terms that require acceleration  termination or prepayment based on a downgrade or withdrawal of any rating assigned to agm s financial strength  a downgrade of the issuer or obligor under the agreement  or a downgrade of any third party  and agm will continue to be rated by each of moody s and s p  if such rating agencies still rate financial guaranty insurers generally 
notwithstanding the above  all such restrictions will terminate on any date after the agm de linkage date that the aggregate principal amount or notional amount of exposure of dexia holdings and any of its affiliates excluding the exposures relating to the financial products business to

as a result  the company has expected losses to be expensed in future periods  which represents past or future claim payments that have not yet been expensed 
expected loss to be paid is important from a liquidity perspective in that it provides the present value of amounts that the company expects 
table of contents to pay or recover in future periods 
expected loss to be expensed is important because it presents the company s projection of incurred losses that will be recognized in future periods as deferred premium revenue amortizes into income on financial guaranty insurance policies 
both of these measures are discussed below 
for contracts accounted for as credit derivatives  the company records the fair value of these contracts on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
in periods prior to  when the company was actively writing credit derivatives  they were considered an extension of the financial guaranty insurance business 
the company s credit derivatives are not actively traded as are credit derivatives in other financial services industries 
management expects the fair value gains and losses to reverse to zero as the contract approaches maturity  except for economic claim payments 
see net change in fair value of credit derivatives 
expected claim payments are considered in the fair value of each contract and is an important measure for management to analyze the net economic loss on credit derivatives 
the fair value recorded on the balance sheet represents a hypothetical exit price determined using significant level inputs in an internally developed model while the expected loss to be paid uses methodologies and assumptions consistent with financial guaranty insurance expected losses to be paid 
see note  fair value measurement  of the financial statements and supplementary data 
for consolidated fg vies expected loss to be paid is reflected in the fair value of the fg vies liabilities 
the company carries the assets and liabilities of the fg vies at fair value under the fair value option election 
management assesses credit impairment on consolidated fg vies in the same manner as other financial guaranty insurance or credit derivative contracts 
the fair value of fg vies recorded on the balance sheet reflects additional factors other than expected loss such as changes in market spreads and the company s own credit spreads 
these contracts are not actively traded and therefore management expects the fair value gains and losses to reverse to zero as the contract approaches maturity  except for economic claim payments made by agc and agm 
expected loss to be paid for fg vies pursuant to agc s and agm s financial guaranty policies is calculated in a manner consistent with financial guaranty insurance contracts 
in order to effectively evaluate and manage the economics of the entire insured portfolio  management compiles and analyzes loss information for all policies on a consistent basis 
that is  management monitors and assigns ratings and calculates expected losses in the same manner for all its exposures regardless of form or differing accounting models 
management also considers contract specific characteristics that affect the estimates of expected loss 
the discussion of expected losses in us rmbs loss projections  us rmbs loss mitigation and other non rmbs losses below encompasses expected losses on all policies in the insured portfolio  whatever the accounting treatment  while note  financial guaranty insurance contracts  of the financial statements and supplementary data  encompasses policies accounted for as financial guaranty insurance 
surveillance personnel are responsible for monitoring and reporting on all transactions in the insured portfolio 
the primary objective of the surveillance process is to monitor trends and changes in transaction credit quality  detect any deterioration in credit quality  and recommend to management such remedial actions as may be necessary or appropriate 
all transactions in the insured portfolio are assigned internal credit ratings  and surveillance personnel are responsible for recommending adjustments to those ratings to reflect changes in transaction credit quality 
surveillance personnel present analysis related to potential losses to the company s loss reserve committees for consideration in estimating the expected loss to be paid 
such analysis includes the consideration of various scenarios with potential probabilities assigned to them 
depending upon the nature of the risk  the company s view of the potential size of any loss and the information available to the company  that analysis may be based upon individually developed cash flow models  internal credit rating assessments and sector driven loss severity assumptions or judgmental assessments 
in the case of its assumed business  the company may conduct its own analysis as just described or  depending on the company s view of the potential size of any loss and the information available to the company  the company may use loss estimates provided by ceding insurers 
the company s loss reserve committees 
table of contents review and refresh the estimate of expected loss to be paid each quarter 
the company s estimate of ultimate loss on a policy is subject to significant uncertainty over the life of the insured transaction due to the potential for significant variability in credit performance as a result of economic  fiscal and financial market variability over the long duration of most contracts 
the determination of expected loss to be paid is an inherently subjective process involving numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments by management 
us rmbs loss projections the company projects losses on its insured us rmbs on a transaction by transaction basis by projecting the performance of the underlying pool of mortgages over time and then applying the structural features ie  payment priorities and tranching of the rmbs to the projected performance of the collateral over time 
the resulting projected claim payments or reimbursements are then discounted using risk free rates 
for transactions where the company projects it will receive recoveries from providers of r w  it projects the amount of recoveries and either establishes a recovery for claims already paid or reduces its projected claim payments accordingly 
the further behind a mortgage borrower falls in making payments  the more likely it is that he or she will default 
the rate at which borrowers from a particular delinquency category number of monthly payments behind eventually default is referred to as the liquidation rate 
liquidation rates may be derived from observed roll rates  which are the rates at which loans progress from one delinquency category to the next and eventually to default and liquidation 
the company applies liquidation rates to the mortgage loan collateral in each delinquency category and makes certain timing assumptions to project near term mortgage collateral defaults from loans that are currently delinquent 
mortgage borrowers that are not more than one payment behind generally considered performing borrowers have demonstrated an ability and willingness to pay throughout the recession and mortgage crisis  and as a result are viewed as less likely to default than delinquent borrowers 
performing borrowers that eventually default will also need to progress through delinquency categories before any defaults occur 
the company projects how many of the currently performing loans will default  and when  by first converting the projected near term defaults of delinquent borrowers derived from liquidation rates into a vector of conditional default rates  then projecting how the conditional default rates will develop over time 
loans that are defaulted pursuant to the conditional default rate after the liquidation of currently delinquent loans represent defaults of currently performing loans 
a conditional default rate is the outstanding principal amount of defaulted loans liquidated in the current month divided by the remaining outstanding amount of the whole pool of loans or collateral pool balance 
the collateral pool balance decreases over time as a result of scheduled principal payments  partial and whole principal repayments  and defaults 
in order to derive collateral pool losses from the collateral pool defaults it has projected  the company applies a loss severity 
the loss severity is the amount of loss the transaction experiences on a defaulted loan after the application of net proceeds from the disposal of the underlying property 
the company projects loss severities by sector based on its experience to date 
the shape of the rmbs loss projection curves used by the company in both the year end of and the year end of assume that the housing and mortgage markets will eventually recover 
the company retained the same general shape of the rmbs loss projection curves at year end as at year end  reflecting the company s view  based on its observation of continued elevated levels of early stage delinquencies  that the housing and mortgage market recovery is occurring at a slower than previously expected pace 
over the course of  the company also made a number of changes to its rmbs loss projection assumptions reflecting that same view of the housing and mortgage markets 
the scenarios the company used to project rmbs collateral losses for second lien rmbs transactions at year end were essentially the same as those it used at year end  except that based on its observation of the continued elevated levels of early stage delinquencies  i as noted above  the company retained the same general shape of its rmbs loss projection curves  ii the company increased its base case expected period for reaching the final conditional default rate in  and iii the company adjusted the probability weightings it applied from year end to reflect the changes to those scenarios 
taken together  the changes in assumptions between year end and 
table of contents had the effect of reflecting a slower recovery in the housing market than had been assumed at the beginning of the year 
the company used the same general approach to project rmbs collateral losses for first lien rmbs transactions at year end as it did at year end  except that i as noted above  based on its observation of the continued elevated levels of early stage delinquencies  the company retained the same general shape of its rmbs loss projection curves  ii based on its observation of increased loss severity rates  the company increased its projected loss severity rates in various of its scenarios  and iii based on its observation of liquidation rates  the company decreased the liquidation rates it applies to non performing loans the company made this change at year end 
finally  again reflecting continued high levels of early stage delinquencies and increased loss severity rates  the company added a more stressful scenario at year end reflecting an even slower potential recovery in the housing and mortgage markets 
adjusting the probability weightings to include such fifth scenario resulted in the scenario that the company considers to be its base scenario and which forms the basis of the description in the following pages to shift to the scenario that in previous quarters was assumed to be one of the stress scenarios 
taken together  the changes in assumptions between year end and had the effect of a reflecting a slower recovery in the housing market than had been assumed at the beginning of the year and b for subprime transactions increasing the initial loss severities in most scenarios from to and for other first lien transactions increasing initial loss severities from to and peak loss severities in a stress case from to 
the company also used generally the same methodology to project the credit received for recoveries in r w at year end as at year end the primary difference relates to the execution of the bank of america agreement and the inclusion of the terms of the agreement as a potential scenario in transactions not covered by the bank of america as well as incorporating the projected terms of a potential agreement with another entity 
compared with year end  the company calculated r w credits for two more second lien transactions and more first lien transactions where either it obtained loan files  concluded it had the right to obtain loan files that it had not previously concluded were accessible or anticipates receiving a benefit due to an agreement or potential agreement with an r w provider

us rmbs loss mitigation on april   assured guaranty reached a comprehensive agreement with bank of america corporation and its subsidiaries  including countrywide financial corporation and its subsidiaries collectively  bank of america  regarding their liabilities with respect to rmbs transactions insured by assured guaranty  including claims relating to reimbursement for breaches of r w and historical loan servicing issues bank of america agreement 
of the rmbs transactions  eight are second lien transactions and are first lien transactions 
the bank of america agreement covers bank of america sponsored securitizations that agm or agc has insured  as well as certain other securitizations containing concentrations of countrywide originated loans that agm or agc has insured 
the transactions covered by the bank of america agreement have a gross par outstanding of billion billion net par outstanding as of december   with of assured guaranty s total big rmbs net par outstanding covered by the bank of america agreement 
bank of america paid  million in in respect of covered second lien transactions and is obligated to pay another million by march in consideration of the billion  the company has agreed to release its claims for the repurchase of mortgage loans underlying the eight second lien transactions ie assured guaranty will retain the risk of future insured losses without further offset for r w claims against bank of america 
in addition  bank of america will reimburse assured guaranty of claims assured guaranty pays on the first lien transactions  until aggregate collateral losses on such rmbs transactions reach 
table of contents billion 
the company accounts for the loss sharing agreement with bank of america as subrogation 
as the company calculates expected losses for these first lien transactions  such expected losses will be offset by an r w benefit from bank of america for of these amounts 
as of december   bank of america had placed approximately million of eligible assets in trust in order to collateralize the reimbursement obligation relating to the first lien transactions 
the amount of assets required to be posted may increase or decrease from time to time  as determined by rating agency requirements 
as of december   the company s estimate of expected future recoveries for the first lien transactions covered under the bank of america agreement was million  discounted and gross of reinsurance 
as of december   cumulative collateral losses on the first lien rmbs transactions were approximately billion 
the company estimates that cumulative projected collateral losses for these first lien transactions will reach billion  which will result in estimated gross expected losses to the company of million before considering r w recoveries from bank of america  and million after considering such r w recoveries 
as of december   the company had been reimbursed million and had invoiced for an additional million in claims paid in december with respect to the covered first lien transactions under the bank of america agreement 
the benefit for r w in reflects higher expected recoveries across all transactions as a result of the bank of america agreement 
for transactions covered under the bank of america agreement  the r w benefit has been updated to reflect amounts collected and expected to be collected under the terms of the bank of america agreement 
for transactions with other sponsors of us rmbs  against which the company is pursuing r w claims  the company has increased the benefit for r w in to reflect the probability that actual recovery rates may be higher than originally expected 
for transactions involving r w providers other than bank of america  the company has continued to review additional loan files and has found breach rates consistent with those in the bank of america transactions 
the company believes the bank of america agreement was a significant step in the effort to recover us rmbs losses the company experienced resulting from breaches of r w 
the company is continuing to pursue other representation and warranty providers for us rmbs transactions it has insured 
see recovery litigation in note  financial guaranty insurance contracts  of the financial statements and supplementary data for a discussion of the litigation proceedings the company has initiated against other r w providers 
the company is in the process of enforcing claims for breaches of r w regarding the characteristics of the loans included in the collateral pools 
through december  the company has caused entities providing r ws to pay or agree to pay approximately billion in respect of their r w liabilities 
of this  billion are payments made or to be made directly to the company pursuant to agreements with r w providers eg the bank of america agreement and approximately million are amounts paid or committed to be paid into the relevant rmbs transactions pursuant to the transaction documents 
the billion of payments made or to be made directly to the company by r w providers includes billion that has already been received by the company as well as million the company projects receiving in the future pursuant to such currently existing agreements 
because most of that million is projected to be received through loss sharing arrangements  the exact amount the company will receive will depend on actual losses experienced by the covered transactions 
that million is included in the company s calculated credit for r w recoveries  described below 
the million paid  or committed to be paid  by r w providers into the relevant rmbs transactions pursuant to the transaction documents flow through the transaction waterfalls 
because the company may insure only a portion of the capital structure of a transaction  such payments will not necessarily directly benefit the company dollar for dollar  especially in first lien transactions 
however  such payments do reduce collateral pool losses and so usually reduce the company s expected losses 
based on this success in pursuing r w breaches to date  the company calculates a credit for future r w recoveries where the r w were provided by an entity the company believes to be financially viable and where the company already has access or believes it will attain access to the underlying mortgage loan files 
where the company has an agreement or potential agreement with an 
table of contents r w provider eg  the bank of america agreement  that credit is based on the agreement or potential agreement 
in second lien rmbs transactions where there is no agreement or advanced discussions  this credit is based on a percentage of actual repurchase rates achieved across those transactions where material repurchases have been made  while in first lien rmbs transactions  where there is no agreement or advanced discussions  this credit is estimated by reducing collateral losses projected by the company to reflect a percentage of the recoveries the company believes it will achieve  which factor is derived based on the number of breaches identified to date and incorporated scenarios based on the amounts the company was able to negotiate under the bank of america agreement 
the first lien approach is different from the second lien approach because the company s first lien transactions have multiple tranches and a more complicated method is required to correctly allocate credit to each tranche 
in each case  the credit is a function of the projected lifetime collateral losses in the collateral pool  so an increase in projected collateral losses increases the r w credit calculated by the company 
further detail regarding how the company calculates these credits may be found under breaches of representations and warranties in note  financial guaranty insurance contracts  of the financial statements and supplementary data 
the net expected losses to be paid includes an r w credit of  million net of reinsurance 
of this  million is the projected benefit of existing agreements with r w providers 
the company projects the overall future cash flow from a collateral pool by adjusting the payment stream from the principal and interest contractually due on the underlying mortgages for a the collateral losses it projects as described above  b assumed voluntary prepayments and c recoveries for breaches of r w as described above 
the company then applies an individual model of the structure of the transaction to the projected future cash flow from that transaction s collateral pool to project the company s future claims and claim reimbursements for that individual transaction 
finally  the projected future claims and reimbursements are discounted using a current risk free rate to arrive at expected loss to be paid 
as noted above  the company runs several sets of assumptions regarding mortgage collateral performance  or scenarios  and probability weights them 
other non rmbs losses for student loans  the company is projecting approximately million of net expected loss to be paid in these portfolios 
in general the losses are due to i the poor credit performance of private student loan collateral  ii high interest rates on auction rate securities with respect to which the auctions have failed or iii high interest rates on variable rate demand obligations that have been put to the liquidity provider by the holder and are therefore bearing high bank bond interest rates 
the largest of these losses was approximately million and related to a transaction backed by a pool of private student loans ceded to ag re by another monoline insurer 
the guaranteed bonds were issued as auction rate securities that now bear a high rate of interest due to the downgrade of the primary insurer s financial strength rating 
further  the underlying loan collateral has performed below expectations 
the decrease of approximately million in net expected loss during is due to favorable commutations achieved by the primary insurer on some transactions partially offset by deterioration in other transactions 
the company projects losses for trust preferred securities collateralized debt obligations trups cdos by projecting the performance of the asset pools across several scenarios which it weights and applying the cdo structures to the resulting cash flows 
as of december   the company has projected net expected losses to be paid for trups cdos of million 
the decrease of approximately million in net expected loss during was driven primarily by the effect of lower libor rates on the floating rate coupons of certain transactions which was partially offset by reduction in risk free rates used to discount loss projections 
the company has insured billion of net par in xxx life insurance reserve securitizations based on discrete blocks of individual life insurance business of which million is rated big 
based on its analysis of the information currently available  including estimates of future investment performance provided by the investment manager  and projected credit impairments on the invested assets and performance of the blocks of life insurance business at december   the company s projected net expected loss to be paid of million 
the increase of approximately million 
table of contents during is due primarily to deterioration in rmbs investments and a reduction of the risk free rate used to discount loss projections 
as of december   the company had exposure to sovereign debt of greece through financial guarantees of million of debt million on a net basis due in with a fixed coupon and million of debt million on a net basis due in with a inflation linked coupon 
the hellenic republic of greece  as obligor  has been paying interest on such notes on a timely basis 
on february   greece announced the terms of exchange offers and consent solicitations that request the voluntary participation by holders of certain greek bonds in an exchange that would result in the reduction of of the notional amount of such bonds  and request the consent of holders to amendments of the bonds that could be used to effectively impose the same terms on holders that do not voluntarily participate in the exchange 
on february   the greek parliament enacted legislation that introduces collective action clauses into eligible greek law governed bonds to permit the terms of such bonds to be amended with the consent of less than all the holders of those bonds 
the bonds insured under the financial guarantees were included in the list of greek bonds covered by the exchange offer and or consent solicitation 
the bonds due in were issued under greek law and thus are susceptible to a coercive exchange pursuant to the new legislation that might trigger a claim under the company s policy 
the bonds due in were issued under english law and already contain a collective action clause that could entail similar results 
greece has stated that its use of collective action clauses will depend on the level of participation in the exchange offer and or consent solicitation 
the company is currently evaluating the exchange offer and consent solicitation 
if greece does not utilize the collective action clauses  the company believes the proposal should not trigger claim payments under its financial guarantees 
the company has considered a variety of scenarios in its loss reserve estimation process including the nature of the proposed exchange and the value of the consideration it would receive if it were to participate in the exchange  either voluntarily or involuntarily 
the expected loss to be paid was million gross of reinsurance and million net of reinsurance as of december  the company also has expected losses for certain other transactions discussed in note  financial guaranty insurance contracts  of the financial statements and supplementary data  including jefferson county  a transaction backed by revenues from yellow pages  and transactions backed by manufactured housing loans 
net expected loss to be paid in the tables below consists primarily of the present value of future expected claim payments  expected recoveries of excess spread in the transaction structures  cessions to reinsurers  and expected recoveries for breaches of r w and other loss mitigation strategies 
assumptions used in the determination of the net expected loss to be paid presented below  such as delinquency  severity  and discount rates and expected timeframes to recovery in the mortgage market were consistent by sector regardless of the accounting model used

the amounts presented below do not represent amounts recorded as loss reserves in the consolidated financial statements because of the various accounting models required under gaap  but instead represent the economic changes in loss estimates for the insured portfolio as a whole  which is how management analyzes the information 
expected losses to be paid are first calculated without consideration of the expected r w benefit

economic loss development includes the effects of changes in assumptions based on observed market trends  changes in discount rates  accretion of discount and the economic effects of loss mitigation efforts 
total economic loss development in was million 
us rmbs development was a net development of million which reflects higher losses in the underlying collateral  largely offset by a higher r w benefit as a result of the bank of america agreement  and additional loan reviews that demonstrate similar breach rates for other counterparties 
the net r w development in was an increase of  million  which served to offset loss development in us rmbs of  million 
loss development  before the consideration of r w benefit was a function of several factors including increasing the assumed period of time for reaching the final conditional default rate  updated probability weightings of its various scenarios  and increased first lien severity 
in  the company probability weighted several possible outcomes and estimated a net expected loss to be paid of million million gross of reinsurance 
due to the decline in interest rates in and the gaap requirement to update discount rates at each reporting period to the current risk free rates  the economic loss development was negatively affected  although this change does not reflect additional credit deterioration 
the remainder of the economic loss development related primarily to increased loss adjustment expense estimates  and changes in other structured finance and public finance loss estimates that are mostly based on transaction specific facts and circumstances 
accounting treatment of losses for transactions accounted for as financial guaranty insurance for transactions accounted for as financial guaranty insurance under gaap  each transaction s expected loss to be expensed  net of estimated r w recoveries  is compared with the deferred premium revenue of that transaction 
generally  when the expected loss to be expensed exceeds the deferred premium revenue  a loss is recognized in the income statement for the amount of such excess 
when the company measures operating income  a non gaap financial measure  it calculates the credit derivative and fg vie losses incurred in a similar manner 
changes in fair value in excess of expected loss that are not indicative of economic deterioration are not included in operating income 
for financial guaranty contracts accounted for as insurance  the amounts reported in the gaap financial statements may only reflect a portion of the current period s economic development and may also include a portion of prior period economic development 
the difference between economic loss development and loss and lae recognized in income is essentially loss development and accretion for

net change in fair value of credit derivatives financial guaranty contracts accounted for as credit derivatives are generally structured such that the circumstances giving rise to the company s obligation to make loss payments are similar to those 
table of contents for financial guaranty insurance contracts and only occurs upon one or more defined credit events such as failure to pay or bankruptcy  in each case  as defined within the transaction documents  with respect to one or more third party referenced securities or loans 
financial guaranty contracts accounted for as credit derivatives are primarily comprised of cds 
in general  the company structures credit derivative transactions such that the circumstances giving rise to the company s obligation to make loss payments are similar to those for financial guaranty insurance contracts but are governed by isda documentation 
until the company ceased selling credit protection through credit derivative contracts in the beginning of  following the issuance of regulatory guidelines that limited the terms under which the credit protection could be sold  management considered these agreements to be a normal part of its financial guaranty business 
these contracts generally qualify as derivatives under us gaap  and are reported at fair value  with changes in fair value included in earnings 
fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
the fair value gain or loss is based on estimated market pricing and may not be an indication of ultimate claims 
changes in fair value of credit derivatives occur because of changes in interest rates  credit spreads  credit ratings of the referenced obligations  the company s credit spread  settlements and other market factors 
the unrealized gains losses on credit derivatives  excluding expected losses to be paid which are included in the previous section  is expected to reverse to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure or early termination that was not anticipated in the expected losses to be paid 
expected losses to be paid in respect of contracts accounted for as credit derivatives are included in the discussion above losses in the insured portfolio 
see also liquidity and capital resources liquidity requirements and sources 
in the event that the company is able to terminate and does terminate a credit derivative contract prior to maturity  the resulting gain or loss is realized through net change in fair value of credit derivatives 
changes in the fair value of the company s credit derivatives that do not reflect actual or expected claims or credit losses have no impact on the company s statutory claims paying resources  rating agency capital or regulatory capital positions 
the impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume  tenor  interest rates  and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined 
in addition  since each transaction has unique collateral and structural terms  the underlying change in fair value of each transaction may vary considerably 
the fair value of credit derivative contracts also reflects the change in the company s own credit cost based on the price to purchase credit protection on agc and agm 
the company determines its own credit risk based on quoted cds prices traded on the company at each balance sheet date 
generally  a widening of the cds prices traded on agc and agm has an effect of offsetting unrealized losses that result from widening general market credit spreads  while a narrowing of the cds prices traded on agc and agm has an effect of offsetting unrealized gains that result from narrowing general market credit spreads 
an overall narrowing of spreads generally results in an unrealized gain on credit derivatives for the company and an overall widening of spreads generally results in an unrealized loss for the company 
there are typically no quoted prices for its instruments or similar instruments as cds issued by financial guaranty insurance companies 
financial guaranty contracts do not typically trade in active markets 
observable inputs other than quoted market prices exist  however  these inputs reflect contracts that do not contain terms and conditions similar to those in the credit derivatives issued by the company 
therefore  the valuation of the company s credit derivative contracts requires the use of models that contain significant  unobservable inputs  and are classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
see note  fair value measurement  of the financial statements and supplementary data 
the fair value of these instruments represents the difference between the present value of remaining contractual premiums charged for the credit protection and the estimated present value of premiums that a comparable financial guarantor would hypothetically charge for the same protection at the balance sheet date 
the fair value of these contracts depends on a number of factors including notional amount of the contract  expected term  credit spreads  changes in interest rates  the credit ratings of the referenced entities  the company s own credit risk and remaining contractual flows 

table of contents contractual cash flows are the most readily observable inputs since they are based on the cds contractual terms 
these variables include net premiums received and receivable on written credit derivative contracts  net premiums paid and payable on purchased contracts  losses paid and payable to credit derivative contract counterparties and losses recovered and recoverable on purchased contracts 
these models are primarily developed internally based on market conventions for similar transactions that the company observed in the past 
there has been very limited new issuance activity in this market over the past three years and as of december   market prices for the company s credit derivative contracts were generally not available 
inputs include various market indices  credit spreads  the company s own credit spread  and estimated contractual payments to estimate the fair value of its credit derivatives 
management considers the non standard terms of its credit derivative contracts in determining the fair value of these contracts 
these terms differ from more standardized credit derivatives sold by companies outside of the financial guaranty industry 
the non standard terms include the absence of collateral support agreements or immediate settlement provisions 
in addition  the company employs relatively high attachment points 
because of these terms and conditions  the fair value of the company s credit derivatives may not reflect the same prices observed in an actively traded market of cds that do not contain terms and conditions similar to those observed in the financial guaranty market 
the company s models and the related assumptions are continuously reevaluated by management and enhanced  as appropriate  based upon improvements in modeling techniques and availability of more timely and relevant market information 
the company considers r w claim recoveries in determining the fair value of its cds contracts 
valuation models include the use of management estimates and current market information 
management is also required to make assumptions on how the fair value of credit derivative instruments is affected by current market conditions 
management considers factors such as current prices charged for similar agreements  performance of underlying assets  life of the instrument and the nature and extent of activity in the financial guaranty credit derivative marketplace 
the assumptions that management uses to determine its fair value may change in the future due to market conditions 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the assumptions used in the valuation models to determine the fair value  actual experience may differ from the estimates reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements and the differences may be material

effect of the company s credit spread change on fair value of credit derivatives gain loss year ended december  in millions change in fair value of credit derivatives before considering implication of the company s credit spreads resulting from change in the company s credit spreads after considering implication of the company s credit spreads management believes that the trading levels of agc s and agm s credit spreads are due to the correlation between agc s and agm s risk profile and the current risk profile of the broader financial markets and to increased demand for credit protection against agc and agm as the result of its financial guaranty volume  as well as the overall lack of liquidity in the cds market 
offsetting the inception to date benefit attributable to agc s and agm s credit spread were fair value losses in fixed income security market prices primarily attributable to widening spreads in certain markets as a result of the continued deterioration in credit markets and some credit rating downgrades 
the higher credit spreads in the fixed income security market are due to the lack of liquidity in the high yield cdo and clo markets as well as continuing market concerns over the most recent vintages of subprime rmbs 

table of contents in  us rmbs unrealized fair value gains were generated primarily in the option arm  alt a  prime first lien and subprime sectors due to tighter implied net spreads 
the tighter implied net spreads were primarily a result of the increased cost to buy protection in agc s name as the market cost of agc s credit protection increased 
these transactions were pricing above their floor levels or the minimum rate at which the company would consider assuming these risks based on historical experience  therefore when the cost of purchasing cds protection on agc  which management refers to as the cds spread on agc  increased  the implied spreads that the company would expect to receive on these transactions decreased 
the unrealized fair value gain in other primarily resulted from tighter implied net spreads on a xxx life securitization transaction and a film securitization  which also resulted from the increased cost to buy protection in agc s name  referenced above 
the cost of agm s credit protection also increased during the year  but did not lead to significant fair value gains  as the majority of agm policies continue to price at floor levels 
claim payments increased primarily due to payments on transactions that were either restructured or where we obtained collateral 
with respect to cds transactions for which there is an expected claim payment within the next twelve months  the allocation of gross spreads was revised in the first quarter to reflect a higher allocation to the cost of credit rather than the bank profit component 
in the current market  it is assumed that a bank would be willing to accept a lower profit on distressed transactions in order to remove these transactions from its financial statements 
the effect of this refinement in assumptions was an increase in fair value losses of million during the first quarter and was concentrated in the alt a first lien and option arm sectors 
in  us rmbs unrealized fair value losses were generated primarily in the alt a option arm and alt a first lien sector due to wider implied net spreads 
the wider implied net spreads were a result of internal ratings downgrades on several of these alt a option arm and alt a first lien policies 
the unrealized fair value gain within the trups cdo and other asset classes resulted from tighter implied spreads 
these transactions were pricing above their floor levels or the minimum rate at which the company would consider assuming these risks based on historical experience  therefore when the cost of purchasing cds protection on agc and agm increased  which management refers to as the cds spread on agc or agm  the implied spreads that the company would expect to receive on these transactions decreased 
during  agc s and agm s spreads widened 
however  gains due to the widening of the company s own cds spreads were offset by declines in fair value resulting from price changes and the internal downgrades of several us rmbs policies referenced above 
in  agc s and agm s credit spreads narrowed  but remained relatively wide compared to pre levels 
offsetting the benefit attributable to agc s and agm s wide credit spread were declines in fixed income security market prices primarily attributable to widening spreads in certain markets as a result of the continued deterioration in credit markets and some credit rating downgrades 
the higher credit spreads in the fixed income security market were primarily due to continuing market concerns over the most recent vintages of subprime rmbs and trust preferred securities

fair value gain loss on committed capital securities committed capital securities ccs consist of committed preferred trust securities which allow agc and agm to issue preferred stock to trusts created for the purpose of issuing such securities that invest in high quality investments and selling put options to agc and agm in exchange for cash 
the fair value of ccs represents the difference between the present value of remaining expected put option premium payments under agc s ccs the agc ccs securities and agm committed preferred trust securities the agm cps securities agreements and the value of such estimated payments based upon the quoted price for such premium payments as of the reporting dates see note  fair value measurement  of the financial statements and supplementary data 
changes in fair value of this financial instrument are included in the consolidated statement of operations 
the significant market inputs used were observable  therefore  the company classified this fair value measurement as level prior to the third quarter of the ccs were transferred to level on the fair value hierarchy in the third quarter of because the company was no longer able to obtain the same level of pricing information as in past quarters 
a driver of fair value gain loss on ccs is the cds spread of agc and agm 
generally  widening of these cds spreads from one period to the next results in gains while tightening results in losses

agmh had historically been the most significant ceding reinsurance company within the company s assumed book of business 
as a result of the agmh acquisition  which significantly diminished the company s potential near future market for assuming reinsurance  combined with the continued credit crisis  which has adversely affected the fair value of the company s in force policies  management determined that the full carrying value of million of goodwill on its books prior to the agmh acquisition should be written off in third quarter in addition  the company recognized a million bargain purchase gain on the agmh acquisition and also recorded a charge of million to settle pre existing relationships 
the bargain purchase gain represents the excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the purchase price 
as disclosed in note  business combinations  of the financial statements and supplementary data  the company and agmh had a pre existing reinsurance relationship in which the company assumed financial guaranty risks ceded to it by agmh

table of contents provision for income tax deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse

accordingly  the company s overall corporate effective tax rate fluctuates based on the distribution of taxable income across these jurisdictions 
during the year ended december   a net tax benefit of million was recorded by the company due to the filing of an amended tax return which included the agmh and subsidiaries tax group 
the amended return filed in september was for a period prior to the agmh acquisition and consequently  the company no longer has a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss or amt credits associated with the agmh acquisition 
instead  the company has recorded additional deferred tax assets for loss reserves and foreign tax credits and has decreased its liability for uncertain tax positions 
the event giving rise to this recognition occurred after the measurement period as defined by acquisition accounting and thus the amount is included in the year ended december  net income

financial guaranty variable interest entities on january   the company adopted a new accounting standard as required by the financial accounting standards board that changed how a company determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the new accounting standard requires the company to perform an analysis to determine whether its variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a fg vie 
the new accounting standard mandated the accounting changes prescribed by the statement to be recognized by the company as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  the cumulative effect of adopting the new accounting standard was a million after tax decrease to the opening retained earnings balance due to the consolidation of fg vies at fair value on january  this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a fg vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a fg vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the fg vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the fg vie 
under gaap  the company is deemed to be the control party typically when its protective rights give it the power to both terminate and replace the deal servicer 
additionally  this new accounting standard requires an ongoing reassessment of whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a fg vie 

table of contents pursuant to the new accounting standard  the company evaluated its power to direct the significant activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of vies that have debt obligations insured by the company and  accordingly  where the company is obligated to absorb vie losses that could potentially be significant to the vie 
as of december   the company determined that  based on the assessment of its control rights over servicer or collateral manager replacement  given that servicing managing collateral were deemed to be the vies most significant activities  vies required consolidation  compared to vies consolidated at december  the following table presents the effects on reported gaap income resulting from consolidating these fg vies and eliminating their related insurance and investment accounting entries and represents a difference between gaap reported net income and non gaap operating income 
see non gaap financial measures operating income below 
effect of consolidating fg vies on net income year ended december  in millions net earned premiums net investment income net realized investment gains losses net change in fair value of fg vies loss and lae total pretax effect on net income less tax provision benefit total effect on net income net change in fair value of fg vies represents the net change in fair value of the consolidated fg vies assets and liabilities that is reported under gaap 
these contracts are not actively traded and therefore management expects the fair value gains and losses to reverse to zero as the contract approaches maturity  except for economic claim payments made by agc and agm 
during  the company recorded a net fair value loss on fg vies of million  which was driven primarily by price deterioration on several heloc transactions 
during the period  long term conditional default rates increased on these transactions  which caused the prices for these helocs to decline 
the prices for the corresponding liability for these transactions remained relatively consistent with the prior year 
during  the fair value of fg vies liabilities decreased principally as a result of lengthening duration of the expected payback period of these liabilities due to improved performance of the underlying fg vies assets supporting the cash flows for the fg vies liabilities 
in  the company consolidated vies for which it determined that it was the primary beneficiary  based on accounting rules in effect at the time 
in determining whether the company was the primary beneficiary prior to  a number of factors were considered  including the design of the entity and the risks the vie was created to pass along to variable interest holders  the extent of credit risk absorbed by the company through its insurance contract and the extent to which credit protection provided by other variable interest holders reduces this exposure and the exposure that the company cedes to third party reinsurers 
the criteria for determining whether the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie has changed as of january   as described above 
expected losses to be recovered paid in respect of consolidated fg vies  which were million as of december  and million as of december   are included in the discussion of losses in the insured portfolio above 
non gaap financial measures to reflect the key financial measures management analyzes in evaluating the company s operations and progress towards long term goals  the company discusses both measures promulgated in accordance with gaap and measures not promulgated in accordance with gaap non gaap 
table of contents financial measures 
although the financial measures identified as non gaap should not be considered substitutes for gaap measures  management considers them key performance indicators and employs them as well as other factors in determining compensation 
non gaap financial measures  therefore  provide investors with important information about the key financial measures management utilizes in measuring its business 
the primary limitation of non gaap financial measures is the potential lack of comparability to those of other companies  which may define non gaap measures differently because there is limited literature with respect to such measures 
three of the primary non gaap financial measures analyzed by the company s senior management are operating income  adjusted book value and pvp 
assured guaranty s management and board of directors utilize non gaap financial measures in evaluating the company s financial performance and as a basis for determining senior management incentive compensation 
by providing these non gaap financial measures  investors  analysts and financial news reporters have access to the same information that management reviews internally 
in addition  assured guaranty s presentation of non gaap financial measures is consistent with how analysts calculate their estimates of assured guaranty s financial results in their research reports on assured guaranty and with how investors  analysts and the financial news media evaluate assured guaranty s financial results 
the following paragraphs define each non gaap financial measure and describe why it is useful 
a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure and the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  if available  is also presented below 
non gaap financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for their most directly comparable gaap measures

see provision for income tax in  a decrease in net earned premiums and premiums received and receivable on credit derivatives were partially offset by a decrease in loss and lae and other operating expenses and increased net investment income 
the increase in operating income in was primarily attributable to the inclusion of months of agmh compared to six months in  commutation gains and the recording of a tax benefit of million in due to the filing of an amended tax return for a period prior to the agmh acquisition  offset in part by higher loss and lae 
excluding the agmh acquisition  the decline in earned premiums in compared to relates primarily to lower refundings and accelerations 
net earned premiums and credit derivative revenue from the agm structured finance book of business will decline as the net par runs off

operating income in included additional expense 
table of contents items attributable to the agmh acquisition which were million in compared to million in  and goodwill and settlement of pre existing relationships 
management believes that operating income is a useful measure because it clarifies the understanding of the underwriting results of the company s financial guaranty insurance business  and also includes financing costs and net investment income  and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the company s financial results as compared with the consensus analyst estimates distributed publicly by financial databases 
operating income is defined as net income loss attributable to agl  as reported under gaap  adjusted for the following elimination of the after tax realized gains losses on the company s investments  except for gains and losses on securities classified as trading 
the timing of realized gains and losses  which depends largely on market credit cycles  can vary considerably across periods 
the timing of sales  is largely subject to the company s discretion and influenced by market opportunities  as well as the company s tax and capital profile 
trends in the underlying profitability of the company s business can be more clearly identified without the fluctuating effects of these transactions 
elimination of the after tax non credit impairment unrealized fair value gains losses on credit derivatives  which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses  and non economic payments 
such fair value adjustments are heavily affected by  and in part fluctuate with  changes in market interest rates  credit spreads and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss 
additionally  such adjustments present all financial guaranty contracts on a more consistent basis of accounting  whether or not they are subject to derivative accounting rules 
elimination of the after tax fair value gains losses on the company s ccs 
such amounts are heavily affected by  and in part fluctuate with  changes in market interest rates  credit spreads and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss 
elimination of the after tax foreign exchange gains losses on revaluation of net premium receivables 
long dated receivables constitute a significant portion of the net premium receivable balance and represent the present value of future contractual or expected collections 
therefore  the current period s foreign exchange revaluation gains losses are not necessarily indicative of the total foreign exchange gains losses that the company will ultimately recognize 
elimination of the effects of consolidating fg vies in order to present all financial guaranty contracts on a more consistent basis of accounting  whether or not gaap requires consolidation 
gaap requires the company to consolidate certain vies that have issued debt obligations insured by the company even though the company does not own such vies 
elimination of goodwill and settlement of pre existing relationship in order to show the contribution to operating income of agmh without the distorting effects of acquisition accounting adjustments recorded on the acquisition date 
adjusted book value and operating shareholders equity management also uses adjusted book value to measure the intrinsic value of the company  excluding franchise value 
growth in adjusted book value is one of the key financial measures used in determining the amount of certain long term compensation to management and employees and used by rating agencies and investors

adjusted book value decreased slightly  mainly due to economic loss development which was largely offset by r w recoveries  and new business 
shares outstanding decreased by million due primarily to the repurchase of million shares  which was partially offset by the issuance of vested restricted stock awards and units in  which resulted in higher adjusted book value per share despite a slight decline in adjusted book value 
management believes that operating shareholders equity is a useful measure because it presents the equity of agl with all financial guaranty contracts accounted for on a more consistent basis and excludes fair value adjustments that are not expected to result in economic loss 
many investors  analysts and financial news reporters use operating shareholders equity as the principal financial measure for valuing agl s current share price or projected share price and also as the basis of their decision to recommend to buy or sell agl s common shares 
many of the company s fixed income investors also use operating shareholders equity to evaluate the company s capital adequacy 
operating shareholders equity is the basis of the calculation of adjusted book value see below 
operating shareholders equity is defined as shareholders equity attributable to assured guaranty ltd  as reported under gaap  adjusted for the following elimination of the effects of consolidating fg vies in order to present all financial guaranty contracts on a more consistent basis of accounting  whether or not gaap requires consolidation 
gaap requires the company to consolidate certain vies that have issued debt obligations insured by the company even though the company does not own such vies 
elimination of the after tax non credit impairment unrealized fair value gains losses on credit derivatives  which is the amount in excess of the present value of the expected estimated economic credit losses  and non economic payments

elimination of the after tax fair value gains losses on the company s ccs 
such amounts are heavily affected by  and in part fluctuate with  changes in market interest rates  credit spreads and other market factors and are not expected to result in an economic gain or loss 

table of contents elimination of the after tax unrealized gains losses on the company s investments that are recorded as a component of aoci excluding foreign exchange revaluation 
the aoci component of the fair value adjustment on the investment portfolio is not deemed economic because the company generally holds these investments to maturity and therefore should not recognize an economic gain or loss 
management believes that adjusted book value is a useful measure because it enables an evaluation of the net present value of the company s in force premiums and revenues in addition to operating shareholders equity 
the premiums and revenues included in adjusted book value will be earned in future periods  but actual earnings may differ materially from the estimated amounts used in determining current adjusted book value due to changes in foreign exchange rates  prepayment speeds  terminations  credit defaults and other factors 
many investors  analysts and financial news reporters use adjusted book value to evaluate agl s share price and as the basis of their decision to recommend  buy or sell the agl common shares 
adjusted book value is operating shareholders equity  as defined above  further adjusted for the following elimination of after tax deferred acquisition costs 
these amounts represent net deferred expenses that have already been paid or accrued and will be expensed in future accounting periods 
addition of the after tax net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenue 
see below 
addition of the after tax value of the unearned premium reserve on financial guaranty contracts in excess of expected loss to be expensed  net of reinsurance 
this amount represents the expected future net earned premiums  net of expected losses to be expensed  which are not reflected in gaap equity 
net present value of estimated net future credit derivative revenue management believes that this amount is a useful measure because it enables an evaluation of the value of future estimated credit derivative revenue 
there is no corresponding gaap financial measure 
this amount represents the present value of estimated future revenue from the company s credit derivative in force book of business  net of reinsurance  ceding commissions and premium taxes for contracts without expected economic losses  and is discounted at which represents the company s tax equivalent pretax investment yield on its investment portfolio 
estimated net future credit derivative revenue may change from period to period due to changes in foreign exchange rates  prepayment speeds  terminations  credit defaults or other factors that affect par outstanding or the ultimate maturity of an obligation

table of contents management believes that pvp is a useful measure because it enables the evaluation of the value of new business production for the company by taking into account the value of estimated future installment premiums on all new contracts underwritten in a reporting period as well as premium supplements and additional installment premium on existing contracts as to which the issuer has the right to call the insured obligation but has not exercised such right  whether in insurance or credit derivative contract form  which gaap gross premiums written and the net credit derivative premiums received and receivable portion of net realized gains and other settlement on credit derivatives credit derivative revenues do not adequately measure 
pvp in respect of insurance and credit derivative contracts written in a specified period is defined as gross upfront and installment premiums received and the present value of gross estimated future installment premiums  in each case  discounted at the company s tax equivalent pretax investment yield on its investment portfolio 
for purposes of the pvp calculation  management discounts estimated future installment premiums on insurance contracts at  while under gaap  these amounts are discounted at a risk free rate 
additionally  under gaap  management records future installment premiums on financial guaranty insurance contracts covering non homogeneous pools of assets based on the contractual term of the transaction  whereas for pvp purposes  management records an estimate of the future installment premiums the company expects to receive  which may be based upon a shorter period of time than the contractual term of the transaction 
actual future net earned or written premiums and credit derivative revenues may differ from pvp due to factors including  but not limited to  changes in foreign exchange rates  prepayment speeds  terminations  credit defaults  or other factors that affect par outstanding or the ultimate maturity of an obligation

indirect exposure to selected european countries the company has included in the exposure tables above its indirect economic exposure to the selected european countries through insurance it provides on a pooled corporate and b commercial receivables transactions 
the company considers economic exposure to a selected european country to be indirect when that exposure relates to only a small portion of an insured transaction that otherwise is not related to that selected european country 
the company s pooled corporate obligations are highly diversified in terms of obligors and  except in the case of trups cdos or transactions backed by perpetual preferred securities perps  highly diversified in terms of industry 
most pooled corporate obligations are structured to limit exposure to any given obligor and any given non us country or region 
the insured pooled corporate transactions generally benefit from embedded credit enhancement which allows a transaction a certain level of losses in the underlying collateral without causing the company to pay a claim 
some pooled corporate obligations include investments in companies with a nexus to the selected european countries 
the company s commercial receivable transactions included in the exposure tables above are rail car lease transactions and aircraft lease transactions where some of the lessees have a nexus with the selected european countries 
like the pooled corporate transactions  the commercial receivable transactions generally benefit from embedded credit enhancement which allows a transaction a certain level of losses in the underlying collateral without causing the company to pay a claim

table of contents selected european countries the company follows and analyzes public information regarding developments in countries to which the company has exposure  including the selected european countries  and utilizes this information to evaluate risks in its financial guaranty portfolio 
because the company guarantees payments under its financial guaranty contracts  its analysis is focused primarily on the risk of payment defaults by these countries or obligors in these countries 
however  dramatic developments with respect to the selected european countries would also impact the fair value of insurance contracts accounted for as derivatives and with a nexus to those countries 
the hellenic republic of greece  recently downgraded on february  by s p from cc to sd selective default and rated ca by moody s  has experienced significant weakening of its economic and fiscal situation over the past three years  which in turn has led to multiple downgrades of its credit rating

identifying exposure to selected european countries when the company directly insures an obligation  it assigns the obligation to a geographic location or locations based on its view of the geographic location of the risk 
for most exposure this can be a relatively straight forward determination as  for example  a debt issue supported by availability payments for a toll road in a particular country 
the company may also assign portions of a risk to more than one geographic location as it has  for example  in a residential mortgage backed security backed by residential mortgage loans in both germany and italy 
the company may also have exposures to the selected european countries in business assumed from other monoline insurance companies 
see note  reinsurance and other monoline exposures of the financial statements and supplementary data 
in the case of assumed business  the company depends upon geographic information provided by the primary insurer 
the company also has indirect exposure to the selected european countries through structured finance transactions backed by pools of corporate obligations or receivables  such as lease payments  with a nexus to such countries 
in most instances  the trustees and or servicers for such transactions provide reports that identify the domicile of the underlying obligors in the pool and the company relies on such reports  although occasionally such information is not available to the company 
the company has reviewed transactions through which it believes it may have indirect exposure to the selected european countries that is material to the transaction and included in the tables above the proportion of the insured par equal to the proportion of obligors so identified as being domiciled in a selected european country 
the company may also have indirect exposures to selected european countries in business assumed from other monoline insurance companies

big exposures include all exposures with internal credit ratings below bbb 
the company s internal credit ratings are based on internal assessments of the likelihood of default and loss severity in the event of default 
the company s internal credit ratings are expressed on a ratings scale similar to that used by the rating agencies and generally reflect an approach similar to that employed by the rating agencies 
the company monitors its investment grade credits to determine whether any new credits need to be internally downgraded to big 
the company refreshes its internal credit ratings on individual credits in quarterly  semi annual or annual cycles based on the company s view of the credit s quality  loss potential  volatility and sector 
ratings on credits in sectors identified as under the most stress or with the most potential volatility are reviewed every quarter 
the company s insured credit ratings on assumed credits are based on the company s reviews of low rated credits or credits in volatile sectors  unless such information is not available  in which case  the ceding company s credit rating of the transactions are used 
for example  the company models all assumed rmbs credits with par above million  as well as certain rmbs credits below that amount 

table of contents credits identified as big are subjected to further review to determine the probability of a loss see results of operations consolidated results of operations losses in the insured portfolio above 
surveillance personnel then assign each big transaction to the appropriate big surveillance category based upon whether a lifetime loss is expected and whether a claim has been paid 
the company expects lifetime losses on a transaction when the company believes there is more than a chance that  on a present value basis  it will pay more claims over the life of that transaction than it will ultimately have been reimbursed 
for surveillance purposes  the company calculates present value using a constant discount rate of 
a risk free rate is used for recording of reserves for financial statement purposes 
a liquidity claim is a claim that the company expects to be reimbursed within one year 
intense monitoring and intervention is employed for all big surveillance categories  with internal credit ratings reviewed quarterly 
the three big categories are big category below investment grade transactions showing sufficient deterioration to make lifetime losses possible  but for which none are currently expected 
transactions on which claims have been paid but are expected to be fully reimbursed other than investment grade transactions on which only liquidity claims have been paid are in this category 
big category below investment grade transactions for which lifetime losses are expected but for which no claims other than liquidity claims have yet been paid

subordination in the following tables represents the sum of subordinate tranches and overcollateralization  expressed as a percentage of total transaction size and does not include any benefit from excess spread collections that may be used to absorb losses 
many of the closed end second lien rmbs transactions insured by the company have unique structures whereby the collateral may be written down for losses without a corresponding write down of the obligations insured by the company 
many of these transactions are currently undercollateralized  with the principal amount of collateral being less than the principal amount of the obligation insured by the company 
the company is not required to pay principal shortfalls until legal maturity rather than making timely principal payments  and takes the undercollateralization into account when estimating expected losses for these transactions

table of contents exposures by reinsurer ceded par outstanding represents the portion of insured risk ceded to other reinsurers 
under these relationships  the company cedes a portion of its insured risk in exchange for a premium paid to the reinsurer 
the company remains primarily liable for all risks it directly underwrites and is required to pay all gross claims 
it then seeks reimbursement from the reinsurer for its proportionate share of claims 
the company may be exposed to risk for this exposure if it were required to pay the gross claims and not be able to collect ceded claims from an assuming company experiencing financial distress 
a number of the financial guaranty insurers to which the company has ceded par have experienced financial distress and been downgraded by the rating agencies as a result 
in addition  state insurance regulators have intervened with respect to some of these insurers 
assumed par outstanding represents the amount of par assumed by the company from other monolines 
under these relationships  the company assumes a portion of the ceding company s insured risk in exchange for a premium 
the company may be exposed to risk in this portfolio in that the company may be required to pay losses without a corresponding premium in circumstances where the ceding company is experiencing financial distress and is unable to pay premiums 
in addition to assumed and ceded reinsurance arrangements  the company may also have exposure to some financial guaranty reinsurers ie monolines in other areas 
second to pay insured par outstanding represents transactions the company has insured that were previously insured by other monolines 
the company underwrites such transactions based on the underlying insured obligation without regard to the primary insurer 
another area of exposure is in the investment portfolio where the company holds fixed maturity securities that are wrapped by monolines and whose value may decline based on the rating of the monoline

liquidity requirements include the payment of operating expenses  interest on debt of agus and agmh and dividends on common shares 
agl and its holding company subsidiaries may also require liquidity to make periodic capital investments in its operating subsidiaries 
in the ordinary course of business  the company evaluates its liquidity needs and capital resources in light of holding company expenses and dividend policy  as well as rating agency considerations 
the company maintains a balance of its most liquid assets including cash and short term securities  treasuries  agency rmbs and pre refunded municipal bonds equal to times its projected operating company cash flow needs over the next four quarters 
the company also subjects its cash flow projections and its assets to a stress test maintaining a liquid asset balance of one time its stressed operating company net cash flows 
management believes that agl will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its needs over the next twelve months  including the ability to pay dividends on agl common shares 
see insurance company regulatory restrictions below for a discussion of dividend restrictions 
in addition  under the terms of the purchase agreement under which agmh was acquired  agm is subject to a dividend restriction until july  the company anticipates that for the next twelve months  amounts paid by agl s operating subsidiaries as dividends will be a major source of its liquidity 
it is possible that in the future  agl or its subsidiaries may need to seek additional external debt or equity financing in order to meet its obligations 
external sources of financing may or may not be available to the company  and if available  the cost of such financing may be higher than the company s current level

management believes that its subsidiaries liquidity needs for the next twelve months can be met from current cash  short term investments and operating cash flow  including premium collections and coupon payments as well as scheduled maturities and paydowns from their respective investment portfolios 
the company intends to hold and has the ability to hold temporarily impaired debt securities until the date of anticipated recovery 
beyond the next months  the ability of the operating subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends may be influenced by a variety of factors  including market conditions  insurance regulations and rating agency capital requirements and general economic conditions 

table of contents insurance policies issued provide  in general  that payments of principal  interest and other amounts insured may not be accelerated by the holder of the obligation 
amounts paid by the company therefore are typically in accordance with the obligation s original payment schedule or  at the company s option  may be on an accelerated basis 
cds may provide for acceleration of amounts due upon the occurrence of certain credit events  subject to single risk limits specified in the insurance laws of the state of new york the new york insurance law 
these constraints prohibit or limit acceleration of certain claims according to article of the new york insurance law and serve to reduce the company s liquidity requirements 
the company also has outstanding exposures to certain infrastructure transactions in its insured portfolio that may expose it to refinancing risk 
these transactions were entered into assuming they could be refinanced in the market prior to the expiration of the company s financial guaranty policy 
due to market dislocation and increased credit spreads the company may have to participate in these refinancings and then recover its payment from revenues produced by the transaction 
the company generally projects that in most scenarios it will be fully reimbursed for such payments 
the projected inflows and outflows are included in the company s financial guaranty insurance big transaction loss summary table in note  financial guaranty insurance contracts 
payments made in settlement of the company s obligations arising from its insured portfolio may  and often do  vary significantly from year to year  depending primarily on the frequency and severity of payment defaults and whether the company chooses to accelerate its payment obligations in order to mitigate future losses

the terms of the company s cds contracts generally are modified from standard cds contract forms approved by isda in order to provide for payments on a scheduled basis and to replicate the terms of a traditional financial guaranty insurance policy 
some contracts the company enters into as the credit protection seller  however  utilize standard isda settlement mechanics of cash settlement ie  a process to value the loss of market value of a reference obligation or physical settlement ie  delivery of the reference obligation against payment of principal by the protection seller in the event of a credit event  as defined in the relevant contract 
cash settlement or physical settlement generally requires the payment of a larger amount  prior to the maturity of the reference obligation  than would settlement on a pay as you go basis  under which the company would be required to pay scheduled interest shortfalls during the term of the reference obligation and scheduled principal shortfall only at the final maturity of the reference obligation 
the company s cds contracts also generally provide that if events of default or termination events specified in the cds documentation were to occur  the non defaulting or the non affected party  which may be either the company or the counterparty  depending upon the circumstances  may decide to terminate the cds contract prior to maturity 
the company may be required to make a termination payment to its swap counterparty upon such termination 
potential acceleration of claims with respect to cds obligations occur with funded cdos and synthetic cdos  as described below funded cdos the company has credit exposure to the senior tranches of funded corporate cdos 
the senior tranches are typically rated triple a at inception 
while the majority of these exposures obligate the company to pay only shortfalls in scheduled interest and principal at final maturity  in a limited number of cases the company has agreed to physical settlement following 
table of contents a credit event 
in these limited circumstances  the company has adhered to internal limits within applicable statutory single risk constraints 
in these transactions  the credit events giving rise to a payment obligation are a the bankruptcy of the special purpose issuer or b the failure by the issuer to make a scheduled payment of interest or principal pursuant to the referenced senior debt security 
synthetic cdos in the case of pooled corporate synthetic cdos  where the company s credit exposure was typically set at super senior levels at inception  the company is exposed to credit losses of a synthetic pool of corporate obligors following the exhaustion of a deductible 
in these transactions  losses are typically calculated using isda cash settlement mechanics 
as a result  the company s exposures to the individual corporate obligors within any synthetic transaction are constrained by the new york insurance law single risk limits 
in these transactions  the credit events giving rise to a payment obligation are generally a the reference entity s bankruptcy  b failure by the reference entity to pay its debt obligations  and c in certain transactions  the restructuring of the reference entity s debt obligations 
the company generally would not be required to make a payment until aggregate credit losses exceed the designated deductible threshold and only as each incremental default occurs 
once the deductible is exhausted  each further credit event would give rise to cash settlements

debt issued by agm notes payable represent debt  issued by special purpose entities consolidated by agm  to the financial products companies transferred to dexia holdings prior to the agmh acquisition 
the funds borrowed were used to finance the purchase of the underlying obligations of agm insured obligations which had breached triggers allowing agm to exercise its right to accelerate payment of a claim in order to mitigate loss 
the assets purchased are classified as assets acquired in refinancing transactions and recorded in other invested assets 
the term of the notes payable matches the terms of the assets 
recourse credit facilities strip coverage facility in connection with the agmh acquisition  agm agreed to retain the risks relating to the debt and strip policy portions of the leveraged lease business 
the liquidity risk to agm related to the strip policy portion of the leveraged lease business is mitigated by the strip coverage facility described below 
in a leveraged lease transaction  a tax exempt entity such as a transit agency transfers tax benefits to a tax paying entity by transferring ownership of a depreciable asset  such as subway cars 
the tax exempt entity then leases the asset back from its new owner 
if the lease is terminated early  the tax exempt entity must make an early termination payment to the lessor 
a portion of this early termination payment is funded from monies that were pre funded and invested at the closing of the leveraged lease transaction along with earnings on those invested funds 
the tax exempt entity is obligated to pay the remaining  unfunded portion of this early termination payment known as the strip coverage from its own sources 
agm issued financial guaranty insurance policies known as strip policies that guaranteed the payment of these unfunded strip coverage amounts to the lessor  in the event that a tax exempt entity defaulted on its obligation to pay this portion of its early termination payment 
agm can then seek reimbursement of its strip policy payments from the tax exempt entity  and can also sell the transferred depreciable asset and reimburse itself from the sale proceeds 
one event that may lead to an early termination of a lease is the downgrade of agm  as the strip coverage provider  or the downgrade of the equity payment undertaker within the transaction  in each case  generally to a financial strength rating below double a 
upon such downgrade  the tax exempt entity is generally obligated to find a replacement credit enhancer within a specified period of time  failure to find a replacement could result in a lease default  and failure to cure the default within a specified period of time could lead to an early termination of the lease and a demand by the lessor for 
table of contents a termination payment from the tax exempt entity 
however  even in the event of an early termination of the lease  there would not necessarily be an automatic draw on agm s policy  as this would only occur to the extent the tax exempt entity does not make the required termination payment 
aig international group  inc is one entity that has acted as equity payment undertaker in a number of transactions in which agm acted as strip coverage provider 
aig was downgraded in the third quarter of and agm was downgraded by moody s in the fourth quarter of as a result of those downgrades  as of december   leveraged lease transactions in which agm acts as strip coverage provider were breaching either a ratings trigger related to aig or a ratings trigger related to agm 
for such leveraged lease transactions  if early termination of the leases were to occur and the tax exempt entities do not make the required early termination payments  then agm would be exposed to possible liquidity claims on gross exposure of approximately billion as of december  s p s downgrade of agm to aa in november did not have an additional impact on the transactions 
however  if agm were downgraded to a by s p or a by moody s  as of december   another leveraged lease transactions in which agm acts as strip coverage provider would be affected 
for such leveraged lease transactions  if early termination of the leases were to occur and the tax exempt entities do not make the required early termination payments  then agm would be exposed to possible liquidity claims on gross exposure of an additional approximately million as of december  to date  none of the leveraged lease transactions which involve agm has experienced an early termination due to a lease default and a claim on the agm guaranty 
it is difficult to determine the probability that the company will have to pay strip provider claims or the likely aggregate amount of such claims 
at december   approximately million of cumulative strip par exposure had been terminated on a consensual basis 
the consensual terminations have resulted in no claims on agm

the commitment amount of the strip coverage facility was billion at closing of the agmh acquisition but is scheduled to amortize over time 
as of december   the maximum commitment amount of the strip coverage facility has amortized to million 
it may also be reduced in to million  if agm does not have a specified consolidated net worth at that time 
fundings under this facility are subject to certain conditions precedent  and their repayment is collateralized by a security interest that agm granted to dexia cr dit local ny in amounts that agm recovers from the tax exempt entity  or from asset sale proceeds following its payment of strip policy claims

the gics were issued through agmh s non insurance subsidiaries the gic issuers fsa capital management services llc  fsa capital markets services llc and fsa capital markets services caymans ltd 
in return for an initial payment  each gic entitles its holder to receive the return of the holder s invested principal plus interest at a specified rate  and to withdraw principal from the gic as permitted by its terms 
agm insures the gic issuer s payment obligations on all gics issued by the applicable gic issuer 
the proceeds of gics issued by the gic issuers were loaned to agmh s former subsidiary fsam pursuant to certain intercompany financing agreements between the gic issuers and fsam the intercompany financings 
fsam in turn invested these funds in fixed income obligations primarily residential mortgage backed securities  but also short term investments  securities issued or guaranteed by us government sponsored agencies  taxable municipal bonds  securities issued by utilities  infrastructure related securities  collateralized debt obligations  other asset backed securities and foreign currency denominated securities that satisfied agm s investment criteria the fsam assets 
the terms governing fsam s repayment of gic proceeds to the gic issuers under the intercompany financings were intended to match the payment terms under the related gic 
fsam historically depended in large part on operating cash flow from interest and principal payments on the fsam assets to provide sufficient liquidity to pay the gics on a timely basis 
fsam also sought to manage the financial products business liquidity risk through the maintenance of liquid collateral and liquidity agreements 
during the course of  agmh s former financial products business developed significant liquidity shortfalls as a result of a number of factors  including i greater than anticipated gic withdrawals and terminations due  for the most part  to redemptions caused by events of default under collateralized debt obligations backed by asset backed securities and under collateralized loan obligations  ii slower than anticipated amortization of residential mortgage backed securities  which comprised most of the portfolio of fsam assets  iii redemption collateralization requirements triggered by the downgrade of agm s financial strength ratings  and iv a significant decline in market value of certain of the fsam assets due to a general market dislocation  leading to many of the fsam assets becoming illiquid 
prior to the completion of the agmh acquisition  agmh sold its ownership interest in the gic issuers and fsam to dexia holdings 
even though agmh no longer owns the gic issuers or fsam  
table of contents agm s guarantees of the gics remain in place  and must remain in place until each gic is terminated 
in connection with the agmh acquisition and as further described below  dexia sa  dexia holdings ultimate parent  and certain of its affiliates have entered into a number of agreements pursuant to which they have guaranteed certain amounts  agreed to lend certain amounts or post liquid collateral  and agreed to provide hedges against interest rate risk to or in respect of agmh s former financial products business  including the gic business 
the purpose of these agreements is to mitigate the credit  interest rate and liquidity risks described above that are primarily associated with the gic business and the related agm guarantees 
these agreements include a guaranty jointly and severally issued by dexia sa and dcl to agm that guarantees the payment obligations of agm under its policies related to the gic business  and an indemnification agreement between agm  dexia sa and dcl that protects agm from other losses arising out of or as a result of the gic business  as well as the liquidity facilities and the swap agreements described below 
on june   to support the payment obligations of fsam and the gic issuers  each of dexia sa and dcl entered into two separate isda master agreements  each with its associated schedule  confirmation and credit support annex the guaranteed put contract and the non guaranteed put contract respectively  and collectively  the dexia put contracts  the economic effect of which is that dexia sa and dcl jointly and severally guarantee the scheduled payments of interest and principal in relation to each fsam asset  as well as any failure of dexia to provide liquidity or liquid collateral under the committed liquidity lending facilities provided by dexia affiliates 
the dexia put contracts referenced separate portfolios of fsam assets to which assets owned by fsam as of september  were allocated  with the less liquid assets and the assets with the lowest mark to market values generally being allocated to the guaranteed put contract 
on may   dexia issued a press release announcing the acceleration of its asset divestment program as part of the financial restructuring of its group 
since such announcement  through december   dexia has exercised its par call option under the guaranteed put contract  over time  with respect to all of the fsam assets covered thereby and transferred to fsam an amount of cash equal to the par value of such assets 
as a result  the credit  interest rate and liquidity protection provided by the guaranteed put contract effectively terminated when the last fsam asset covered thereby was sold 
separately  pursuant to the non guaranteed put contract  fsam may put an amount of fsam assets to dexia sa and dcl in exchange for funds in an amount generally equal to the lesser of a the outstanding principal balance of the gics and b the shortfall related to i the failure of a dexia party to provide liquidity or collateral as required under the committed liquidity lending facilities provided by dexia affiliates  as described below a liquidity default trigger  or ii the failure by either dexia sa or dcl to transfer the required amount of eligible collateral under the credit support annex of the non guaranteed put contract a collateral default trigger  in exchange for funds in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of an fsam asset with respect to which any of the following events have occurred an asset default trigger a the issuer of such fsam asset fails to pay the full amount of the expected interest when due or to pay the full amount of the expected principal when due following expiration of any grace period or within five business days following the scheduled due date  b a writedown or applied loss results in a reduction of the outstanding principal amount  or c the attribution of a principal deficiency or realized loss results in a reduction or subordination of the current interest payable on such fsam asset  provided  that dexia sa and dcl have the right to elect to pay only the difference between the amount of the expected principal or interest payment and the amount of the actual principal or 
table of contents interest payment  in each case  as such amounts come due  rather than paying an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of applicable fsam asset  and or in exchange for funds in an amount equal to the lesser of a the aggregate outstanding principal amount of all fsam assets and b the aggregate outstanding principal balance of all of the gics  upon the occurrence of an insolvency event with respect to dexia sa as set forth in the non guaranteed put contract a bankruptcy trigger 
to secure the non guaranteed put contract  dexia sa and dcl will  pursuant to the credit support annex thereto  post eligible highly liquid collateral having an aggregate value subject to agreed reductions equal to at least the excess of i the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding gics over ii the aggregate mark to market value of fsam s assets 
the agreed to reductions applicable to the value of fsam assets range from to percent for obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  sovereign obligations of the united kingdom  germany  the netherlands  france or belgium  obligations guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and for mortgage securities issued or guaranteed by us sponsored agencies  and range from to for the other fsam assets 
as of december   the aggregate accreted gic balance was approximately billion 
as of the same date  with respect to the fsam assets covered by the non guaranteed put contract  the aggregate accreted principal balance was approximately billion  the aggregate market value was approximately billion and the aggregate market value after agreed reductions was approximately billion 
cash and net derivative value constituted another billion of assets 
accordingly  as of december   the aggregate fair value after agreed reductions of the assets supporting the gic business exceeded the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding gics and certain other business and hedging costs of the gic business 
therefore  no posting of collateral was required under the credit support annex applicable to the non guaranteed put contract 
under the terms of that credit support annex  the collateral posting is recalculated on a weekly basis according to the formula set forth in the credit support annex  and a collateral posting is required whenever the collateralization levels tested by the formula are not satisfied  subject to a threshold of up to million 
to provide additional support to the gic issuers ability to pay their gic obligations when due  dexia affiliates have agreed to assume the risk of loss and support the payment obligations of the gic subsidiaries in respect of the gics and the gic business by providing liquidity commitments to lend against the fsam assets 
the term of the commitments will generally extend until the gics have been paid in full 
the liquidity commitments comprise i an amended and restated revolving credit agreement the liquidity facility pursuant to which dcl and dexia bank belgium sa commit to provide funds to fsam in an amount up to billion approximately billion of which was outstanding as of december   and ii a master repurchase agreement the repurchase facility agreement and  together with the liquidity facility  the guaranteed liquidity facilities pursuant to which dcl will provide up to billion of funds in exchange for the transfer by fsam to dcl of fsam securities that are not eligible to satisfy collateralization obligations of the gic issuers under the gics 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under the repurchase facility agreement 
the failure of the dexia affiliates to perform on the guaranteed liquidity facilities will trigger dexia sa s and dcl s obligations to purchase fsam assets under the non guaranteed put contract  as described above 
despite the execution of the non guaranteed put contract and the guaranteed liquidity facilities  and the significant portion of fsam assets comprised of highly liquid securities backed by the full faith and credit of the united states as of december  approximately of the fsam assets measured by aggregate principal balance was in cash or were obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states  agm remains subject to the risk that dexia may not make payments or securities available i on a timely basis  which is referred to as liquidity risk  or ii at all  which is referred to as credit risk  because of the risk of default 
even if dexia has sufficient assets to pay all amounts when due  concerns regarding dexia s financial condition or willingness to comply with their obligations could cause one or more rating agencies to view negatively the ability or 
table of contents willingness of dexia and its affiliates to perform under their various agreements and could negatively affect agm s ratings 
if dexia or its affiliates do not fulfill the contractual obligations  the financial products companies may not have the financial ability to pay upon the withdrawal of gic funds or post collateral or make other payments in respect of the gics  thereby resulting in claims upon the agm financial guaranty insurance policies 
if agm is required to pay a claim due to a failure of the gic subsidiaries to pay amounts in respect of the gics  agm is subject to the risk that the gics will not be paid from funds received from dexia before it is required to make payment under its financial guaranty policies or that it will not receive the guaranty payment at all 
one situation in which agm may be required to pay claims in respect of agmh s former financial products business if dexia and its affiliates do not comply with their obligations is if agm is downgraded 
most of the gics insured by agm allow for the withdrawal of gic funds in the event of a downgrade of agm  unless the relevant gic issuer posts collateral or otherwise enhances its credit 
most gics insured by agm allow for the termination of the gic contract and a withdrawal of gic funds at the option of the gic holder in the event of a downgrade of agm below a specified threshold  generally below a by s p or a by moody s  with no right of the gic issuer to avoid such withdrawal by posting collateral or otherwise enhancing its credit 
each gic contract stipulates the thresholds below which the gic provider must post eligible collateral along with the types of securities eligible for posting and the collateralization percentage applicable to each security type 
these collateralization percentages range from of the gic balance for cash posted as collateral to  typically  for asset backed securities 
at december   a downgrade of agm to below aa by s p and aa by moody s ie  a by s p and a by moody s would result in withdrawal of million of gic funds and the need to post collateral on gics with a balance of billion 
in the event of such a downgrade  assuming an average margin of  the market value as of december  that the gic issuers would be required to post in order to avoid withdrawal of any gic funds would be billion

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of adverse changes in earnings  cash flow or fair value as a result of changes in the value of financial instruments 
the company s primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit spread risk 
the company s primary exposure to market risk is summarized below the fair value of credit derivatives within the financial guaranty portfolio of insured obligations which fluctuate based on changes in credit spreads of the underlying obligations and the company s own credit spreads 
the investment portfolio s fair value is primarily driven by changes in interest rates and also affected by changes in credit spreads 
the investment portfolio also contains foreign denominated securities whose value fluctuates based on changes in foreign exchange rates 
the fair value of the assets and liabilities of consolidated fg vie s may fluctuate based on changes in prepayment spreads  default rates  interest rates  and house price depreciation appreciation 
sensitivity of credit derivatives to credit risk unrealized gains and losses on credit derivatives are a function of changes in the estimated fair value of the company s credit derivative contracts 
if credit spreads of the underlying obligations change  the fair value of the related credit derivative changes 
market liquidity could also impact valuations of the underlying obligations 
as such  assured guaranty experiences mark to market gains or losses 
the company considers the impact of its own credit risk  together with credit spreads on the risk that it assumes through cds contracts  in determining their fair value 
the company determines its own credit risk based on quoted cds prices traded on the company at each balance sheet date 
the quoted price of cds contracts traded on agc at december  and december  was  bps and bps  respectively 
the quoted price of cds contracts traded on agm at december  and december  was bps and bps  respectively 
historically  the price of cds traded on agc and agm moves directionally the same as general market spreads 
generally  a widening of the cds prices traded on agc and agm has an effect of offsetting unrealized losses that result from widening general market credit spreads  while a narrowing of the cds prices traded on agc and agm has an effect of offsetting unrealized gains that result from narrowing general market credit spreads 
an overall narrowing of spreads generally results in an unrealized gain on credit derivatives for the company and an overall widening of spreads generally results in an unrealized loss for the company 
the impact of changes in credit spreads will vary based upon the volume  tenor  interest rates  and other market conditions at the time these fair values are determined 
in addition  since each transaction has unique collateral and structure terms  the underlying change in fair value of each transaction may vary considerably 
the fair value of credit derivative contracts also reflects the change in the company s own credit cost  based on the price to purchase credit protection on agc and agm 
the company generally holds these credit derivative contracts to maturity 
the unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments will reduce to zero as the exposure approaches its maturity date  unless there is a payment default on the exposure or early termination 
given these facts  the company does not actively hedge these exposures 
the following table summarizes the 
table of contents estimated change in fair values on the net balance of the company s cds positions assuming immediate parallel shifts in credit spreads on agc and agm and on the risks that they both assume as of december  credit spreads estimated net fair value pre tax estimated change in gain loss pre tax in millions widening in spreads widening in spreads widening in spreads widening in spreads base scenario narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads as of december  credit spreads estimated net fair value pre tax estimated change in gain loss pre tax in millions widening in spreads widening in spreads widening in spreads widening in spreads base scenario narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads narrowing in spreads includes the effects of spreads on both the underlying asset classes and the company s own credit spread 
sensitivity of investment portfolio to interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that financial instruments values will change due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates  in the spread between two rates  in the shape of the yield curve or in any other interest rate relationship 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily in its investment portfolio 
as interest rates rise for an available for sale investment portfolio  the fair value of fixed income securities decreases 
the company s policy is generally to hold assets in the investment portfolio to maturity 
therefore  barring credit deterioration  interest rate movements do not result in realized gains or losses unless assets are sold prior to maturity 
the company does not hedge interest rate risk  however  interest rate fluctuation risk is managed through the investment guidelines which limit duration and prevent investment in high volatility sectors 
interest rate sensitivity in the investment portfolio can be estimated by projecting a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates 
the following table presents the estimated pre tax change in fair value of the company s investment portfolio from instantaneous parallel shifts in interest rates 
sensitivity to change in interest rates on the investment portfolio as of december  change in interest rates basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase in millions estimated change in fair value 
table of contents as of december  change in interest rates basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point decrease basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase in millions estimated change in fair value sensitivity of other areas to interest rate risk fluctuation in interest rates also affects the demand for the company s product 
when interest rates are lower or when the market is otherwise relatively less risk averse  the spread between insured and uninsured obligations typically narrows and  as a result  financial guaranty insurance typically provides lower cost savings to issuers than it would during periods of relatively wider spreads 
these lower cost savings generally lead to a corresponding decrease in demand and premiums obtainable for financial guaranty insurance 
conversely  in a deteriorating credit environment  credit spreads widen and pricing for financial guaranty insurance typically improves 
however  if the weakening environment is sudden  pronounced or prolonged  the stresses on the insured portfolio may result in claims payments in excess of normal or historical expectations 
in addition  increases in prevailing interest rate levels can lead to a decreased volume of capital markets activity and  correspondingly  a decreased volume of insured transactions 
sensitivity of investment portfolio to foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange risk is the risk that a financial instrument s value will change due to a change in the foreign currency exchange rates 
the company has foreign denominated securities in its investment portfolio 
securities denominated in currencies other than us dollar were and of the investment portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
the company s material exposure is to changes in the dollar pound sterling exchange rate 
changes in fair value of available for sale investments attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded in oci

premium receivables denominated in currencies other than us dollar were and of the premium receivable balance as of december  and  respectively 
the company s material exposure is to changes in dollar pound sterling and dollar euro exchange rates 

table of contents sensitivity to change in foreign exchange rates on premium receivable as of december  change in foreign exchange rates decrease decrease decrease increase increase increase in millions estimated change in fair value as of december  change in foreign exchange rates decrease decrease decrease increase increase increase in millions estimated change in fair value sensitivity of fg vie assets and liabilities to market risk the fair value of the company s fg vie assets is sensitive to changes relating to estimated prepayment speeds  estimated default rates determined on the basis of an analysis of collateral attributes such as historical collateral performance  borrower profiles and other features relevant to the evaluation of collateral credit quality  recoveries from excess spread  discount rates implied by market prices for similar securities  and house price depreciation appreciation rates based on macroeconomic forecasts 
significant changes to any of these inputs could materially change the market value of the fg vie s assets and the implied collateral losses within the transaction 
in general the fair value of the fg vie assets is most sensitive to changes in the projected collateral losses  where an increase in collateral losses typically leads to a decrease in the fair value of the company s fg vie assets  while a decrease in collateral losses typically leads to an increase in the fair value of the company s fg vie assets 
these factors also directly impact the fair value of the company s uninsured fg vie liabilities 
the fair value of the company s insured fg vie liabilities is also sensitive to changes relating to estimated prepayment speeds  market values of the assets that collateralize the securities  estimated default rates determined on the basis of an analysis of collateral attributes such as historical collateral performance  borrower profiles and other features relevant to the evaluation of collateral credit quality  recoveries from excess spread  discount rates implied by market prices for similar securities  and house price depreciation appreciation rates based on macroeconomic forecasts 
in addition  the company s insured fg vie liabilities are also sensitive to changes to the company s implied credit worthiness 
significant changes to any of these inputs could materially change the timing of expected losses within the insured transaction which is a significant factor in determining the implied benefit from the company s insurance policy guaranteeing the timely payment of principal and interest for the fg vie tranches insured by the company 
in general  when the timing of expected loss payments by the company is extended into the future  this typically leads to a decrease in the value of the company s insurance and a decrease in the fair value of the company s insured fg vie liabilities  while a shortening of the timing of expected loss payments by the company typically leads to an increase in the value of the company s insurance and an increase in the fair value of the company s insured fg vie liabilities
