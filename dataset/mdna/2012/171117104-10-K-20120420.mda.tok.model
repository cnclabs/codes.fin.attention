shipments of residential furniture in were lower than reflecting the impact of weakness in consumer demand for residential products in our price segment which we believe is consistent with industry trends  the continuing economic downturn which reflects the ongoing labor and housing market struggles and high levels of consumer debt  and import competition 
the decrease in residential sales in as compared to was primarily due to lower sales of occasional furniture  and to a lesser extent dining room furniture  partially offset by higher sales of bedroom furniture due to the introduction of a new bedroom line that began shipping in the second quarter of commercial furniture shipments were higher in as compared to the prior year due to an increase in shipments of seating products to government agencies  higher education institutions and the health care industry

the new facility includes a lockbox service agreement whereby all payments received by the company to the lockbox are transferred directly to gibraltar s general funding account for application to any outstanding loan balance the company has with gibraltar 

index we believe that our available line of credit under our new facility will be adequate to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital purposes and normal capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance regarding these matters given the current state of the global economy  which has negatively impacted our ability to accurately forecast our results of operations and cash position  and which may result in deterioration of our revenues from what we anticipate 
we believe further deterioration in revenues would expose us to declining margins as a result of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing overhead  operating inefficiencies and an imbalance between our inventory levels and customer demand which would likely result in continued losses and reduced liquidity 
additionally  if our trade creditors were to impose unfavorable terms on us  it would negatively impact our ability to obtain raw materials  products and services on acceptable terms 
we have implemented expense controls and limitations on capital expenditures to conserve cash during the current economic downturn 
because we presently are incurring losses  the continued availability of credit under our new facility is important to meet our liquidity needs 
the company expects to borrow under the new facility on a limited basis in we will need to generate adequate cash flow from operations in future periods in order to meet our long term liquidity needs 
in the absence of adequate cash flow from operations in the future  the company may need to further restrict expenditures  sell assets  seek additional business funding or consider other alternatives 
our ability to obtain additional funding would likely be adversely affected because all of our assets have been secured as collateral for our new facility and because our financial results could adversely affect the availability and terms of any such funding 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements of the company requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the related footnotes 
we consider the following accounting policies to be most significantly impacted by the estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the related receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collectability of trade receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on our analysis of customer credit worthiness  historical loss experience  and general economic conditions and trends 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventories for excess or slow moving items based on sales order activity and expected market changes 
if circumstances indicate the cost of inventories exceeds their recoverable value  inventories are reduced to net realizable value 
employee related benefits accounting for self insured health care and workers compensation liabilities involves assumptions of expected claims based on past experience and a review of individual claims 
we establish a liability based on claim information supplied by insurance and third party administrators 
actual claim expense could differ from the estimates made by the company 

index property  plant and equipment we review long lived assets for impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in facts and circumstances indicate the possibility that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
factors that may trigger an impairment evaluation include under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the forecast of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value 
if a possible impairment is identified  the asset group s fair value is measured relying primarily on a discounted cash flow methodology 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and include net operating loss tax carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we review relevant factors  including recent operating results  the likelihood of the utilization of net operating loss tax carryforwards and the ability to generate future taxable income to determine if deferred income taxes are recoverable and if a valuation reserve is required 
the company and its wholly owned us subsidiary file a consolidated federal income tax return 
the company is subject to the income tax laws of the united states and the states in which the company operates 
the manner in which these tax laws apply to the taxpayer s facts is sometimes open to interpretation 
therefore  the company must make judgments in assessing the likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position 
a tax position is recognized only when  based on management s judgment regarding the application of income tax laws  it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the amount of benefit recognized for financial reporting purposes is based on management s best judgment of the most likely outcome resulting from examination given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
the company adjusts the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is new information available to assess the likelihood of the outcome 
asc liabilities for uncertain tax positions are included in other long term liabilities 
accrued interest and penalties for unrecognized tax positions are recorded in income tax expense 
recently issued accounting standards there have been no recent accounting standards or changes in accounting standards during the year ended december   that are of significance  or potential significance to the company  as compared to the recent accounting standards described in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december
