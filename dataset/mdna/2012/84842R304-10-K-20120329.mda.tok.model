item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company operates via two segments  biospherics and health sciences 
biospherics seeks to develop proprietary pharmaceutical products 
health sciences provides technical and regulatory consulting services to food  consumer products  biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as providing technical support to the biospherics segment 
biospherics is dedicated to development of pharmaceuticals 
recently  the company has focused its studies on treating high triglycerides and other dyslipidemias with a combination of d tagatose and spx  a licensed drug compound  which combination is referred to as spx t 
animal studies of spx t are ongoing and an initial human efficacy study could begin in mid tagatose  a naturally occurring sugar  is a low calorie  full bulk sweetener previously approved by the food and drug administration fda as a gras generally recognized as safe food ingredient 
it is a true sugar that looks  feels  and tastes like table sugar 
during human safety studies supporting food use  we discovered and patented a number of health and medical uses for d tagatose 
until june  development was limited to developing d tagatose as a novel  first in class treatment for type diabetes 
in june  the company announced that it would seek a pharma partner to continue the diabetes development and that it would also explore d tagatose as a potential treatment for high triglycerides  a risk factor for atherosclerosis  myocardial infarction  and stroke 
the company has begun such exploration and is also evaluating other drug compounds it has licensed from the ukrf 
the company is also exploring the possibility of increasing its pipeline of potential products by obtaining by license or acquisition other clinical stage compounds orphan drugs for continued development and commercialization 
orphan drug status by the fda is usually applied to products where the number of patients in the united states in the given disease category is typically less than  the european medicines agency adopted a similar system termed the regulation of orphan medicinal products 
these orphan drug indications typically require more modest investment in the development stages  followed by a quicker regulatory path to approval 
we have incurred negative cash flow from operations each of the most recent fiscal years 
we anticipate incurring negative cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future 
we have spent  and expect to continue to spend  substantial amounts in connection with implementing our business strategy  including our product development efforts 
results of operations compared with revenue and direct costs revenue and direct contract costs are primarily related to the company s health sciences business 
the consulting business generally provides services on either a fixed price basis or a time and expenses basis  charging hourly rates for each staff member involved in a project  based on his or her skills and experience 
engagement agreements typically provide for monthly billing and payment within thirty days of receipt  and permit clients to terminate engagements at any time 
the health sciences consulting staff also provides support for our r d activities and the decrease in direct costs of  between years reflects an increase in the staff s time devoted to developing study protocols and other support for the company s r d activities see research and development below 
this shift in resources accounted for approximately half of the  decrease in revenue between years 
lower effective rates on contracts in comparison to contracts accounted for the rest of the decrease in revenue between years as a result of changing demand in the market for health science based consulting services 
during and  health sciences provided services to and companies  respectively 
no substantial revenue is expected from the biospherics segment until the company is successful in selling or licensing its technology 
research and development research and development expenditures relate solely to the biospherics segment and consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  and other expenses related to our efforts to develop d tagatose and spx t for future commercialization 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
the clinical trials in the use of d tagatose for the treatment of type diabetes was the primary focus of the biospherics segment during beginning in the fourth quarter of  the company began shifting the focus of its r d efforts to the use of spx t in lowering triglyceride and cholesterol levels 
the shift from late stage trials to a pre clinical trial resulted in a decrease in r d costs between years  the company anticipates that r d costs will begin to increase again with the progression of triglyceride and cholesterol studies 
an application for an investigational new drug ind for the d tagatose and spx combination drug is being prepared for submission to the us fda  and a human proof of concept trial may begin in mid combination therapy is an important tool in many complex disease settings  including cancer  infectious diseases  cardiovascular disease  diabetes and the metabolic syndrome 
scientific progress has increased understanding of the pathophysiological processes that underlie these and other multifactorial diseases 
this increased knowledge has advanced new therapeutic approaches using combinations of drugs targeted at multiple therapeutic targets to improve treatment response and or minimize development of drug resistance 
in settings like metabolic syndrome  in which combination therapy may offer significant therapeutic advantages  there is increasing interest in the development of combinations of investigational drugs not previously developed for any purpose 
we estimate that it will likely take or more years to complete the studies trials necessary to attract a pharma partner to complete the development and an additional years to complete all necessary studies for an nda filing for d tagatose or spx t 
the company is seeking to in license or acquire additional drugs to diversify its pipeline 
clinical stage compounds phase or phase are of particular interest  as are orphan drugs  which can be eligible for accelerated approval processes 
as noted  the phase trial to determine efficacy of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes and the phase dose range trial to evaluate the effectiveness of lower doses of d tagatose in treating type diabetes were both completed in late selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including facilities related expenses 
s  g a expenses for decreased  from those of the prior year 
the decrease between years was primarily attributable to a scaling down of the company s business development activities for the use of d tagatose as a treatment for type diabetes  which included consultants  market research and other related costs 
the company expects that it will see an increase in s  g a costs in as we seek  investigate and pursue opportunities to expand our research and development pipeline 
interest income interest income in and was primarily derived from interest earned on the net proceeds of our equity offerings 
the decrease in interest income between years is attributable to the decrease in funds available for investing 
other income in october  the company was awarded two one time grants from the us government under the patient protection and affordable care act 
the awards were for the company s and diabetes and triglyceride research 
as a result  in and the company recognized  and  in other income  net of a related tax expense of  and tax benefit of  respectively 
gain on settlement of obligations on january   biospherics incorporated  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  filed a complaint for injunction relief and damages in the united states district court for the district of maryland against inalco spa the complaint 
the complaint alleged that inalco had breached the manufacturing support and supply agreement as inalco i refused to supply d tagatose previously paid for by biospherics  ii refused to provide a promised bank guarantee  and iii shut down its d tagatose production facilities 
on march   both parties signed a settlement agreement whereby inalco agreed to supply spherix with metric tons of d tagatose  which has been received by spherix  and both parties have agreed to release each other from any other obligations under the previous agreement 
as a result  the company recognized a gain of  in march on the release from its purchase obligation 
in january  the company entered into a letter agreement with gilbert v 
levin and m 
karen levin pursuant to which the company agreed to make a one time lump sum payment of  to the levins in full satisfaction of the company s obligation to make a series of continuing payments to the levins relating to their prior employment by the company 
per the terms of the agreement  gilbert v 
levin resigned as a member of the board of directors of the company on january  the company s estimated liability to the levins at december   and prior to the above agreement was approximately  the  lump sum payment was made on january   and the company recognized the  difference as a gain on settlement of obligations in january income tax expense benefit the income tax expense and the income tax benefit was directly related to the above mentioned us government grants in the other income discussion 
sales backlog the company s backlog as of december  and consisting solely of backlog from the health sciences business was approximately  and  respectively 
the company bills for its consulting services primarily on a time and expense basis and these amounts represent estimated contract values 
further  the company s consulting contracts are generally terminable or subject to postponement or delay at any time by clients 
as a result  backlog at any particular time is not a reliable indicator of revenues for any future periods 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of the contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses for the period reported 
estimates are based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated periodically and form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue and expenses 
actual results may differ substantially from these estimates 
spherix s critical accounting policies are those it believes are the most important in determining its financial condition and results  and require significant subjective judgment by management as a result of inherent uncertainties 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
such policies are discussed below 
accounting for taxes and valuation allowances we currently have significant deferred tax assets  resulting from net operating loss carry forwards 
these deferred tax assets may reduce taxable income in future periods 
based on the company s losses and its accumulated deficit  the company has provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset 
cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment of valuation allowances 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained  or we are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
we are required to adopt this standard in the first quarter of we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard on the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
in december  the fasb deferred the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income  while still requiring entities to adopt the other requirements 
we are required to adopt this standard as of the beginning of we do not expect this adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we expect to continue to incur substantial development costs in our biospherics segment in the next several years  without substantial corresponding revenue  and we will continue to incur ongoing administrative and other expenses  including public company expenses 
we intend to finance our activities through the remaining proceeds of our equity offerings  and additional funds we will seek to raise through the sale of additional stock in the future 
working capital was million at december   including million cash on hand 
management believes that this cash on hand  combined with the million of net proceeds of the february offering  provide us with sufficient cash to sustain operations for we expect that we will need to expend approximately million over the next twelve months to support our currently planned development operations 
this estimate assumes i no further significant expenditures for developing d tagatose as a drug for diabetes  ii continuing development of d tagatose as a treatment for high triglycerides and other dyslipidemias  iii ongoing operation of the health sciences segment at the current level of activity and iv that we raise additional funds to continue our development efforts beyond this month period 
due to the nature of our business  we will need to raise additional funds on a consistent basis to continue operations  to fully pursue the triglycerides and other dyslipidemias opportunity  and to seek  investigate  pursue and exploit other pipeline development opportunities 
fundraising will likely require the issuance of additional equity securities and a purchaser of such securities will likely insist that such securities be registered securities 
nasdaq rules require stockholder approval for certain stock issuances constituting twenty percent or more of a company s issued and outstanding stock 
the company has a form s shelf registration statement that is currently effective 
however  it is unlikely that the company will be able to use this shelf registration statement for another significant offering prior to its expiration on october  following the expiration of this registration  the company will need to obtain another registration statement to become effective 
the company cannot be assured that it will be able to attract a purchaser of securities to raise the additional funds it will likely require  that the company will be able to obtain any required stockholder approval  or that the company will be able to have additional registered direct primary offerings 
if we reach a point where we are unable to raise needed additional funds to continue our business activities  we will be forced to cease our development activities and dissolve the company 
in such an event  we will need to satisfy various severance  lease termination and other dissolution related obligations
