table of contents a depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization includes amounts related to purchased software  capitalized website development costs  internally developed software  and acquired intangible assets 
b ebitda consists of net income attributable to capella education company minus other income  net plus income tax expense and plus depreciation and amortization 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on marketable securities  net of any interest expense for amortization of debt issuance costs 
we use ebitda as a measure of operating performance 
however  ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and when analyzing our operating performance  investors should use ebitda in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax payments 
we believe ebitda is useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and liquidity because it is widely used to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets 
we believe ebitda presents a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired 
our management uses ebitda as a measurement of operating performance  because it assists us in comparing our performance on a consistent basis  as it removes depreciation  amortization  interest and taxes  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as is used by management to compare our current operating results with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to ebitda year ended december  in thousands net income attributable to capella education company other income  net income tax expense depreciation and amortization ebitda c free cash flow is derived by deducting capital expenditures from cash flow from operating activities as presented in the statement of cash flows under gaap 
we use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance 
however  free cash flow is not a recognized measurement under gaap  and when analyzing our cash generating ability  investors should use free cash flow in addition to  and not as an alternative for  cash flow from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

table of contents we believe free cash flow is a meaningful measure to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to assess our cash generating capabilities 
we believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives 
management uses free cash flow as an indicator of the company s cash generating capabilities after considering investments in capital assets which are necessary to maintain and enhance existing operations 
cash flow from operating activities adds back non cash depreciation expense to earnings and thereby does not reflect a charge for necessary capital expenditures  and in presentations to the members of our board of directors to enable our board to have the same measurement basis of cash generating capabilities as is used by management to compare our current cash generating capabilities with corresponding prior periods and with the results of other companies in our industry

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview executive overview we are an online postsecondary education services company 
our wholly owned subsidiaries and joint venture include the following capella university the university  a wholly owned subsidiary  is a regionally accredited university offering a variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs primarily for working adults 
resource development international limited rdi  a wholly owned subsidiary  is an independent provider of united kingdom uk university distance learning qualifications and markets  develops and delivers these programs worldwide via its offices and partners across asia  north america  africa and europe 
sophia learning  llc sophia  a joint venture in which we are the majority owner  is a social teaching and learning platform that integrates education with technology 
we believe we have the right operating strategies in place to continually differentiate ourselves in our markets and drive growth by supporting learner success  producing affordable degrees  expanding our brand  serving a broader set of our learner s professional needs and establishing new growth platforms 
technology and the talent of our faculty and employees enable these strategies 
we believe these strategies and enablers will allow us to continue to deliver high quality  affordable education  resulting in continued growth over the long term 
we will continue to invest in these enablers to strengthen the foundation and future of our business 
key trends  developments and challenges the following developments and trends present opportunities  challenges and risks toward achieving our goal of providing attractive returns to our shareholders introduction of new programs and specializations 
in  we introduced three new degree programs and fourteen new specializations  in  we launched eight new degree programs and fifteen new specializations 
we expect to continue to introduce additional degree programs and specializations across our markets in the future  as we believe this will further position capella for long term success 
certain types of new programs or specializations may require the department of education doe or department notification and or approval  which could have an impact on the anticipated timeframe to launch new offerings 
we invest in program and specialization development  as well as support infrastructure and marketing and selling  when introducing new programs and specializations 
in general  during the period of new program and specialization introduction  the associated revenues and operating income may grow at a slower rate than our established programs 
as our newer programs and specializations develop  we anticipate increases in enrollment  more cost effective delivery of instructional and support services and more efficient marketing and promotional processes 
establishing new growth platforms 
we seek to drive long term growth that is an extension of our core competencies into new markets 
we are pursuing this extension through a small business development team that is exploring early stage opportunities 
this may result in increased new business development costs focused on researching  identifying and cultivating these new opportunities 

table of contents rdi acquisition 
in july  we acquired rdi to access the fast growing international higher education market 
rdi has a significant presence in the uk and certain commonwealth countries 
although we believe the acquisition will have a positive impact on our revenue growth  there are certain factors that may result in lower revenue growth  including regulation changes in the uk higher education sector or changes in rdi s university partner relationships 
currently  rdi partners with several universities to validate degrees since rdi does not have its own taught degree awarding powers 
rdi was dilutive to our earnings in the fourth quarter of  which included effects of purchase accounting and amortization of intangibles 
we expect the financial results of rdi to be dilutive to our earnings in  in part related to amortization of intangibles and integration expenses 
competition for high quality inquiries 
as the industry has evolved to address regulatory concerns  competition for high quality inquiries has increased across all degree levels 
the increased competition has resulted in higher costs to acquire high quality inquiries  especially through aggregator channels 
we responded to the higher competition by reinforcing our commitment to quality inquiries within our targeted professional markets through a more strategic shift towards brand focused marketing 
the shift has also resulted in improved conversion rates of prospective learners 
with the changes we have made to date  a significantly lower percentage of inquiries is now generated from the aggregator channel and conversion rates have improved 
however  the number of inquiries previously generated in the aggregator channel has not yet been fully replaced but we are starting to see moderating costs per enrollment 
we believe building our brand awareness will produce long term efficiencies and increase our ability to attract high quality learners on a long term sustainable basis 
current market environment 
the market continues to present challenging conditions 
we survey prospective learners on a regular basis and continue to see hesitation to take on the financial responsibility of a university education in the current market environment 
although the decision cycle for prospective learners continues to be at historically long levels  we remain focused on attracting the right learners and learner success 
initiatives to improve learner success 
as we continue to position capella to drive sustainable growth  we are focused on improving learner success rates particularly in the first four quarters of enrollment  while maintaining a high standard of academic quality and rigor 
in order to further increase our focus on improving the learner experience and attracting learners who are more likely to persist in our programs  we recently implemented various measures likely to affect our growth and profitability  at least in the near term  including the following transitioning our marketing approaches to more effectively identify learners with the ability to succeed in our educational programs  including reduced emphasis on the utilization of third parties for inquiry generation and greater emphasis on reaching prospective learners earlier in their decision cycle  optimizing and refining our brand messaging to key professions and working to increase efficiencies across all of our marketing channels  investing in our actionable analytics capabilities even further to leverage data  refine our models and accurately predict the likelihood of a prospective and new learner persisting to critical thresholds of success in those first four quarters of enrollment by providing clear information near real time to our learners  faculty  advisors and staff to help learners persist and successfully complete their programs  and  diversifying outside of capella university by establishing access to new markets  creating innovative new learning technologies that have potential to increase affordability  and better serve the life long learning needs of working adult professionals 

table of contents we expect some of these initiatives may adversely impact our new and active enrollment and revenue in  and potentially beyond 
however  we believe these efforts are in the best interest of our learners and over the long term will improve learner success and lifetime revenue  which  in turn  will position us for more sustainable long term growth 
new enrollment growth 
we have historically experienced double digit new enrollment growth 
in  we experienced negative new enrollment growth and expect continued new enrollment pressure 
we expect negative new enrollment growth to adversely impact our active enrollments  revenues  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in the near term 
reduction of workforce 
in february  we implemented a strategic reduction of workforce by eliminating approximately positions and incurred charges of approximately million in the year ended december  in november  we announced an additional targeted reduction of workforce in line with our strategy 
we eliminated approximately positions and incurred charges of approximately million 
we expect to realize an annualized cost savings resulting from both reductions of workforce of approximately to million 
regulatory environment rulemaking by the us department of education 
in  the doe issued new title iv program integrity rules that address numerous topics 
the most significant to our business are the following adoption of a definition of gainful employment for purposes of the requirement for title iv student financial aid that a program of study offered by a proprietary institution prepare learners for gainful employment in a recognized occupation  implementation of standards for state authorization of institutions of higher education  and implementation of standards around the new program approval section of gainful employment 
the department published final regulations on october   including disclosure and reporting provisions related to gainful employment metrics 
most of the october  final rules were effective july  in addition to the final program integrity rules  current rulemaking by the doe has amended the return of funds regulations to require an institution to determine the amount of title iv program funds that a learner earned based on when the learner stopped participating in the course instead of when the learner withdrew from the course 
the amended regulation went into effect on july   and as anticipated  has adversely impacted our bad debt expense 
gainful employment 
under the higher education act  proprietary schools are eligible to participate in title iv programs under the condition that they provide educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation 
on october   and june   the department published final regulations on gainful employment 

table of contents disclosures 
effective july   proprietary institutions of higher education as well as public and not for profit institutions offering postsecondary non degree programs must provide prospective students with the types of employment associated with the program  total cost of the program  completion rate  job placement rate  if applicable  and median loan debt of program completers 
reporting 
effective october   institutions must annually submit information to the department about students who complete a program leading to gainful employment in a recognized occupation  including the amount of debt incurred under private loans or institutional finance plans  graduation information  and end of year enrollment information 
new program approval 
effective july   the final regulations require institutions to notify the department at least days before the start of new educational programs leading to gainful employment in recognized occupations 
this notification must include information on the need for the program  a wage analysis  an institutional program review and approval process  and a demonstration of accreditation 
an institution is not required to obtain formal department approval if the notification is submitted at least days prior to the first day of class 
however  if the department decides during the course of review that an approval is warranted  a notice will be sent to the institution at least days prior to the first day of class with a request for additional information 
the department issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on the subject of new program approval on september  significant proposed changes include institutions must notify the department of a new program only if the program is a a program substantially similar to a program that is failing to meet both gainful employment debt metrics  b a program that is outside the scope of the institution s accreditation  or c the secretary notifies the institution that it must apply for approval 
capella believes that the proposed rules would significantly reduce our reporting burden and are better aligned with the intent and scope of gainful employment 
debt to earnings ratio and loan repayment rate 
the metrics used to define gainful employment in the final rule are based on debt to earnings and loan repayment rates  but with changes from the proposed rule issued july summary of the final regulation 
a program leads to gainful employment in a recognized occupation if it meets one of the following metrics loan repayment rate at least percent of former students are repaying their loans 
the repayment rate generally is measured using the student s third and fourth year of repayment  with a few exceptions 
if there are or fewer borrowers in a two year period  the repayment rate period will be expanded to include borrowers in the third  fourth  fifth and sixth years 
if there are still fewer than borrowers after that point  the program is considered to have passed the metric 
debt to earnings ratio either a the estimated annual loan repayment of a typical graduate does not exceed percent of his or her discretionary income income above of the poverty level  or b the estimated annual loan payment of a typical graduate does not exceed percent of his or her total earnings 
the ratios generally will be based upon students in their third and fourth years after graduation  with the same exceptions pertaining to small cohort programs described immediately above  for the repayment rate metric 
debt will be calculated based upon the program s median debt  which will include private loans 
annual payments will be calculated based on a year standard repayment plan for certificate and associates degree programs  years for bachelor s and master s programs  and years for graduate and professional programs 
debt incurred for living expenses is excluded from the calculation 
if a program fails both the loan repayment and debt to earnings metrics after one failure  the institution must provide a warning to students disclosing the amount by which the program missed minimal acceptable performance and the program s plans for improvement and establish a three day waiting period before a student can enroll 

table of contents after two failures within three years  the institution must provide a warning to prospective and enrolled students in the failing program stating the plan it intends to take in response  the risks associated with enrolling or continuing in the program  that the student should expect to have difficulty repaying the loans  and if the school chooses to discontinue the program at this stage  the timeline for doing so 
after three failures within four years  the program loses eligibility for federal student aid 
institutions cannot then reestablish the program s eligibility for at least three years 
although the final rules regarding gainful employment metrics provide opportunities to address program deficiencies before the loss of title iv eligibility  the continuing eligibility of our educational programs for title iv funding is at risk due to factors beyond our control  such as changes in the actual or deemed income level of our graduates  changes in student borrowing levels  increases in interest rates  changes in the federal poverty income level relevant for calculating discretionary income  changes in the percentage of our former students who are current in repayment of their student loans  and other factors 
in addition  even though deficiencies in the metrics may be correctible on a timely basis  the disclosure requirements to students following a failure to meet the standards may adversely impact enrollment in that program and may adversely impact the reputation of our educational institution 
the exposure to these external factors may reduce our ability to confidently offer or continue certain types of programs for which there is market demand  thus impacting our ability to maintain or grow our business 
us congressional hearings 
the health  education  labor and pensions committee of the u 
s 
senate help committee has held a series of hearings  initially in june and most recently on june   focused on the proprietary education sector and student loan debt 
we believe that future hearings on the for profit sector may be held 
in addition  other congressional hearings have been or are expected to be held regarding various aspects of the education industry that may affect our business  including hearings before the house education and workforce committee and the senate homeland security and governmental affairs subcommittee on federal financial management  government information  federal services and international security 
we have been and intend to continue being responsive to the requests of the help committee 
any action by congress that significantly reduces title iv program funding or the eligibility of capella university or our learners to participate in title iv programs would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
recently enacted laws 
the budget control act of was signed into law on august  the law contains provisions that eliminate the subsidized stafford loan program for graduate learners effective july  in the subsidized stafford loan program  the federal government pays the interest that accrues while the learner is in school 
the learner is then responsible for the interest that accrues after they leave the institution 
graduate learners can still obtain federal financial aid through the unsubsidized stafford loan program 
in the unsubsidized stafford loan program  the learner can choose to either pay the interest that accrues while they are in school or defer payments on the interest until they leave the institution both accrue at 
graduate learners can still participate in the subsidized stafford loan program until july  the impact to capella will manifest in slightly larger debt loads and monthly debt payments for our exiting students 
title iv compliance audit of capella university 
we perform periodic reviews and self audits of our compliance with the various applicable regulatory requirements of the doe and state regulatory authorities 
we have not been notified by any of the various regulatory agencies of any significant noncompliance matters that would adversely impact our ability to participate in title iv programs  however  the office of inspector general oig of the doe has conducted a compliance audit of capella university 
the audit commenced on april  and we subsequently provided the oig with periodic information  responded to follow up inquiries and 
table of contents facilitated site visits and access to the company s records 
the oig completed its field work in january and the company received a draft audit report on august  capella university provided written comments on the draft audit report to the oig on september  on march   the oig s final report was issued to the acting chief operating officer coo for federal student aid fsa  which is responsible for primary oversight of the title iv funding programs 
we responded to the final report on april  in  we provided fsa staff with certain requested information for financial aid years through the fsa will subsequently issue final findings and requirements for capella university 
the fsa may take certain actions  including requiring that we refund certain federal student aid funds  requiring us to modify our title iv administration procedures  and or requiring us to pay fines or penalties 
based on the final audit report for the financial aid years through  the most significant potential financial exposure pertains to repayments to the doe that could be required if the fsa concludes that capella university did not properly calculate the amount of title iv funds required to be returned for learners that withdrew without providing an official notification of such withdrawal and without engaging in the courseroom prior to such withdrawal 
if the fsa determines that capella university improperly withheld any portion of these funds  capella university would be required to return the improperly withheld funds 
we and the oig have differing interpretations of the relevant regulations regarding what constitutes engagement in the unofficial withdrawal context 
as we interpret the engagement requirement  we currently estimate that for the three year audit period  and for the subsequent aid years through  the total amount of title iv funds not returned  for learners who withdrew without providing official notification and without engaging as required in the relevant regulations  was approximately million including interest  but not including fines and penalties 
if this difference of interpretation is ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to us  then the total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification would be greater than the amount we have currently estimated 
our key financial results metrics revenues 
revenues consist principally of tuition  application fees  and commissions we earn from bookstore and publication sales 
during each of   and tuition represented approximately   and of our revenues  respectively 
factors affecting our revenues include i the number of enrollments  ii the number of courses per learner  iii our degree and program mix  iv the number of programs and specializations we offer  v annual tuition adjustments  and vi the number of colloquia events and learners at each event 
enrollments for a particular time period are defined as the number of learners registered in a course on the last day of classes within that period 
we offer monthly start options for newly enrolled learners 
learners who start their program in the second or third month of a quarter transition to a quarterly schedule beginning in their second quarter 
enrollments are a function of the number of continuing learners at the beginning of each period and new enrollments during the period  which are offset by graduations  withdrawals and inactive learners during the period 
inactive learners for a particular period include learners who are not registered in a class and  therefore  are not generating revenues for that period  but who have not withdrawn from capella university 
we believe that our enrollments are influenced by the attractiveness of our program offerings and learning experience  the effectiveness of our marketing and recruiting efforts  the quality of our faculty  the number of programs and specializations we offer  the availability of federal and other funding  the length of our educational programs  the seasonality of our enrollments  general economic conditions  and the regulatory environment 

table of contents the following is a summary of our learners as of the last day of classes for the years ended december   and year ended december  doctoral master s bachelor s other total tuition and fees 
our tuition rates vary by type and length of program and by degree level  such as doctoral  master s or bachelor s 
for all learners in master s and bachelor s programs  tuition is charged on a per course basis 
prices per course ranged from  to  for the academic year beginning in july and from  to  for the academic year beginning in july 
the price of the course varies based upon the number of credit hours  the degree level of the program and the discipline 
the majority of doctoral programs are priced at a fixed quarterly amount ranging from  to  per learner for the academic year and from  to  per learner for the academic year  regardless of the number of courses in which the learner was registered 
for select doctoral programs  tuition is charged on a per course basis 
prices per course ranged from  to  for the academic year and from  to  for the academic year 
other in the enrollment table above refers primarily to certificate seeking learners 
certificate programs generally consist of four courses  and the price of a course depends on the number of credit hours and the discipline 
prices per course in certificate programs generally ranged from  to  for the academic year and from  to  for the academic year 
tuition increases have not historically been  and may not be in the future  consistent across our programs and specializations due to market conditions  program differentiation or changes in operating costs that have an impact on price adjustments of individual programs or specializations 
capella university implemented a weighted average tuition increase of for the academic year 
refer to the university s website  www 
capella 
edu schools programs degrees 
aspx  for tuition costs and credits required by individual degree 
these program costs will vary by learner based upon the program and specialization selected  the number of courses taken per quarter and the number of transfer credits earned at other institutions 
additionally  we offer scholarships and tuition discounts  under a variety of different programs  to members of the armed forces and in connection with our various corporate  healthcare  federal and educational marketing relationships 
a large portion of our learners rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  predominantly title iv programs  to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in the years ended december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues calculated on a cash basis were attributable to funds derived from title iv programs 
in addition to title iv funding  our learners receive financial aid from other governmental sources  tuition reimbursement from their employers or the department of defense or finance their education with their own funds or through private financing institutions 
costs and expenses 
we categorize our costs and expenses as i instructional costs and services expenses  ii marketing and promotional expenses and iii general and administrative expenses 

table of contents instructional costs and services expenses are items of expense directly attributable to the educational services we provide our learners 
this expense category includes costs associated with core faculty  part time faculty  administrators  academic advisors  academic records  financial aid and other university services 
also included are expenses related to an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  share based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to providing educational services to our learners 
instructional pay for part time faculty varies across programs and is primarily dependent on the number of learners taught 
marketing and promotional expenses include salaries and benefits of personnel engaged in recruitment and promotion  as well as costs associated with advertising and the production of marketing materials related to new enrollments and current learners 
our marketing and promotional expenses are generally affected by the cost of advertising media  the efficiency of our marketing efforts  salaries and benefits for our sales personnel  brand spending  and the number of advertising initiatives for new and existing academic programs 
marketing and promotional expenses also include an allocation of facility  admissions and human resources costs  share based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs that are attributable to marketing and promotional efforts 
general and administrative expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in corporate management  new business development  finance  compliance and other corporate functions  together with an allocation of facility and human resources costs  share based compensation expense  depreciation and amortization and information technology costs attributable to such functions 
general and administrative expenses also include bad debt expense and any charges associated with asset impairments 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 
net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest consists of sophia s minority owner s portion of sophia s losses 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  contingencies  share based compensation expense  other than temporary impairments  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes and noncontrolling interest 
the results of our analysis form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and the impact of such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
tuition revenue represented approximately   and of our revenues recognized for each of the years ended december    and  respectively 
course tuition revenue is deferred and recognized as revenue ratably over the period of instruction  which is generally from one and a half to three months 
if a learner withdraws or drops a course  we follow the university refund policy  which generally is percent refund through five days  percent refund from six to twelve days  and zero percent 
table of contents refund for the remainder of the period 
the refund policy varies slightly for learners within certain states due to state rules or regulations 
we do not recognize revenue for learners who enroll but never engage in the courseroom 
refunds are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period that the learner withdraws from a course 
if a partial refund is given to a learner in accordance with the university refund policy  the portion of the revenue which has been earned by us is recognized over the remaining period of instruction 
colloquia tuition revenue is recognized over the length of the colloquia  which ranges from three days to two weeks 
deferred revenue in any period represents the excess of tuition and fees received as compared to tuition and fees recognized in revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and is reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our learners to make required payments 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts amount based on an analysis of the accounts receivable detail and historical write off experience  and current economic conditions  recoveries and trends 
in establishing our credit practices  we seek to strike an appropriate balance between prudent learner credit policies and learner retention 
accordingly  we periodically review and alter learner credit policies to achieve that objective by restricting or expanding the availability of credit we extend 
changes to credit practices may impact enrollments  revenues  accounts receivables  our allowance for doubtful accounts and bad debt expense 
if changes in credit practices result in higher receivable balances  if the financial condition of our learners deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  or if we underestimate the allowances required  additions to our allowance for doubtful accounts may be necessary  which will result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination is made 
as of december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million and million  respectively 
during   and  we recognized bad debt expense of million  million  and million  respectively 
contingencies 
we accrue for costs associated with contingencies including  but not limited to  regulatory compliance and legal matters when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
we base these accruals on management s estimate of such costs  which may vary from the ultimate cost and expenses associated with any such contingency 
share based compensation 
we measure and recognize compensation expense for share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values of the share award on the date of grant 
the fair value of our service based stock options was estimated as of the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions year ended december  expected life in years expected volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield weighted average fair value of options granted the expected life of our options granted during the years ended december    and is based upon our historical stock option activity 
the expected volatility assumption for the years ended december    and is based upon our own historical stock price and the expected life of the options 

table of contents the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of regular dividend payments 
we have not historically and currently do not pay dividends 
in determining share based compensation expense  significant management judgment and assumptions are required concerning such factors as expected term  expected volatility and forfeitures 
in our opinion  the assumptions that have the most significant affect on the fair value of our service based stock options and  therefore  share based compensation expense  are the expected life and expected volatility 
the following table illustrates how changes to the black scholes option pricing model assumptions would affect the weighted average fair values as of the grant date for grants made during fiscal year expected volatility expected life years as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
marketable securities other than temporary impairments 
available for sale marketable securities are carried at fair value as determined by quoted market prices or other observable inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace for identical or similar assets  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
management reviews the fair value of the portfolio at least monthly  and evaluates individual securities with fair values below amortized cost at the balance sheet date 
in order to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  management must conclude whether they intend to sell the impaired security and whether it is more likely than not that they will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
if management intends to sell an impaired debt security or it is more likely than not they will be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  an other than temporary impairment is deemed to have occurred 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment related to a credit loss or impairments on securities management has the intent to sell before recovery are recognized in earnings 
the amount of the other than temporary impairment on debt securities related to other factors is recorded consistent with changes in the fair value of all other available for sale securities as a component of shareholders equity in other comprehensive income or loss 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value assigned to the underlying assets acquired and assumed liabilities 
at the time of an acquisition  we allocate the goodwill and related assets and liabilities to its respective reporting unit 
management identifies its reporting unit by assessing whether the components of its operating segment constitutes businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
we will assess goodwill annually in the fourth quarter for impairment or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the respective reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a two step test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of its net assets 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is

if the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
we did not record any impairment charges for the year ended december  finite lived intangible assets that are acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair market value on their acquisition date and are amortized on a straight line basis to reflect the economic useful life of the asset 
we do not currently have any infinite lived intangible assets 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method and compute the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the related financial amounts 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred tax liabilities 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets or other elements of the tax provision 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgments that could become subject to examination by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the impact on our deferred taxes and income tax liabilities and the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes in income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels  among other things  could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
we are subject to us federal income tax and multiple state jurisdictions  as well as united kingdom corporation tax and hong kong profits tax 
currently  the state of new york has initiated an income tax audit for the years during  we completed income tax audits for tax years with the state of minnesota and the state of oregon  and tax years with the state of illinois 
for us federal and united kingdom corporation tax purposes  the statute of limitations remains open on tax years from for hong kong  the statute of limitations is years and for state purposes  the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction  but is generally from to years 
for hong kong and those states that generated net operating losses in earlier years  the statute of limitations begins to run in the year subsequent to the utilization of net operating losses 
we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits 
of this total  million net of the federal benefit on state issues  represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods 
we continue to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
we recognized thousand  million  and million in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense during the years ended december    and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
in october   the statute of limitations expired on state issues related to tax year with no material impact expected on the unrecognized tax benefits 
in september and october  the statute of limitations will expire on approximately million in unrecognized tax benefits related federal and state issues in tax year noncontrolling interest 
the equity interests in sophia not owned by the company are reported as redeemable noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet 
losses incurred by sophia were charged to the company and to the noncontrolling interest holder based on ownership percentage 

table of contents there is a put option within the sophia learning  llc agreement which permits the noncontrolling interest holder to put its shares to the company within a specified time period 
since these shares are outside of our control  the noncontrolling interest is considered contingently redeemable and thus is presented in mezzanine equity in our consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to authoritative guidance  if the value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest is less than fair market value  and it is probable that the contingency related to the put option will be met  then the carrying value of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest must be adjusted to fair market value through a charge directly to retained earnings 
as we have determined that it is probable that the put option will be exercised based upon the passage of time  we performed a valuation of the contingently redeemable noncontrolling interest to determine fair market value 
as a result of this valuation  management determined that a charge of approximately million to retained earnings was needed at december  results of operations the following selected financial data table should be referenced in connection with a review of the discussion of our results of operations for year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  in thousands change change of revenue vs

table of contents revenues 
the increase in revenues in compared to was primarily driven by percentage points from increased enrollments and percentage points from tuition increases  partially offset by percentage points due to a larger proportion of master s and bachelor s learners  who generated less revenue per learner than our doctoral learners 
end of period enrollment increased percent in compared to tuition increases in generally ranged from zero to seven percent and were implemented during july instructional costs and services expenses 
instructional costs and services expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to our ongoing investment in faculty and learner support as a result of increased enrollments and the need to support those enrollments 
there was also an increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of increased capital investments in and related to the learner experience and academic quality 
instructional costs and services expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to scale of fixed costs and productivity gains across our faculty  academic administration  and learner support functions  lower facilities expenses as a result of scaling our fixed costs and the consolidation of all of our employees to one location in  and lower colloquia costs as a result of colloquia revenue growth slower than total revenue growth 
this decrease was partially offset by increased faculty expenses related to our adjunct faculty moving from independent contractor to employee status 
marketing and promotional expenses 
marketing and promotional expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to an increase in core marketing efforts and brand advertising focused on improving conversion rates and new enrollment growth and an increase in the cost per inquiry 
marketing and promotional expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased compared to prior year primarily as a result of fixed cost leverage from strong revenue growth as well as favorable conversion rates 
also contributing to the improvement were productivity gains in enrollment operations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased compared to prior year primarily due to increased spending on strategic business development  investments in portfolio strategy  and an increase in bonus expense 
in addition  expenses were paid related to a settlement of the patent infringement litigation initiated by digital vending services international inc  which was offset by a recognized gain from an unrelated settlement from one of our insurance carriers for recovery of expenses in prior periods 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased slightly compared to the prior year primarily due to increased spending on strategic business development and investments in portfolio strategy 
these increases were offset by a decrease in one time compensation expenses  which resulted from severance recorded in the prior year and executive chairman fees paid in to our founding chief executive officer as part of his retirement transition

learner population varies as a result of new enrollments  graduations and learner attrition 
the sequential quarterly increase in enrollments has typically been the greatest in the fourth quarter of each respective year  which corresponds with a traditional fall school start 
the larger relative increases in enrollments in the fourth quarter have resulted in larger sequential increases in revenue during the fourth quarter than in other quarters 
a significant portion of our general and administrative expenses does not vary proportionately with fluctuations in revenues  resulting in larger relative increases in operating income in the fourth quarter relative to increases between other quarters 
in addition  we typically implement tuition increases at the beginning of an academic year  which coincides with the start of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of these seasonal patterns 
in addition to our recurring seasonal patterns described above  our quarterly revenue is impacted by the timing of our colloquia tuition revenue  as evidenced in the fourth quarter of both and we typically have fourteen to sixteen colloquia per year 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we financed our operating activities and capital expenditures during the years ended december    and primarily through cash provided by operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million and million at december  and respectively 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased primarily due to an increase in share repurchase activity during 
table of contents on september   we entered into an unsecured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na  and certain other lenders 
the credit agreement provides million of borrowing capacity  with an increase option of an additional million 
the credit agreement has a term of five years ending september  as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility and we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
our previous million line of credit facility with wells fargo bank  set to expire july   was terminated upon entering into the credit agreement 
on july   the department of education approved the cancellation and release of the million letter of credit issued under the previous letter of credit 
significant portions of our revenues are derived from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements under title iv programs 
learners must apply for new loans and grants each academic year  which begins july loan funds are provided through the william d 
ford direct loan program in multiple disbursements for each academic year 
the disbursements are usually received by the beginning of the third week of the term 
these factors  together with the timing of when our learners begin their programs  affect our operating cash flow 
based on current market conditions and recent regulatory or legislative actions  we do not anticipate any significant near term disruptions in the availability of title iv funding for our learners 
on july   the company acquired of the share capital of rdi for million approximately million  net of cash acquired 
in connection with the agreement  we will make an additional payment of million approximately million if rdi is granted taught degree awarding power tdap 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe our cash provided by operations and other sources of liquidity  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will provide adequate funds for ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
we can further supplement our liquidity position with the million credit facility entered into on september  to fund our operations or to fund strategic investments  if needed 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net income  an increase in accounts receivable due to a change in the return to title iv participation requirements  and a decrease in cash from accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to a decrease in accrued bonus expense  and the timing of payroll and vendor invoices 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of greater capital expenditures in and  and a decrease in excess tax benefits from share based compensation as a result of fewer exercises of share based compensation and higher stock prices in compared to net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of million and a million increase in depreciation and amortization as a result of greater capital expenditures in and the increase was partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balance primarily driven by higher revenue partially offset by lower days sales outstanding and changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of vendor invoices and payroll 
investing activities cash provided by or used in investing activities is primarily related to capital expenditures  the sale or maturities of marketable securities  and net cash payment for the acquisition of rdi 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   and net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  
table of contents cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of net maturities of tax exempt municipal securities  which was partially offset by cash used for capital expenditures and the net cash payment for the acquisition of rdi 
net maturities of marketable securities were million during the year ended december  net purchases of these securities were million during the year ended december  the maturities of marketable securities in were held as cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe the credit quality and liquidity of our investment portfolio as of december  is strong 
the unrealized gains and losses of the portfolio may remain volatile as changes in the general interest rate environment and supply demand fluctuations of the securities within our portfolio impact daily market valuations 
to mitigate the risk associated with this market volatility  we deploy a relatively conservative investment strategy focused on capital preservation and liquidity 
however  even with this approach  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further due to unpredictable market developments 
in addition  these unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain of the assets in our investment portfolio 
capital expenditures were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
capital expenditures in primarily consist of investments in a data center  data analytics  and other investments related to improving the learner experience and academic quality 
we expect that our capital expenditures in will be approximately six to seven percent of revenues and we expect to be able to fund these capital expenditures with cash generated from operations 
during the year ended december   we used million in cash as payment for the acquisition of rdi  net of cash acquired 
we currently lease all of our facilities and expect to make future payments on existing leases from cash generated from operations 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million  million  and million for the year ended december    and  respectively 
in  we repurchased million of common stock under our repurchase program  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
repurchases of common stock increased million in over  and million in over contractual obligations the following table sets forth  as of december   the aggregate amounts of our significant contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms due in each of the periods presented payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases a other obligations b total contractual obligations a minimum lease commitments for our headquarters  rdi s office space  miscellaneous office equipment and software license agreements 
b other obligations include commitments for marketing related contracts 

table of contents due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future borrowings associated with our credit facility  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of any commitment fees charged on the unused portion of the credit facility 
therefore  the maximum estimated commitment fee of million per annum is excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
as the timing of when rdi may be awarded taught degree awarding powers tdap is uncertain  the contingent consideration of million is excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
the million represents the fair value of the contingent consideration and is included in other liabilities as of december  during the period beginning april  and ending october   the noncontrolling interest holder may require us to purchase all  and not less than all  of its ownership interest for an amount equal to the then fair market value 
such fair market value cannot be determined at this point  and therefore is excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
as of december   the fair market value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was approximately million 
regulation and oversight we are subject to extensive regulation by federal and state governmental agencies and accrediting bodies 
in particular  the higher education act hea and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the doe subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny on the basis of numerous standards that schools must satisfy to participate in title iv programs 
title iv compliance audit of capella university 
we perform periodic reviews and self audits of our compliance with the various applicable regulatory requirements of the doe and state regulatory authorities 
we have not been notified by any of the various regulatory agencies of any significant noncompliance matters that would adversely impact our ability to participate in title iv programs  however  the oig of the doe has conducted a compliance audit of capella university 
the audit commenced on april  and we subsequently provided the oig with periodic information  responded to follow up inquiries and facilitated site visits and access to the company s records 
the oig completed its field work in january and the company received a draft audit report on august  capella university provided written comments on the draft audit report to the oig on september  on march   the oig s final report was issued to the acting chief operating officer coo for federal student aid fsa  which is responsible for primary oversight of the title iv funding programs 
we responded to the final report on april  in  we provided fsa staff with certain requested information for financial aid years through the fsa will subsequently issue final findings and requirements for capella university 
the fsa may take certain actions  including requiring that we refund certain federal student aid funds  requiring us to modify our title iv administration procedures  and or requiring us to pay fines or penalties 
based on the final audit report for the financial aid years through  the most significant potential financial exposure pertains to repayments to the doe that could be required if the fsa concludes that capella university did not properly calculate the amount of title iv funds required to be returned for learners that withdrew without providing an official notification of such withdrawal and without engaging in the courseroom prior to such withdrawal 
if the fsa determines that capella university improperly withheld any portion of these funds  capella university would be required to return the improperly withheld funds 
we and the oig have differing interpretations of the relevant regulations regarding what constitutes engagement in the unofficial withdrawal context 
as we interpret the engagement requirement  we currently estimate that for the three year audit period  and for the subsequent aid years through  the total amount of title iv funds not returned  for learners who withdrew without providing official notification and without engaging as required 
table of contents in the relevant regulations  was approximately million including interest  but not including fines and penalties 
if this difference of interpretation is ultimately resolved in a manner adverse to us  then the total amount of title iv funds not returned for learners who withdrew without providing official notification would be greater than the amount we have currently estimated 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    or there can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition

the guidance will be effective for the company s interim and annual reporting periods beginning january   and applied prospectively 
the company does not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations  or disclosures 
we have reviewed and considered all recent accounting pronouncements and believe there are none that could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
we believe the risk related to cash equivalents and marketable securities is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy  which focuses on capital preservation and liquidity 
in addition  all investments must have a minimum 
table of contents standard poor s rating of a minus or equivalent by at least one agency at the purchase date 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  and december  were rated a minus or higher 
in addition  we utilize money managers who conduct initial and ongoing credit analysis on our investment portfolio to monitor and minimize the potential impact of market risk associated with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
despite the investment risk mitigation strategies we employ  we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and we may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline further in this time of economic uncertainty 
unusual and unpredictable market developments may also create liquidity challenges for certain assets in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we manage interest rate risk by investing excess funds in cash equivalents and marketable securities bearing a combination of fixed and variable interest rates  which are tied to various market indices 
our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
at december   a increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair values  or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange risk we use the us dollar as our reporting currency 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the local currencies 
accordingly  our foreign currency exchange risk is related to the following exposures adjustments resulting from the translation of assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using exchange rates in the effect at the balance sheet dates 
these translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  earnings volatility translation of income and expense items of the foreign subsidiaries using an average monthly exchange rate for the respective periods  and  gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange rate changes related to intercompany receivables and payables that are not of a long term investment nature  as well as gains and losses from foreign currency transactions 
these items are recorded in other income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
in fiscal year  we recorded thousand in net foreign currency translation gains  net of tax  that are included in other comprehensive income 
these gains are primarily the result of the general weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies during fiscal year we have not used derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
