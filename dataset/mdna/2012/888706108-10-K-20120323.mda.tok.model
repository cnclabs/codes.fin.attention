item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and part i  item a  risk factors for a more detailed description of these significant risks and uncertainties 
part i 
item business the company tivo is a leading developer and provider of software and technology that enables the search  navigation  and access of content across disparate sources  including linear television  on demand television  and broadband video in a single  easy  intuitive user experience 
we provide these capabilities through set top boxes that include digital video recorders dvrs or non dvr set top boxes  tablet computers  mobile phones  and other screens 
we also provide innovative advertising solutions for the media industry  including a unique platform for interactive advertising and audience measurement services 
since prior to the introduction of our first commercial dvr in  we have developed significant intellectual property applicable to the advanced television market and we are focused on protecting our intellectual property 
historically  we have distributed the majority of our products and services directly to consumers and have also developed indirect channels of distribution through large domestic and international television service providers who utilize our software and technology in set top boxes and other devices that receive their multichannel services 
these customers include charter communications  directv  grande  rcn  suddenlink  and others in the united states  ono spain  virgin media united kingdom and others outside the united states 
we primarily generate revenues from four sources consumer service 
our primary source of revenues is from consumers in our direct to consumer business  who subscribe to the tivo service directly with us and typically pay us monthly fees  or in some cases pay for tivo service for the life of their product upfront  which we report as our tivo owned service subscriptions 
we sell our dvrs to consumers through distribution relationships with major retailers  such as best buy  and direct through our on line store at tivo 
com 
television service providers or msos 
we work with television service providers  which we also refer to as msos  who typically pay us recurring monthly fees in order to provide the tivo service to their subscribers either as their default user interface or as an optional premium service 
we may also receive revenues for licensing and professional services and hardware sales from these customers 
media services 
we work directly with television advertisers  agencies  and networks to offer a variety of solutions for the television advertising and research market 
these include short and long form interactive video advertising  lead generation  and commerce as well as unique second by second audience research measurement 
licensing revenues 
in connection with settlements of litigation  tivo has entered into agreements with dish network and at t inc in which we provide rights to use certain tivo patents 
we continue to be subject to a number of risks  including intellectual property claims by and against us and the related costs of such intellectual property litigation  continued need for significant research and development and the related costs of such research and development activities  delays in product and service developments  competitive service offerings  lack of market acceptance  ongoing losses and uncertainty of future profitability  dependence on third parties for manufacturing  marketing  and sales support  as well as third party rollout schedules  software development issues for third party products which contain our technology  access to television programming including digital cable signals in connection with cablecard tm and switched digital technologies  dependence on our relationships with third party service providers for our mso subscription growth  and our ability to maintain our tivo owned subscription base and consumer service business 
we conduct our operations through one reportable segment 
in our fiscal year ended january   we had net income of million and cash provided by operating activities was million  which was primarily driven by litigation settlements with dish network and at t inc as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have had a history of losses and expect this trend to continue in our fiscal year ending january  we anticipate that our tivo owned business will continue to be seasonal and expect to generate a significant number of our new tivo owned subscriptions during and immediately after the holiday shopping season 
we are cautious about our ability to maintain our current number of tivo owned subscriptions in our fiscal year ending january  while we anticipate growth in our mso subscription base from our deployments with television service providers  we may not immediately achieve a corresponding increase in service revenues and margin expansion from the fees these subscriptions generate since these fees will be first classified as technology revenues until we recoup our initial development expenditures under our current zero margin or completed contract arrangements  including with directv  ono  and virgin 
see the discussions under the heading risk factors risks related to our business if we fail to properly estimate  manage  and perform the development and engineering services for our television service provider customers  we could incur additional unexpected expenses and losses which could reduce or even eliminate any profit from these deployment arrangements  in which case our business would be harmed 
our industry widespread adoption of advanced television services 
tivo revolutionized television viewing when it introduced the dvr over ten years ago  allowing consumers to enjoy an on demand experience 
since then  dvr adoption has grown rapidly and consumers have come to expect a great deal of flexibility and convenience in their consumption of entertainment 
our dvr products proved that the television entertainment experience could be significantly improved by removing the limitations of linear  appointment based viewing 
the emergence of video on demand and broadband video is once again revolutionizing the way people consume video entertainment 
the rapid growth of broadband video means a virtually infinite world of content choices now exists along with much greater convenience in how and when that content is viewed 
the rapid proliferation of content requires a solution to effectively suggest  search  navigate  and access the growing volume of broadcast  cable  and broadband video content choices including television shows  movies  user generated videos  music  and other personal content including photos and home videos whether that content was recorded via a dvr or delivered via broadband 
in addition  proliferation of new consumption devices like tablets and entertainment oriented smartphones creates additional demand for solutions that enable viewing when and where convenient for the user across multiple screens 
advanced television technology as a competitive asset 
nearly all of the major television service providers in the united states including comcast  directv  dish formerly echostar  time warner cable  and others  are offering dvr technology to their customers 
in addition  some are developing strategies to address albeit in very diverse ways the proliferation of broadband video and alternate devices 
some of these companies have indicated they consider such services a competitive tool to help differentiate their pay television services by offering their customers more programming features 
we believe that the combination of our award winning  easy to use interface and famous brand  hosted services  and customized advanced television solutions will drive higher consumer satisfaction and revenue for those operators who deploy our product offerings enabling them to more effectively attract and retain consumers to their own offerings 
the changing television advertising audience measurement industry 
the decline of linear television viewing  which is now only approximately of viewing on the tivo premiere platform  along with the proliferation of additional content choices is requiring television advertisers to evaluate new and different ways to reach consumers and measure their interactions with content and advertising 
the dvr and other new consumer electronic devices which access broadband video have given viewers the freedom to view content when they want  and this time shifting has made it more difficult for advertisers to be assured that their commercials will be viewed by audiences at the regularly scheduled time the program is aired by network or local television stations 
dvrs  in particular  allow viewers the freedom to fast forward through all or a portion of commercial advertising incorporated into television and other programs  which means that advertisers are not assured that their commercials will be viewed at all 
tivo offers other programming options  such as video delivered by broadband to the television  which may result in further audience fragmentation 
in addition  subject to its privacy policy and applicable laws  tivo collects data that allows it to anonymously except in cases where end users have specifically opted in to be identified such as the participants in our consumer panels measure the viewing of television programs and commercials in a manner that tivo believes is significantly more accurate and insightful than the traditional approach to television measurement practiced by companies like nielsen media 
this traditional approach is gradually being replaced by alternate forms of measurement which tivo is uniquely positioned to provide 
tivo uses second by second viewing data from a large national sample of our set top boxes to create highly detailed statistics which are not subject to the limitations of nielsen s minute by minute approach and program based ratings and should therefore become more and more valuable to television advertisers and programmers 
our strategy we believe we have created a unique set of technologies  products  and services that meet the needs of consumers  television service providers  and the advertising community 
our goal is to change the way consumers access and watch linear television  on demand television  and broadband video by offering a best in class user experience and to generate revenue through the licensing of our branded services and technology to television viewing households worldwide 
provide compelling  easy to use consumer offering 
our advanced television solutions have an easy  intuitive user interface and many features that we believe dramatically improve a consumer s television viewing experience 
our advanced television solutions can support linear television delivered through analog cable  digital cable  satellite  or over the air  television service provider video on demand  and broadband video 
our technology enables consumers to find and watch their favorite content by helping them discover new programming through features that search and browse for content by subject  title  genre  actor  director  or channel  enjoy access to extra content via broadband and comprehensive episode guides  as well as suggesting programs that consumers may like through a variety of tivo recommendation features 
offer increasingly differentiated features and services 
our goal is to lead the market with innovations that expand the value and potential of our advanced television services 
we plan to continue to invest significant resources in innovation to improve consumer choice  convenience  and control over their home entertainment and to make our services more compelling for both current and potential customers 
for example  we have launched tivo applications for android enabled smart phones and tablets and ios enabled smartphones and tablets 
these applications give consumers a much richer and more powerful way to explore all of the content available to them and expand the population of devices upon which we can deploy our services 
we expect that a significant portion of our future product development efforts will be focused on broadband functionality  support for additional secondary devices that will enable the tivo experience on additional consumer screens  and integration of new discovery paradigms like social network recommendations 
develop solutions for television service providers 
part of our strategy focuses on developing versions of the tivo service that can be deployed by third parties typically television service providers in conjunction with both tivo and third party designed set top boxes in order to promote the mass deployment of devices utilizing our technology 
for example  we are able to deliver a set top box product to our television service provider customers that combines within one integrated user interface on demand viewing of linear broadcast television delivered by the television service provider through a built in dvr  access to on demand viewing of a television service provider s own vod service  and access to broadband delivered content or so called over the top content 
additionally  we believe our retail business uniquely positions us versus other vendors to license our technology to television service providers as we understand consumer behavior first hand 
it allows us to leverage our research and development across our direct to consumer products as well as our products and services provided to television service providers 
there are two primary ways in which we license our tivo technology  a tivo box provisioned as a set top box where we are the hardware and software provider  and tivo software we build into third party hardware 
we have announced partnerships with operators to deploy our products in both these manners 
we have extensive knowledge of the inner workings of the television service providers infrastructures and believe we are able to integrate with their infrastructures in a cost and time effective manner 
extend tivo products beyond the us market 
we also believe there is a large opportunity to deploy the tivo service and technology outside the united states 
for example  we launched an exclusive distribution agreement in the united kingdom with virgin media  the united kingdom s largest cable operator  to provide the tivo service on next generation set top boxes  including both dvr and non dvr platforms 
we also have distribution arrangements that cover the geographies of australia  mexico  new zealand  spain  and taiwan 
our solutions have the ability to integrate broadband offerings for cable  satellite  and over the air television service providers and our strategy is to sign additional international partnerships and distribution agreements in the future 
typically  the parties distributing the tivo service under these agreements are subject to significant deployment and marketing commitments 
extend and protect our intellectual property 
the convenience  control  and ease of use of the tivo service is derived largely from the technology we have developed since prior to the introduction of our first commercial dvr in we have adopted a proactive patent and trademark strategy designed to protect and extend our technology and intellectual property 
we have filed patent applications relating to numerous inventions resulting from tivo research and development  including many critical aspects of the design  functionality  and operation of tivo products and services as well as technology that we may incorporate in future products and services 
tivo is prosecuting an intellectual property lawsuit against verizon including for willful infringement of the time warp patent 
during the fiscal year ended january   tivo entered into separate settlements of pending intellectual property lawsuits against dish network and at t inc for million and million  respectively 
tivo is also defending counterclaims from verizon and a lawsuit from motorola  in addition to other intellectual property litigation 
see the discussions in item a 
risk factors  relating to pending intellectual property litigation  and item legal proceedings 
generate revenue from advertising and audience research capabilities 
we offer interactive advertising capabilities to advertisers  advertising agencies  and broadcast networks 
our advertising products include detailed anonymous aggregated reporting on actual viewing and screen by screen interaction by consumers 
we offer our advertisers compelling interactive products such as branded showcases including long form video  requests for information  and customizable applications 
we also offer the ability to enhance existing television commercials with interactive tags  enabling consumers to pause television and explore additional advertising content 
we plan to continue to develop and enhance our interactive advertising and audience research measurement capabilities in the future to generate additional revenues as well as provide us with additional information to help us improve and enhance the tivo service for our customers 
our technology tivo has developed a technology portfolio that makes the tivo service available on a standalone retail dvr product line that is capable of receiving over the air digital signals  analog cable  digital cable through the use of cablecards tm  and from broadband video sources 
we have also entered into agreements with cable operators in the us such as comcast to enable our retail dvr products in the future to access operator provided video on demand services in addition to broadband video services 
the tivo service can also be deployed directly by us satellite and cable operators such as charter  directv  grande  rcn  suddenlink and internationally  such as with virgin media and ono 
our strategy is to sign additional distribution agreements in the future to make the tivo service available on additional set top boxes and other devices 
we believe that our research and development activity will continue to be a major priority that allows us to continue to innovate new products for our customers 
tivo s technology for enabling the tivo service includes the tivo service client software platform  the tivo service infrastructure  and tivo enabled hardware designs 
tivo service client software 
the tivo service client software functions on set top boxes and mobile devices which run the tivo software 
we have enhanced the client software to support multiple services and applications  such as receipt of broadband video content  digital music  and photos 
the tivo client software manages interaction with the tivo service infrastructure 
after the initial set up of the tivo service  the tivo enabled set top box will automatically connect to the tivo service infrastructure over a dial up or broadband connection to download the program guide data  client software upgrades  advertising content  and other broadband content 
we have also enabled the tivo service client software to operate on certain commonly used integrated dvr set top boxes  such as on a cisco and samsung manufactured set top box in connection with our virgin deployment arrangement 
tivo service infrastructure 
the tivo service infrastructure operates the tivo service  managing the distribution of proprietary services  and specialized content such as program guide data  interactive advertising  and tivo client software upgrades 
it interfaces with our billing and customer support systems for service authorization and bug tracking  among other activities 
in addition  the tivo service infrastructure collects anonymous viewing information uploaded from tivo enabled set top boxes for use in our audience research measurement efforts 
the infrastructure has also been designed to work with the networks of service provider customers 
tivo enabled hardware design 
the tivo enabled hardware designs are specifications developed by tivo for set top boxes containing a cpu  memory  digital video chips  and other components such as a hard disk drive in the case of our dvr products 
we provide this design to our contract manufacturer that produces tivo branded hardware 
the tivo enabled dvr hardware design includes a modular front end that allows the basic platform to be used for digital and analog broadcast  digital and analog cable  and satellite applications 
in addition  certain designs include usb ports to allow connection to broadband networks and external devices to enable existing and future services 
a tivo enabled dvr without a subscription to the tivo service has minimal functionality 
significant relationships directv 
directv is the largest provider of satellite television in the us we have had a longstanding relationship with directv from to the present to provide the tivo service to its customer base 
as of january   directv was our second largest mso subscription partner and represented a significant portion of our million mso subscription base 
directv currently pays us a recurring monthly per household fee for access to the technology needed to provide its customers the tivo service subject to an aggregate minimum monthly amount 
due to the declining number of directv mso subscriptions in recent years  in fiscal year  we recognized the monthly minimum amount each month during the entire year 
we incur limited recurring expenses 
we also recognize revenue from directv for engineering services work on integrated directv satellite receivers with tivo service and the related service infrastructure 
directv also distributes tivo advertising features on directv receivers with tivo service 
subject to certain restrictions and exceptions  both directv and tivo may sell this advertising and collect audience research measurement data  with each party retaining all their respective revenues generated from such sales 
on september   we extended our current agreement with directv for the development  marketing  and distribution of a new hd directv dvr featuring the tivo service 
under this new agreement  directv will pay a substantially higher monthly fee for households using the new hd directv dvrs with tivo  which are being deployed by directv  than the fees for previously deployed directv dvrs with tivo service 
directv will continue to pay the previous monthly fee for all households using only the previously deployed directv dvrs with tivo service 
the fees paid by directv are subject to monthly minimum payments that escalate during the term of the agreement which expires on february   unless extended until february  by directv 
we will continue to defer a portion of these fees as a non refundable credit to fund mutually agreed development  with excess development work to be funded by directv 
directv also has certain additional annual obligations to market and promote the new hd directv dvr featuring the tivo service now that it has launched 
best buy 
best buy is one of the largest nationwide retailers of consumer electronics in the united states and our largest retail customer 
we have had a long standing relationship with best buy since to sell our tivo dvrs to consumers 
on july   we entered into the master marketing and development agreement the marketing agreement  and as later amended  with best buy stores  lp  which amends and supplements our existing vendor agreement  as amended  dated as of march   with best buy purchasing  llc  under which we developed and deployed a broadband connected tv with a tivo user interface and continue our long standing retail marketing and dvr sales relationship 
customer service and support for our tivo owned standalone dvrs  we provide customer support through outsourced service providers as well as our internal customer service personnel 
in most cases  when our product is sold through a television service provider such as charter  directv  grande  ono  rcn  suddenlink  and virgin for example the service provider is primarily responsible for customer support 
we may provide training and other assistance to these service providers 
individual customers have access to an internet based repository for technical information and troubleshooting techniques 
they also can obtain support through other means such as the tivo website  web forums  email  and telephone support 
we offer a manufacturer s warranty of days for labor and one year for parts on the dvrs tivo manufacturers which enable our tivo owned subscriptions 
we contract with third parties to handle warranty repair 
warranties provided to service providers who distribute tivo hardware vary in length depending on the pricing paid by the buyer 
research and product development our research and development efforts are focused on designing and developing the components necessary to enable the tivo service 
these activities include hardware and software development 
fiscal year ended january  in millions research and development expenses we increased the number of our regular  temporary  and part time employees engaged in research and development by from a total of as of january  to as of january  however  during fiscal year we worked to ramp up our r d headcount resources to accommodate our development work and grew our research and development headcount by from to with the majority of the hiring during the last four months of the year 
thus  in fiscal year ended january   while we only moderately increased our staffing levels over the prior year  we experienced significantly higher levels of spend related to r d headcount resources because we maintain the higher staffing levels we achieved at the end of january  for the entire fiscal year ended january  in the fiscal year ending january   we currently expect our research and development expense to be consistent with fiscal year in the aggregate  however  we do expect our research and development expenditures to begin to decrease in the second half of fiscal year as compared to the same prior year periods 
manufacturing and supply chain we outsource the manufacturing of our products to third party manufacturers 
this outsourcing extends from prototyping to volume manufacturing and includes activities such as material procurement  final assembly  test  quality control  and shipment to distribution centers 
today the majority of our products are assembled in mexico 
our primary distribution center is operated on an outsourced basis in texas 
the components that make up our products are purchased from various vendors  including key suppliers such as broadcom  which supplies system controllers 
some of our components  including system controllers  chassis  remote controls  hard drives  and certain discrete components are currently supplied by sole source suppliers 
we often require substantial lead time to purchase components and manufacture anticipated quantities of dvrs that enable the tivo service 
this long lead time requires us to make component purchasing and inventory decisions well in advance of our peak selling periods 
we offer our individual end users who purchase from tivo 
com a day money back guarantee 
we typically do not offer a right of return or significant extended payment terms to our retailers 
seasonality sales of our tivo owned dvrs and subscriptions to the tivo service are affected by seasonality 
thus  we generate a significant number of our annual dvr sales and new tivo owned subscriptions during and immediately after the holiday shopping season with associated increases in revenue 
we also incur significant increases in expenses in the second half of the year related to hardware costs  revenue share and other payments to channel  and sales and marketing  subscription acquisition costs in anticipation of the holiday shopping season 
there is less seasonality associated with our mso customers 
competition we believe that the principal competitive factors in the advanced television market  which includes dvrs and other broadband enabled consumer electronic devices are brand recognition and awareness  functionality  ease of use  content availability  and pricing 
we currently see two primary categories of competitors for the tivo owned channel dvrs offered by satellite  cable  and telecommunications operators and advanced television products and dvrs offered by consumer electronics and software companies 
competition in the tivo owned subscription business 
our retail products compete in the united states against services sold directly by cable  telecommunications  and satellite operators including dish formerly echostar  directv  comcast  time warner cable  verizon  and at t 
these products typically combine pay television reception with dvr functionality  most of these products include multiple tuners  high definition recording  and in some cases multi room viewing capability 
some of these products are offered at lower prices but in many cases are bundled with other services provided by the operator and the price for the dvr and dvr service may not be apparent to the consumer 
in addition  these products are usually professionally installed and may appeal to consumers who do not proactively select a dvr service 
additionally  many us cable operators are currently deploying video on demand technology  which over time could serve as a substitute to our retail products 
we are aware of at least one us cable operator  cablevision  inc  which is deploying remote storage based dvr products 
to the extent that cable operators offer regular television programming as part of their server based vod offerings and dvr technology  consumers may prefer not to acquire an independent set top based dvr through retail channels 
our retail products also compete against products with on demand internet enabled services offered by consumer electronics companies including personal computers microsoft based pcs and apple products among others enable a variety of entertainment features and services which offer alternatives to traditional dvr services  primarily via internet delivery of content 
broadband capable devices and game consoles we are seeing a proliferation of broadband enabled devices  such as connected televisions  smartphones  single purpose broadband set top boxes and gaming consoles that offer broadband delivered content 
though these devices do not offer the breadth of the tivo service  they do offer alternative ways to access internet delivered video content through devices that many consumers may seek to acquire for other purposes 
for example  many consumer electronics companies have television or dvd products that are internet enabled and others have built dedicated devices for accessing video over the internet such as appletv and googletv 
similarly  companies such as sony and microsoft have now enabled the digital delivery of video programming over the internet to their game consoles 
competition in our mso business 
our mso revenues depend upon both our ability to successfully negotiate agreements with our service provider customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
we face competition from companies such as nds  microsoft  motorola  cisco  arris  and rovi  which have created competing products that provide user interface software for use on television set top boxes and consumer electronic devices 
such companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers and consumer electronics manufacturers 
we also face competition from internal development initiatives at some large service providers and consumer electronics manufacturers who may choose to develop similar products on their own rather than resell products services developed by tivo 
competition in the media services business 
digital video recorder services  in general  and tivo  specifically  compete with other advertising media such as print  radio  television  video on demand  internet  and other emerging advertising platforms for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services  in general  and tivo specifically  as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to advertise on the tivo service 
in addition  advertisers may not support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology s ability to fast forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness of general television advertising 
we compete with audience research companies such as nielsen  kantar media research  and rentrak for research spend from advertisers  advertising agencies  and television networks 
these companies have all announced intentions to provide second by second viewership information based on data from digital cable set top boxes and satellite set top boxes 
the type of research we provide is a discretionary purchase 
if advertisers  advertising agencies  and television networks perceive the information provided by these companies to be more valuable  they may invest in those services rather than ours  or they may choose not to purchase this type of information at all 
patents and intellectual property we have filed patent applications relating to numerous inventions resulting from tivo research and development  including many critical aspects of the design  functionality  and operation of tivo products and services as well as technology that we may incorporate in future products and services 
we have been awarded approximately foreign and domestic patents and have approximately foreign and domestic patent applications pending 
for example  tivo owns us patent no 
 titled multimedia time warping system referred to as the time warp patent or the patent which describes an invention that allows an user to store selected television shows while the user is simultaneously watching or storing another program and expires in july the time warp patent has been through reexamination at the united states patent office twice and had its claims upheld without modification 
the majority of our patents have expirations beyond tivo is prosecuting an intellectual property lawsuit against verizon  including for willful infringement of the time warp patent 
during the fiscal year ended january   tivo entered into separate settlements of pending intellectual property lawsuits it had filed against dish network and at t inc for million and million  respectively 
tivo is also defending counterclaims from verizon and a lawsuit from motorola  in addition to other intellectual property litigation 
see the discussions in item a 
risk factors  relating to pending intellectual property litigation  and item legal proceedings 
tivo has secured numerous foreign and domestic trademark registrations for its distinctive marks  including but not limited to registrations  for the marks tivo  the tivo logo  season pass  thumbs logos  and certain sound marks 
we anticipate ongoing progress in our establishment of a defensible and useful intellectual property portfolio  however  we cannot assure you that current patents will be enforceable or our current patent applications will ever be allowed or granted 
see part i 
item a 
risk factors our success depends on our ability to secure and protect our patents  trademarks  and other proprietary rights and pending intellectual property litigation for additional information concerning our intellectual property 
privacy policy we have adopted a privacy policy  which we make available on our website at www 
tivo 
com privacy and deliver to each new subscriber to the tivo service 
this policy was last updated in february to cover new features that we have introduced and plan to introduce in the future 
this policy explains that we collect certain types of information such as anonymous viewing and diagnostic information  but unless the subscriber gives prior consent  we do not collect or access personally identifiable viewing information from a subscriber s dvrs except as necessary to provide service to the dvr 
we further give subscribers the ability to opt out from the collection of anonymous viewing information and diagnostic information log files 
we have designed a system that ensures that any anonymous viewing information transmitted from a tivo enabled dvr remains unidentifiable to a particular viewer known as anonymous viewing information 
anonymous viewing information is collected separately from any information that identifies a viewer personally 
as a result  we may be able to use this anonymous information to tell a broadcast or advertising client the percentage of our viewers that recorded a particular program or advertisement  but we will not know  nor be able to tell the client  which of our viewers did so  unless a viewer decides to provide that information 
employees at february   we employed approximately employees  including in service operations  in research and development  in sales and marketing  and in general and administration 
we also employ  from time to time  a number of temporary and part time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  train  retain  and motivate highly qualified employees 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike 
our management considers employee relations to be good

risk factors risk factors an investment in our securities involves risks 
you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this offering memorandum before investing in the notes 
any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects  which in turn could adversely affect our ability to repay the notes and the trading price of the notes and our common stock 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or those 
table of contents currently viewed by us to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have incurred significant net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
during the fiscal years ended january    and  our net income losses were million  million  and million  respectively 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the size of future net losses will be impacted by a number of factors  including the timing of the development or deployment of solutions under our television service provider arrangements  the growth or decline in the number of tivo owned subscriptions  the price at which we sell tivo owned set top boxes  the amount of research and development expenses we incur to fund new product development and expand our engineering services capacity  the amount and timing of litigation expenses we incur in connection with protecting our intellectual property and the outcomes of our intellectual property litigations 
in particular  we expect to incur significant net losses in our fiscal year ending january  unless and until we generate significant additional revenues or substantially reduce our expenses  including revenues and expenses resulting from our ongoing legal proceedings  we will likely continue to incur losses in our current and future fiscal years and we may never achieve sustained profitability 
over time  continued net losses and negative cash flow could drain our existing cash balance 
we are a party to patent infringement lawsuits involving verizon and motorola 
we are incurring material litigation expenses as a result  and an adverse outcome in any of these lawsuits could harm our business 
our claims against verizon 
on august   we filed a complaint against verizon communications  inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas for infringement of the following three tivo patents us patent nos 
 b multimedia time warping system   b system for time shifting multimedia content streams  and  b automatic playback overshoot correction system 
our complaint seeks  among other things  damages for past infringement and a permanent injunction  similar to that issued by the united states district court  eastern district of texas against echostar 
we continue to incur material expenses in connection with this lawsuit  and in the event we were to lose  our business would be harmed 
verizon s claims against us 
on february   verizon answered our august  complaint and verizon asserted counterclaims 
the counterclaims seek declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity of the patents we asserted against verizon in our august  complaint 
additionally  verizon alleged infringement by us of us patents  apparatus and method of selecting video programs based on viewers preferences   dynamically programmable digital entertainment terminal using downloaded software to control broadband data operations   digital entertainment terminal providing dynamic execution in video dial tone networks   two dimensional navigation of multiplexed channels in a digital video distribution system  and  electronic program guide system with sideways surfing capability 
on march   verizon filed an amended answer further alleging infringement by us of us patent no 
 apparatus and methods for network access using a set top box and television 
verizon seeks  among other things  damages and a permanent injunction 
we continue to incur material expenses in connection with this lawsuit  and in the event we were to lose  we could be forced to pay damages for infringement or to license technology from verizon  and we could be subject to an injunction preventing us from infringing verizon s technology or otherwise affecting our business  and in any such case  our business would be harmed 
motorola s claims against us 
on february   motorola mobility  inc and general instrument corporation  a subsidiary of motorola  filed a complaint against us in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas seeking declaratory judgment of non infringement and invalidity of two of the patents we asserted against verizon in our august  complaint 
additionally  motorola alleged infringement of us patents  in home digital video unit with combined archival storage and high access storage   method and apparatus for implementing playback features for compressed video and  method and apparatus for implementing playback features for compressed video 
motorola seeks  among other things  damages and a permanent injunction 
we continue to incur material expenses in connection with this lawsuit  and in the event we were to lose  we could be forced to pay damages for infringement  to license technology from motorola  and we could be subject to an injunction preventing us from infringing motorola s technology or otherwise affecting our business  and in any such case  our business would be harmed 

table of contents intellectual property claims against us could be extremely costly  could result in the loss of significant rights  and could require us to alter our current product and business strategy and could force us to cease operating our business  in which case our business would be harmed 
in addition to the litigation discussed above  we are subject to  or otherwise engaged in  a significant number of pending intellectual property litigation proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  we are sued in court or receive letters from third parties alleging that we are infringing on their intellectual property 
regardless of their merit  we are forced to devote time and resources to respond to these lawsuits and letters 
in addition  if any of these third parties or others were to be successful in suing us  our business could be harmed because intellectual property litigation may be time consuming and expensive  divert management s attention and resources away from our business  cause delays in product delivery and new service introduction  cause the cancellation of current or future products or services  require us to pay significant amounts in damages  royalties and or licensing fees  incur material expenses as a result of our indemnification obligations  and result in an injunction that could force us to limit the functionality of our products and services  stop importing our products and services into certain markets  or cease operating our business altogether 
the emerging advanced television industry is highly litigious 
additionally  many patents covering interactive television technologies have been granted but have not been commercialized 
a number of companies in the advanced television industry earn substantial profits from technology licensing  and the introduction of new technologies by us is likely to provoke lawsuits from such companies 
a successful claim of infringement against us  our inability to obtain an acceptable license from the holder of the patent or other right  or our inability to design around an asserted patent or other right could cause our manufacturers to cease manufacturing dvrs that enable the tivo service  our retailers to stop selling the product or us to cease providing our service  or all of the above  which would eliminate our ability to generate revenues 
under our agreements with many of our manufacturing and licensing partners  we may be required to indemnify them in the event that our technology infringes upon the intellectual property rights of third parties 
due to these indemnity obligations which include infringement of third party intellectual property rights and may also include indemnification for open source software violations  we could be forced to incur material expenses if our manufacturing and licensing partners are sued 
if they were to lose the lawsuit  our business could be harmed 
in addition  because the products sold by our manufacturing and licensing partners often involve the use of other persons technology  this increases our exposure to litigation in circumstances where there is a claim of infringement asserted against the product in question  even if the claim does not pertain to our technology 
we face risks in connection with our marketing and distribution agreements for the development and deployment of tivo branded advanced television solutions and services to our marketing partners and distributors  particularly as our ability to perform and meet such contractual arrangements may be dependent on our ability to gain access to certain necessary third party technologies 
we face significant technological challenges in our development of the tivo service for our marketing partners and distributors  such as charter  cox  comcast  virgin  and ono  among others  as well as our dependence on certain third party technology providers who we depend upon to provide technology to us to allow us to meet the agreed upon feature and technology requirements requested by our television service providers 
for example  we rely on access to and receipt of certain technologies from third parties to enable video on demand and other content and search features on our products 
additionally  we are engaged in active intellectual property infringement suits with parties that we may otherwise rely on for the delivery of necessary technologies for enablement of key features of our products and as required by our contractual arrangements with our television service provider customers 
for example  we are engaged in patent infringement litigation with motorola and previously with microsoft  who also license technology to us for use in our products to enable certain features 
if we were unable to gain access to such technologies on reasonable commercial terms  we may be unable to provide certain features and functionalities in our products 
in such an event  our products may not be competitive with similar products in the market and further we may not be able to comply with the contractual arrangements with certain of our television service provider  in either case our business would be harmed as a result 
our ability to benefit from these agreements is dependent upon the mass deployment and adoption of our tivo branded advanced television solutions  which may include tivo branded dvrs  third party set top boxes which run tivo 
table of contents software  and dvr and non dvr set top boxes  among other solutions  by the subscribers of our distribution customers and marketing partners 
for example  we are currently in trials in certain geographic markets with charter and in the initial stages of deployment with other distribution customers  such as ono 
if we are unable to complete development of these products in a timely and efficient manner to the satisfaction of our distribution customers  which includes hiring and retaining the necessary number of engineers and software developers to develop each partner s customized solution  correctly estimating the amount of time and resources that are necessary to develop each such solution  licensing necessary third party technology such as  for example  technology which enables the display of vod content from our partners  and enabling full scale deployment of our tivo branded advanced television solutions and services with these marketing partners and distributors  we may not be able to acquire new subscribers from them under these agreements and our business would be harmed 
furthermore  some of our partners have the right to receive certain most favored terms from us such that if we were to license similar products and services to other parties at more attractive terms than what such partners receive under their agreements with us  then such partners may be entitled to receive the new more favorable terms 
additionally  such partners may have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event we are subject to certain specified change of control transactions involving companies specified in their agreements 
if any of these events occurred  including our inability to develop  license  and deploy in a timely  efficient  and on a full scale basis  we would have difficulty generating revenues and new subscriptions under these agreements and our business would be harmed 
if we fail to adequately manage our increasingly complex distribution agreements  including licensing  development  and engineering services  we could be subjected to unexpected delays in the expected deployment of tivo s advanced television solutions  increased costs  possible penalties and adverse accounting and contractual consequences  including termination of such distribution arrangements 
in any such event  our business would be harmed 
in connection with our deployment arrangements  we engage in complex licensing  development  and engineering services arrangements with our marketing partners and distributors 
these deployment agreements with television service providers usually provide for some or all of the following deliverables software engineering services  solution integration services  hosting of the tivo service  maintenance and support 
in general  these contracts are long term and complex and often rely on the timely performance of such television service provider s third party vendors that are outside tivo s control 
the engineering services and technology we agree to provide and or develop may be essential to the functionality of the licensed software and delivered product or such software may involve significant customization and modification for each customer 
we have experienced or may experience delays in delivery with television service providers including  for example  directv  virgin  suddenlink  ono  and charter  as well as significant increases in expected costs of development and performance in certain instances in the past 
additional delays could lead to additional costs and adverse accounting treatments forcing us to recognize costs earlier than expected 
if we are unable to deliver the contracted for technology  including specified customizations and modifications  and services in a timely manner or at all  then we could face penalties in the form of unreimbursed engineering development work  loss of subscriber or minimum financial commitments on the part of our partners or in extreme cases the early termination of such distribution agreements 
in any such case our business would be harmed 
if we fail to properly estimate  manage  and perform the development and engineering services for our television service provider customers  we could incur additional unexpected expenses and losses which could reduce or even eliminate any profit from these deployment arrangements  in which case our business would be harmed 
when we enter into deployment agreements with television service providers  we are typically required to make cost estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions 
these estimates are assessed continually during the term of the contract and revisions are reflected when the conditions become known 
using different cost estimates related to engineering services may produce materially different operating results  in addition to differences in timing and income statement classification of related expenses and revenues 
an unfavorable change in estimates could result in a reduction of profit due to higher cost or the recording of a loss once such a loss becomes known to us that would be borne solely by us 
we also recognize revenues for software engineering services that are essential to the functionality of the software or involve significant customization or modification using the percentage of completion method 
we recognize revenue by measuring progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred  principally labor  to total estimated costs of the project  an input method 
if we are unable to properly measure and estimate our progress toward completion in such circumstances  we could incur unexpected additional costs  be required to recognize certain costs earlier than expected  or otherwise be required to delay recognition of revenues unexpectedly 
a material inability to properly 
table of contents manage  estimate  and perform these development and engineering services for our television service provider customers could cause us to incur unexpected losses and reduce or even eliminate any profit from these arrangements  and in such a case our business would be harmed 
many of our current deployment arrangements with television service providers require us to incur significant upfront development and engineering expenses for which we are in total or in part compensated through service fees received after a solution is launched 
if we are required to incur such upfront development and integration costs in excess of any development revenues and we are reasonably assured that these excess upfront development costs are recoverable  we will defer such cost and recognize them on a zero margin or straight line basis after the solution is launched 
however  despite the deferral of these development costs  we do incur cash outflows associated with these development efforts resulting in potentially higher cash usage in the near term 
in situations where we are recovering upfront project specific development costs  we would start recognizing service revenues and related margin only after the initial project specific development costs are fully recovered 
as of january   we had approximately million in such project specific deferred costs 
the assessment of recoverability is highly dependent on our estimates of engineering and operating costs related to the project 
as a consequence  it may be a significant period of time after a solution launches and after we are adding new subscriptions from such deployment arrangement before we experience a corresponding impact on our service revenues and related margins from such a deployment arrangement 
if we fail to properly estimate  manage  and perform these development and engineering services and otherwise comply with the terms of these deployment arrangements  we could incur additional unexpected expenses and losses in connection with these arrangements 
in the event of an early termination of these arrangements with our television service provider customers prior to deployment  we would be forced to recognize any deferred development costs which we have incurred but not recognized without corresponding revenues from development or subscription fees  in such an event we would be forced to incur unexpected losses 
from time to time during development and integration for our television service provider customers  we or our customers may request to revise certain terms of our contracts or statements of work to modify such deliverables required or to otherwise address circumstances and technological requirements not anticipated by the parties when the contract or statement of work was originally agreed upon 
additionally  from time to time  we have and may in the future experience delays in our development work with our television service provider customers like ono and charter  which may cause us to modify the terms of those arrangements in the future 
if we were to fail in modifying the terms of these arrangements to the satisfaction of both parties and the arrangements were unexpectedly terminated early  we would have to recognize immediately any associated deferred costs that may no longer be deemed recoverable 
in such an event that we would have to recognize early such deferred development and integration costs  we would be required to do so without any corresponding revenue in which case we would incur unexpected losses which would harm our business 
our success depends on our ability to secure and protect our patents  trademarks  and other proprietary rights 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology 
we rely on patent  trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees  customers  partners  and others to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
we have filed patent applications and provisional patent applications covering much of the unique technology used to deliver the tivo service and its features and functionality 
to date  several of these patents have been granted  but we cannot assure you that any additional patents will ever be granted  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property or that third parties will not challenge any issued patents 
for example  several of our european patents  including foreign counterparts of our time warp patent  are the subject of proceedings before the opposition division of the european patent office 
opposition proceedings may result in changes to certain claims or revocation of a patent 
in addition  other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies that design around any patents that may be issued to us 
our failure to secure and protect our proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we generate a significant amount of revenue from our patent settlement agreements with dish and at t which expire in calendar year  and if we are unable to renew or replace these revenues  our business could be harmed 
in fiscal year  we entered into patent settlement agreements with dish and at t which will pay us recurring revenues until we generate a significant amount of revenues as a result from these settlement agreements 
if we are unable to renew or replace these revenues through similar or other business arrangements  
table of contents our revenues would decline and our business would be harmed as a result 
we face intense competition from a number of sources  which may impair our revenues  increase our subscription acquisition costs  and hinder our ability to generate new subscriptions 
the dvr and advanced television solutions market is rapidly evolving  and we face significant competition 
moreover  the market for in home entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
as a result of this intense competition  we could incur increased subscription acquisition costs that could adversely affect our ability to reach or sustain profitability in the future 
if new technologies render the dvr market obsolete  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the dvr and advanced television solutions market are brand recognition and awareness  functionality  ease of use  availability  and pricing 
we currently see two primary categories of dvr competitors and advanced television solutions competitors dvrs and advanced television solutions eg vod based services on set top boxes which stream content remotely offered by telecommunications  cable and satellite operators and dvrs and other advanced television solutions eg vod based services on set top boxes or other consumer electronic devices tv  bluray player  etc 
which stream content remotely offered by consumer electronics and software companies 
for more information on our competitors  see our discussion on competition in item business in our annual report on form k incorporated by reference herein 
licensing competitors 
our revenues depend both upon our ability to successfully negotiate agreements with our consumer electronics and service provider customers and  in turn  upon our customers successful commercialization of their underlying products 
we face competition from companies such as microsoft  directv  dish  pace  motorola  cisco  nds who recently announced it was being acquired by cisco  arris  and rovi  each of which have created competing digital video recording technologies 
such companies may offer more economically attractive agreements to service providers and manufacturers of dvrs 
we face a number of competitive challenges in the sale and marketing of the tivo service and products that enable the tivo service 
our success depends upon the successful retail marketing of the tivo service and related dvrs  which began in the third quarter of calendar year we compete with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services for consumer spending 
dvrs and the tivo service compete in markets that are crowded with other consumer electronics products and home entertainment services 
the competition for consumer spending is intense  and many consumers on limited budgets may choose other products and services over ours 
dvrs compete for consumer spending with products such as dvd players  satellite television systems  personal computers  video game consoles  and other dedicated video streaming devices such as roku  appletv  and boxee 
the tivo service competes with home entertainment services such as cable and satellite television  movie rentals  pay per view  video on demand  and mail order dvd services 
such competition may impair our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of these products or services have established markets  broad user bases  and proven consumer acceptance 
in addition  many of the manufacturers and distributors of these competing devices and services have substantially greater brand recognition  market presence  distribution channels  advertising and marketing budgets and promotional activities  and other strategic partners 
faced with this competition  we may be unable to effectively differentiate our dvrs and the tivo service from other consumer electronics devices or entertainment services and our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be harmed 
consumers may not be willing to pay for our products and services or we may be forced to discount our products and services 
many of our customers already pay monthly fees for cable or satellite television 
we must convince these consumers to pay an additional subscription fee to receive the tivo service 
consumers may perceive the tivo service and related dvr as too expensive 
in order to continue to grow our subscription base  we have lowered the price of our dvrs in the past and raised our subscription pricing and alternatively we may choose to raise our dvr pricing and lower our subscription pricing in the future 
as a result of lower hardware pricing and higher subscription pricing  the profitability of such newly acquired customers was shifted outward in time as we need to first recoup the expenses incurred in connection with the sale of a heavily subsidized dvr 
for competitive and financial reasons  we may need to change the pricing of our dvrs and our service fees again in the future 
the availability of competing services that do not require subscription fees or that are enabled by low or no cost dvrs will harm our ability to effectively attract and retain subscriptions  including at a financially attractive level  in such an event our business would be harmed 

table of contents growth in our tivo owned subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by offerings by our television distribution partners who also would be able to offer the tivo service in the future 
our ability to grow our tivo owned subscriptions and related revenues could be harmed by competition from our television distribution partners  such as directv  rcn  suddenlink  charter in the future and others  who may be able to offer tivo branded dvr and non dvr solutions to their customers at more attractive pricing than we may be able to offer the tivo service to our tivo owned customers 
furthermore  if we are unable to sufficiently differentiate the tivo service offered direct to consumers by tivo from the tivo branded dvr solutions offered by our licensing partners  customers who would have otherwise chosen the tivo service offered direct to consumers by us may instead choose to purchase the tivo branded dvr solution from our licensing partners 
additionally  to the extent that potential customers defer subscribing to the tivo service in order to wait for announced  but not yet deployed in their geographic area  tivo branded dvr solutions from our licensing partners  the growth of our tivo owned subscriptions could be reduced 
if our tivo owned subscriptions continue to decrease  our business will be harmed 
we compete with digital cable  satellite  and telecommunications dvrs 
cable  satellite  and telecommunications service providers are accelerating deployment of integrated cable and satellite receivers with dvrs that bundle dvr services with other digital services and do not require their customers to purchase hardware 
if we are not able to enter into agreements with these service providers to embed the tivo service into their offerings  our ability to attract their subscribers to the tivo service would be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we also expect to compete with digital cable  satellite  and telecommunications services that provide consumers with dvr and vod based services via a network connection on an on demand basis 
we are aware of at least one us cable operator  cablevision  inc  which has deployed server based dvr technology 
to the extent that cable  satellite  or telecommunication operators offer regular television programming with dvr services as part of their server based vod offerings or offer linear television programming in other vod based broadband delivered services  consumers would have an alternate means of watching time shifted shows besides physical dvrs 
in such an event  competitors would be able to deploy competing dvr services or equivalent vod based viewing services such as the tv everywhere service from comcast without the expense of deploying dvr hardware in consumer homes 
such an event would impair our ability to compete in a cost effective manner with these television providers as well as attract and retain customers  in which case  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we are currently only able to offer a high definition dvr that has access to digital cable signals 
only the cable industry in the united states is currently required to provide access to digital high definition television signals through cablecard technology 
without separate agreements with satellite operators  such as our agreement with directv  or other telecommunication providers  who offer television service  such as at t  that would give us access to digital and high definition television  our ability to attract their subscribers to the tivo service is limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
it is expensive to establish a strong brand 
we believe that establishing and strengthening the tivo brand is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our products and services and to establishing key strategic relationships 
the importance of brand recognition will increase as current and potential competitors enter the dvr market with competing products and services 
our ability to promote and position our brand depends largely on the success of our marketing efforts and our ability to provide high quality services and customer support 
these activities are expensive and we may not generate a corresponding increase in subscriptions or revenues to justify these costs 
if we fail to establish and maintain our brand  or if our brand value is damaged or diluted  we may be unable to attract subscriptions and effectively compete in the dvr market 
we rely on our retail customers and service providers to market and distribute our products and services 
in addition to our own efforts  our retail customers distribute dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we rely on their sales forces  marketing budgets  and brand images to promote and support dvrs and the tivo service 
additionally  we now have arrangements with certain service providers  such as comcast  to market and promote the tivo service 
we expect to continue to rely on our relationships with these companies to promote and support dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the loss of one or more of these companies could require us to undertake more of these activities on our own 
as a result  we would spend significant resources to support the tivo service and dvrs and other devices that enable the tivo service 
the failure of one or more of these companies to provide anticipated marketing support will require us to divert more of our limited resources to marketing the tivo service 
if we are unable to provide adequate marketing support for dvrs and the tivo service  our ability to attract subscriptions to the tivo service will be limited 
many consumers are not aware of the full range of benefits of our products and services 
dvr products 
table of contents and services are a continually evolving consumer electronic category 
retailers  consumers  and potential partners may perceive little or no benefit from dvr products and services 
many consumers are not aware of its benefits  such as the ability to seamlessly integrate linear and broadband vod based video  time shifting of linear television  transfer of recorded programs to portable devices  access to web based and broadband delivered content not available through traditional cable and satellite operators  and therefore may not value the benefits of the tivo service and products 
we will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time and resources to educate consumers and promote our products in order to increase our subscriptions 
we cannot be sure that a broad base of consumers will ultimately subscribe to the tivo service or purchase the products that enable the tivo service 
we face competitive risks in the provision of an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content through broadband  including from broadband devices connected directly to the tv or through a pc connected to the tv 
we have previously launched access to the entertainment offerings of amazon video on demand service  netflix  hulu plus  pandora  and others for the distribution of digital content directly to broadband connected tivo dvrs 
our offerings with amazon video on demand  netflix  hulu plus  pandora  and others typically involve no significant long term commitments 
we face competitive  technological  and business risks in our on going provision of an entertainment offering involving the distribution of digital content through broadband to consumer televisions with amazon  netflix  and others  including availability of premium content and speed and quality of the delivery  including the availability of high definition content  of such content to tivo dvrs 
for instance  we face increased competition from a growing number of broadband enabled devices from providers such as roku  appletv  and google that provide broadband delivered digital content directly to a consumer s television connected to such a device 
additionally  we face competition from online content providers and other pc software providers who deliver digital content directly to a consumer s personal computer  which in some cases may then be viewed on a consumer s television 
if we are unable to provide a competitive entertainment offering with amazon video on demand  netflix  hulu plus  pandora  and our other partners  on our own  or an equivalent offering with other third parties  the attractiveness of the tivo service to new subscribers could be harmed as consumers increasingly look for new ways to receive and view digital content and our ability to retain and attract subscribers could be harmed 
our ability to retain our current customers may continue to decrease in the future which could increase our tivo owned subscription monthly churn rate and could cause our revenues to suffer 
we believe factors such as increased competition in the dvr marketplace  failure by us to continue to innovate and deliver new features on current deployed dvrs as well as deliver new dvr models in the future  changing television technologies such as the increasing penetration of high definition  the use of switched digital technology to deliver encrypted digital television signals  and the failure of cable operators in the future to transmit both an analog and digital transmission thus impacting our series dvrs  increased price sensitivity in the consumer base  any deterioration in the quality of our service  and product lifetime subscriptions no longer using our service may cause our tivo owned subscription monthly churn rate to increase 
if we are unable to retain our subscriptions by limiting the factors that we believe increase subscription churn  our ability to grow our subscription base could suffer and our revenues could be harmed 
the product lifetime subscriptions to the tivo service that we currently are obligated to service commit us to providing services for an indefinite period 
the revenue we generate from these subscriptions may be insufficient to cover future costs and will negatively impact our tivo owned average revenue per subscription 
we offer a product lifetime subscription option to the tivo service that commits us to provide the tivo service for as long as the dvr is in service 
we receive product lifetime subscription fees for the tivo service in advance and amortize these fees as subscription revenue over months for product lifetime subscriptions which is our current estimate of the service life of the dvr 
if these product lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than anticipated  we will incur costs such as telecommunications and customer support costs without a corresponding subscription revenue stream and therefore will be required to fund ongoing costs of service from other sources  such as advertising revenue 
additionally  if these product lifetime subscriptions use the dvr for longer than the period in which we recognize revenue  our average revenue per subscription arpu for our tivo owned subscriptions will be negatively impacted as we continue to count these customers as subscriptions without corresponding subscription revenue thus lowering our average revenues across our tivo owned subscription base 
as of january   we had approximately  product lifetime subscriptions that had exceeded the 
table of contents month period we use to recognize product lifetime subscription revenues and had made contact with the tivo service within the prior six month period 
we will continue to monitor the useful life of a tivo enabled dvr and the impact of higher churn  increased competition  and compatibility of our existing tivo units with high definition programming 
future results will allow us to determine if our useful life is shorter or longer than currently estimated  in which case we may revise the estimated life and we would recognize revenues from this source over a shorter or longer period 
from time to time  we have agreed to share a substantial portion of the revenue we generate from subscription fees with some of our marketing partners  retailers  and consumer electronics companies 
we may be unable to generate enough revenue to cover these obligations 
in certain instances from time to time  we have agreed to share a substantial portion of our subscription and other fees with some of our marketing partners  retailers  and certain consumer electronics manufacturing companies in exchange for manufacturing  distribution and or marketing support  and or discounts on key components for dvrs 
in some cases  these agreements have required us to share substantial portions of the subscription and other fees attributable to the same subscription with multiple companies 
these agreements also typically require us to share a portion of our subscription fees whether or not we increase or decrease the price of the tivo service 
if we decrease our subscription fees in response to competitive or other market factors  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our decision to share subscription revenues has been based on our expectation that these relationships will help us obtain subscriptions  broaden market acceptance of our dvrs  and increase our future revenues 
if these expectations are not met  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses and obligations in which case our business would be harmed 
we face intense competition for advertising revenues 
dvr services  in general  and tivo  specifically  compete with other advertising media such as print  radio  television  internet  video on demand and other emerging advertising platforms for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers do not perceive digital video recording services  in general  and tivo specifically  as an effective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to advertise on the tivo service 
in addition  advertisers may not support or embrace the tivo technology due to a belief that our technology s ability to fast forward through commercials will reduce the effectiveness of general television advertising 
the nature of some of our business relationships may restrict our ability to operate freely in the future 
from time to time  we have engaged and may engage in the future in discussions with other parties concerning business relationships  which have and may in the future include equity investments by such parties in us or may include exclusivity provisions 
while we believe that such business relationships have historically enhanced our ability to finance and develop our business model or otherwise were justified by the terms of the particular relationship  the terms and conditions of such business relationships may place some restrictions on the operation of our business  including where we operate  who we work with  and what kinds of activities we may engage in  in the future 
if our technological security measures are compromised  or if the tivo service or our website is subject to attacks that prevents our customers from using the tivo products and services  our customers may curtail or stop use of our products 
the tivo service and tivo products such as dvrs may contain the private information of our customers  and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  which could result in potential liability and litigation 
like all services that connect with the internet  our service  including our website  is vulnerable to break ins  attacks  attempts to overload our servers with denial of service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems  any of which could lead to interruptions  delays  or shutdowns of our service  causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or other confidential information 
if we experience compromises to our security that result in service and website performance or availability problems  the complete shutdown of our service or website  or the loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information  our customers may lose trust and confidence in us  and decrease or discontinue their use of our service 
further  outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our information or our customers information 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems change frequently  often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world  we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers  cause existing customers to cancel their subscriptions  subject us to third party lawsuits  regulatory fines or other action or liability  thereby harming our operating results 

table of contents we depend on a limited number of third parties to manufacture  distribute  and supply critical components  assemblies  and services for the dvrs that enable the tivo service 
we may be unable to operate our business if these parties do not perform their obligations 
the tivo service is enabled through the use of a dvr manufactured for us by a third party contract manufacturer 
in addition  we rely on sole suppliers for a number of key components for the dvrs 
we also rely on third parties with whom we outsource supply chain activities related to inventory warehousing  order fulfillment  distribution  and other direct sales logistics 
we cannot be sure that these parties will perform their obligations as expected or that any revenue  cost savings  or other benefits will be derived from the efforts of these parties 
if any of these parties breaches or terminates their agreement with us or otherwise fails to perform their obligations in a timely manner  we may be delayed or prevented from commercializing our products and services 
because our relationships with these parties are non exclusive  they may also support products and services that compete directly with us  or offer similar or greater support to our competitors 
any of these events could require us to undertake unforeseen additional responsibilities or devote additional resources to commercialize our products and services 
this outcome would harm our ability to compete effectively and achieve increased market acceptance and brand recognition 
in addition  we face the following risks in relying on these third parties if our manufacturing relationships are not successful  we may be unable to satisfy demand for our products and services 
we manufacture dvrs that enable the tivo service through a third party contract manufacturer 
delays  product shortages  and other problems could impair our retail distribution and brand image and make it difficult for us to attract subscriptions 
in addition  the loss of a manufacturer would require us to identify and contract with alternative sources of manufacturing  which we may be unable to do or which could prove time consuming and expensive 
we are dependent on sole suppliers for several key components and services 
if these suppliers fail to perform their obligations  we may be unable to find alternative suppliers or deliver our products and services to our customers on time 
we currently rely on sole suppliers for a number of the key components used in the tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service 
for example  broadcom is the sole supplier of the system controller for our dvr 
we do not currently have a long term written supply agreement with broadcom 
therefore  broadcom may not be contractually obligated to supply us with these key components on a long term basis or at all 
we do have written supply agreements with several other sole suppliers for key components or services for our products such as remote solutions  askey  and flextronics 
tribune is the sole supplier of the program guide data for the tivo service 
tribune media services  inc  tribune  is the current sole supplier of program guide data for the tivo service 
our current television listings data agreement with tribune originally became effective on may  and has an initial term of five years and with tivo having the right to renew the agreement for four additional years  which tivo has elected to exercise 
the agreement provides each party with a termination right if the other party becomes controlled by certain third parties 
tribune media services  along with their parent company  tribune co  filed chapter bankruptcy on december  as a result  tribune or tribune media services  inc could reject the television listing data agreement and we would be left with only an unsecured claim in tribune s bankruptcy 
if tribune breaches its obligation to provide us with data  rejects the agreement or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under our agreement  we would be unable to provide certain aspects of the tivo service to our customers until we are able to incorporate an alternate source of guide data 
while we have access to alternative sources of guide data  there would be significant cost and delay involved in integrating such an alternative source of guide data 
depending upon the amount of notice we receive of such a breach or rejection of our agreement  and the amount of development work required by us to incorporate an alternate source of guide data  we may be subject to a period of time in which we are unable to provide the tivo service to our customers and distribution partners 
in such an event  our business would be harmed 
if our arrangements with broadcom or tribune or with our third party contract manufacturer were to terminate or expire without a replacement arrangement in place  or if we or our manufacturers were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of these components or required program guide data from our suppliers  our search for alternate suppliers could result in significant delays  added expense or disruption in product or service availability 
we depend upon third parties to provide supply chain services related to inventory management  order fulfillment  and direct sales logistics 
we rely on third party vendors to provide cost effective and efficient supply chain services 
among other activities  these outsourced services relate to direct sales logistics  including 
table of contents order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing  and distribution of inventory to third party retailers 
if one or several of our third party supply chain partners were to discontinue services for us  our ability to fulfill direct sales orders and distribute inventory timely  cost effectively  or at all  would be hindered which could in turn harm our business 
we are dependent on our major retail partners for distribution of our products to consumers 
we currently rely on our relationships with major retail distributors including best buy  who is our sole brick and mortar nationwide consumer electronics retailer  and others for distribution of tivo enabled dvrs 
we do not typically enter into long term volume commitments with our major retail distributors 
if one or several of our major retail partners were to discontinue selling our products  the volume of tivo enabled dvrs sold to consumers could decrease which could in turn harm our business 
we face significant risks in overseeing our outsourcing of manufacturing processes as well as in the management of our inventory  and failure to properly oversee our manufacturing processes or to effectively manage our inventory levels may result in product recalls or supply imbalances that could harm our business 
we have contracted for the manufacture of certain tivo enabled dvrs with a contract manufacturer 
we sell these units to retailers and distributors  as well as through our own online sales channels 
product manufacturing is outside our core business and we face significant risks if our contract manufacturer does not perform as expected 
if we fail to effectively oversee the manufacturing process  including the work performed by our contract manufacturer  we could suffer from product recalls  poorly performing product  and higher than anticipated warranty costs 
in connection with our manufacturing operations  we maintain a finished goods inventory of the dvr units we produce throughout the year 
due to the seasonality in our business and our long lead time product development and manufacturing cycles  we need to make forecasts of demand and commit significant resources towards manufacturing of our dvr units well in advance of our peak selling periods 
we also have risks with respect to changing hardware forecasts with our television service provider customers who may revise their purchase forecasts lower after we have committed manufacturing resources to meeting such forecasts due to long lead times and prior to the time in which such television service provider forecasts become contractually binding 
as such  we are subject to significant risks in managing the inventory needs of our business during the year  including estimates of the appropriate mix of demand across our older and newer dvr models 
if we were to overestimate demand for our dvrs  we may end up with inventories that exceed currently forecasted demand which would require us to record additional write downs 
should actual market conditions differ from our estimates  our future results of operations could be materially affected 
in the future  we may be required to record additional write downs of finished products and materials on hand and or additional charges for excess purchase commitments as a result of future changes in our sales forecasts 
we face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work  including outsourcing of software work oversees  which  if not properly managed  could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property  increased costs due to inefficient and poor work product  and subject us to export control restrictions which could impede or prevent us from working with partners internationally  which could harm our business  including our financial results  reputation  and brand 
we have from time to time outsourced engineering work related to the design  development  and manufacturing of our products  typically to save money and gain access to additional engineering resources 
we have and expect to in the future work with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the united states  including  but not limited to  india  ukraine  united kingdom  and mexico 
we have limited experience in the outsourcing of engineering  manufacturing  and other work to third parties located internationally that operate under different laws and regulations than those in the united states 
if we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of this engineering  manufacturing and other work related to our products  we could suffer the loss of valuable intellectual property  or the loss of the ability to claim such intellectual property  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  and copyrights 
we could also be subjected to increased regulatory and other scrutiny related to export control restrictions which could impede or prevent us from working with international partners 
additionally  instead of saving money  we could in fact incur significant additional costs as a result of inefficient engineering services and poor work product 
as a result our business could be harmed  including our financial results  reputation  and brand 
product defects  system failures  or interruptions to the tivo service may have a negative impact on our revenues  damage our reputation and decrease our ability to attract new customers 
our ability to provide uninterrupted service and high quality customer support depends on the efficient and 
table of contents uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems 
our computer hardware and other operating systems for the tivo service are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism  and similar misconduct 
these types of interruptions in the tivo service may reduce our revenues and profits 
we currently house the server hardware that delivers the tivo service at only one location  however  in the event that location became unavailable  we do have a backup facility capable of delivering the tivo service 
our business also will be harmed if consumers believe our service is unreliable 
in addition to placing increased burdens on our engineering staff  service outages will create a flood of customer questions and complaints that must be responded to by our customer support personnel 
any frequent or persistent system failures could irreparably damage our reputation and brand and possibly trigger requests for refunds on subscription fees and hardware purchases and possible consumer litigation 
we have detected in the past and may continue to detect software and manufacturing errors in our products in the future 
these problems can affect system uptime and result in significant warranty and repair problems  which could cause customer service and customer relations problems 
correcting errors in our software or fixing defects in our products requires significant time and resources  which could delay product releases and affect market acceptance of the tivo service 
any delivery by us of products or upgrades with undetected material product defects or software errors could harm our credibility and market acceptance of the dvrs and the tivo service 
in addition  defective products could cause a risk of injury that may subject us to litigation or cause us to have to undertake a product recall 
for example  we previously became aware of occasions where a part came loose from the remote control device that comes with the dvrs that enable the tivo service  including occurrences where a young child gagged on or ingested a part of the remote control device 
while we are unaware of any injuries resulting from the use of our products  we may be subject to products liability litigation in the future 
additionally  if we are required to repair or replace any of our products  we could incur significant costs  which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to create or maintain multiple revenue streams  we may not be able to cover our expenses and this could cause our revenues to decrease and net losses to increase 
our long term success will depend on securing additional revenue from such areas as licensing  advertising  audience research measurement  and electronic commerce 
in order to derive substantial revenues from these activities  we will need to attract and retain a large and growing base of subscriptions to the tivo service 
we also will need to work closely with television advertisers  cable  satellite  and telecommunications network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers to develop products and services in these areas 
we may not be able to work effectively with these parties to develop products that generate revenues that are sufficient to justify their costs 
we also may be unable to work with  or to continue working with  these parties to distribute video and collect and distribute data or other information to provide these product or services 
in addition  we are currently obligated to share a portion of these revenues with several of our strategic partners 
any inability to attract and retain a large and growing group of subscriptions or inability to attract new strategic partners or maintain and extend our relationships with our current strategic partners would seriously harm our ability to support new services and develop new revenue streams 
if we are unable to introduce new products or services  or if our new products and services are unsuccessful  the growth in our subscription base and revenues may suffer 
to attract and retain subscriptions and generate revenues  we must continue to maintain and add to our functionality and content and introduce products and services which embody new technologies and  in some instances  new industry standards 
this challenge will require hardware and software improvements  as well as maintaining and adding new collaborations with programmers  advertisers  network operators  hardware manufacturers  and other strategic partners 
these activities require significant time and resources and may require us to develop and promote new ways of generating revenue with established companies in the television industry 
these companies include television advertisers  cable and satellite network operators  electronic commerce companies  and consumer electronics manufacturers 
in each of these examples  a small number of large companies dominate a major portion of the market and may be reluctant to work with us to develop new products and services for digital video recorders as well as maintain our current functionality 
if we are unable to 
table of contents maintain and further develop and improve the tivo service or maintain and expand our operations in a cost effective or timely manner  our ability to attract and retain customers and generate revenue will suffer 
we must manage product transitions successfully in order to remain competitive 
the introduction of a new product or product line is a complex task  involving significant expenditures in research and development  training  promotion and sales channel development  and management of existing product inventories to reduce the cost associated with returns and slow moving inventory 
as new products are introduced  we intend to monitor closely the inventory of products to be replaced  and to phase out their manufacture in a controlled manner 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to execute product transitions in this manner or that product transitions will be executed without harming our operating results 
failure to develop products with required features and performance levels or any delay in bringing a new product to market could significantly reduce our revenues and harm our competitive position 
if we fail to manage the growth and complexity of our activities  it could disrupt our business and impair our ability to generate revenues 
the growth in our subscription base and increasing complexity of our sources of other revenue have placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources and systems 
specific risks we face as our business expands include any inability of our systems to accommodate future subscription growth  or any inability of our tivo 
com website to handle customer traffic  may cause service interruptions or delay our introduction of new services and limit our ability to sell the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs 
we internally developed many of the systems we use to provide the tivo service and perform other processing functions 
the ability of these systems to scale as we add new subscriptions is unproven 
we must continually improve these systems to accommodate subscription growth and to add features and functionality to the tivo service 
our inability to add software and hardware or to upgrade our technology  systems or network infrastructure could adversely affect our business  cause service interruptions or delay the introduction of new services 
our inability to manage customer traffic and sales volume through our tivo 
com website could limit our ability to sell the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs in the future 
if our website were to become unavailable for a significant amount of time  our ability to provide certain features of the tivo service and our ability to service customers and sell the tivo service and tivo enabled dvrs would be harmed 
we will need to provide acceptable customer support  particularly with respect to installation of dvrs and cablecards tm  and any inability to do so would harm our brand and ability to retain current subscriptions and generate new subscriptions 
our ability to increase sales  retain current and future subscriptions and strengthen our brand will depend in part upon the quality of our customer support operations  including our ability to assist customers with installation and cablecard tm related issues 
some customers require significant support when installing the dvr and required cablecards tm for our hd dvrs and becoming acquainted with the features and functionality of the tivo service 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products  services  and cablecard tm installation requirements to a diverse customer base  and we may not have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers require 
in addition  we have entered into agreements with third parties to provide this support and will rely on them for a substantial portion of our customer support functions 
furthermore  the installation of a cablecard tm for tivo customers may be performed by third party cable operators and tivo would then be dependent on such parties to timely service new subscribers to enable their receipt of digital and premium cable content 
our failure to provide adequate customer support for the tivo service  dvrs  and a cablecard tm will damage our reputation in the dvr and consumer electronics marketplace and strain our relationships with customers and consumer electronics manufacturers 
this could prevent us from gaining new or retaining existing subscriptions and could cause harm to our reputation and brand 
we will need to improve our operational and financial systems to support our growth in the future  increasingly complex business arrangements  and rules governing revenue and expense recognition and any inability to do so will adversely affect our billing and reporting 
we have increasingly complex business arrangements  and the rules which govern revenue and expense recognition in our business are increasingly complex as well 
to manage the expected growth of our operations and increasing complexity  we will need to improve our operational and financial systems  procedures and controls and continue to increase systems automation to reduce reliance on manual operations 
any inability to do so will affect our billing and reporting 
our current and planned systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our complex arrangements and the rules governing revenue and expense recognition for our future operations and expected growth 
delays or problems associated with any improvement or expansion of our 
table of contents operational and financial systems and controls could adversely affect our relationships with our customers  cause harm to our reputation and brand  and could also result in errors in our financial and other reporting 
the nature of our business requires the application of complex revenue and expense recognition rules and the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting us generally accepted accounting principles gaap is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
the accounting rules and regulations that we must comply with are complex and continually changing 
recent actions and public comments from the securities exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
in addition  many companies accounting policies are being subject to heightened scrutiny by regulators and the public 
while we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we cannot predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies on our financial statements going forward 
in addition  were we to change our critical accounting estimates  including the timing of recognition of revenue from our product lifetime subscriptions  our results of operations could be significantly impacted 
we face risks associated with various cable operators making their own transition to digital transmission of cable signals 
we face increased risks in addition to the digital transition as cable operators were only required to carry analog signals for customers through february where cable operators transmit in both analog and digital formats 
cable operators who transmit entirely in digital format to their customers and make set top boxes available to such customers are exempted from the dual carriage mandate 
our business faces increased risks as cable operators convert their systems to transmit in all digital format because our dual tuner standard definition series dvr is reduced to a single tuner experience when used exclusively with a cable set top box and no analog cable transmission is available 
the lack of an analog signal being transmitted by the cable operator means that the dvr would only be able to use one tuner to record television although all the model dvrs we currently sell to our customers are high definition digital video recorders which are cablecard capable and not subject to this risk 
in the event that the features and functionality of our series dvrs currently deployed with customers are impacted  such an impact may cause such customers to cancel their subscriptions 
the migration of cable systems to all digital transmissions could result in increased customer churn or deter new customers from subscribing to the tivo service with these older model dvrs  and in such an event our business would be harmed 
if there is increased use of switched digital video technologies to transmit television programs by cable operators also known as switched digital in the future  the desirability and competitiveness of our current products could be reduced in which case our business would be harmed 
we rely on conditional access security cards supplied by cable operators called cablecards tm for certain types of our dvrs to receive encrypted digital television signals without a cable operator supplied set top box 
these dvrs presently are limited to using cablecards tm to access digital cable  high definition  and premium cable channels like hbo that are delivered in a linear fashion where all programs are broadcast to all subscribers all the time 
certain cable operators are deploying switched digital video technologies to transmit television programs in an on demand fashion switched digital only to subscribers who request to watch a particular program 
although cable operators are deploying a solution to enable our customers to receive channels delivered with switched technologies known as the tuning adapter  if this technology is not successful or is not adopted by our customers due to cost  complexity  or functionality  then the increased use of switched technologies and the continued inability of our products to receive switched cable programming without a tuning adapter may reduce the desirability and competitiveness of our products and services and adversely affect sales of our tivo owned subscriptions in which case our business would be harmed 
we have limited experience and face significant competition in providing service and operations internationally that are subject to different competitors  laws  regulations  and requirements than those in the united states and our inability to compete or comply with such laws  regulations  and requirements could harm our reputation  brand  and have a negative impact on revenues 
we have provided and expect to continue to provide the tivo service in jurisdictions outside of the united states  such as the united kingdom  spain  mexico  canada  australia  and new zealand 
however  we have limited experience in international operations 
we face significant competition and technological challenges in competing with other consumer electronics manufacturers in these jurisdictions and in complying with international laws and technological standards such the various digital over the air standards like dvb t 
if we are unable to properly manage our international operations or comply with international laws  regulations  and requirements  we could suffer damage to our reputation  brand  and revenues and as a result our business could be harmed 
we 
table of contents have and expect to continue to partner with local broadcasters  cable television operators  and satellite providers to provide the tivo service internationally 
transactions with international partners may never materialize or may not result in significant revenue for us and may result in significant costs 
entertainment companies and other content owners may claim that some of the features of our dvrs violate copyright or trademark laws  which could force us to incur significant costs in defending such actions and affect our ability to market the tivo service and the products that enable the tivo service 
although we have not been the subject of such actions to date  a past competitor s dvrs were the subject of several copyright infringement lawsuits by a number of major entertainment companies  including the major television networks 
these lawsuits alleged that the competitor s dvrs violate copyright laws by allowing users to skip commercials  delete recordings only when instructed and use the internet to send recorded materials to other users 
tivo enabled dvrs have some similar features  including the ability to fast forward through commercials  the ability to delete recordings only when instructed and the ability to transfer recordings from a tivo enabled dvr to a pc and or portable media devices via tivotogo transfers 
based on market or consumer pressures  we may decide in the future to add additional features that may be objectionable to entertainment companies 
if similar actions are filed against us based on current or future features of our dvrs  entertainment companies may seek injunctions to prevent us from including these features and or damages 
such litigation can be costly and may divert the efforts of our management 
furthermore  if we were ordered to remove features from our dvrs  we may experience increased difficulty in marketing the tivo service and related tivo enabled dvrs and may suffer reduced revenues as a result 
entertainment companies  networks  or video distributors may claim that our advertising products or features may unintentionally violate copyright or trademark laws or otherwise unfairly compete with them  which could result in the blocking  stripping or failure to carry out our advertising products or features or force us to incur significant costs in defending such actions and affect our ability to generate advertising revenues 
entertainment companies  networks  or video distributors may claim that our advertising products or features may unintentionally violate copyright or trademark laws  or otherwise unfairly compete with them  by being placed within  adjacent to  or on top of  existing video programming or advertising 
entertainment companies or video distributors may seek injunctions to prevent us from offering these products or features  seek damages and or take other measures  such as blocking  stripping or refusing carriage to prevent us from selling or distributing our advertising products 
if we were unable to sell or distribute our advertising products or features on our dvrs  we may suffer reduced revenues as a result 
we use open source software in our products  which could expose us to intellectual property infringement claims  require us to provide indemnification to third parties  and delay or prevent development of certain products or features  any of which could harm our business 
tivo s products include open source software 
from time to time  we may face claims seeking to enforce the terms of an applicable open source license 
such claims could result in litigation  require us to seek licenses from third parties in order to keep offering our software  require us to re engineer our software  require us to release proprietary source code  require us to provide indemnification or otherwise subject us to liability to a customer or supplier  or require us to discontinue the sale of a product in the event re engineering cannot be accomplished in a timely manner  any of which could adversely affect our business 
if we release software that includes open source software licensed under version of the gnu general public license gplv  even if it was software provided to us by a supplier  we may be required to provide end users with the ability to install modified software on their tivo product  which could adversely affect our business 
if gplv is widely adopted among the open source community  we may be unable to use future open source enhancements or components in our software  which could adversely affect our business 
dvrs could be the subject of future regulation relating to copyright law or evolving industry standards and practices that could adversely impact our business 
in the future  copyright statutes or case law could be changed to adversely impact our business by restricting the ability of consumers to temporally or spatially shift copyrighted materials for their own personal use 
our business could be harmed as a result 
in addition  we are aware that some media companies may attempt to form organizations to develop standards and practices in the dvr industry 
these organizations or individual media companies may attempt to require companies in the digital video recorder industry to obtain copyright or other licenses 
lawsuits or other actions taken by these types of organizations or companies could make it more difficult for us to introduce new services  delay widespread consumer acceptance of our products and services  restrict our 
table of contents use of some television content  increase our costs  and adversely affect our business 
legislation  laws or regulations that govern the consumer electronics and television industry  the delivery of programming  access to television signals  and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions could expose us to legal action if we fail to comply and could adversely impact and or could require us to change our business 
the delivery of television programming  access to television signals by consumer electronics devices  and the collection of viewing information from subscriptions via the tivo service and a dvr represent a relatively new category in the television and home entertainment industries 
as such  it is difficult to predict what laws or regulations will govern our business 
changes in the regulatory climate  the enactment of new legislation  or the expansion  contraction  enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations could expose us to additional costs and expenses and could adversely impact or require changes to our business 
for example  legislation regarding customer privacy or copyright could be enacted or expanded to apply to the tivo service  which could adversely affect our business 
laws or regulations could be interpreted to prevent or limit access to some or all television signals by certain consumer electronics devices  or impose limits on the number of copies  the ability to transfer or move copies  or the length of time a consumer may retain copies of some or all types of television programming 
new or existing copyright laws could be applied to restrict the capture of television programming  which would adversely affect our business 
it is unknown whether existing laws and regulations will apply to the digital video recorder market 
therefore  it is difficult to anticipate the impact of current or future laws and regulations on our business 
we may have significant expenses associated with staying appraised of local  state  federal  and international legislation and regulation of our business and in presenting tivo s positions on proposed laws and regulations 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has broad jurisdiction over the telecommunications and cable industries 
the fcc could promulgate new regulations  or interpret existing regulations in a manner that would cause us to incur significant compliance costs or force us to alter or eliminate certain features or functionality of the tivo products or services which may adversely affect our business 
for example  the fcc could determine that certain of our products fail to comply with regulations concerning matters such as electrical interference  copy protection  digital tuners  or display of television programming based on rating systems 
the fcc could also impose limits on the number of copies  the ability to transfer or move copies  the length of time a consumer may retain copies  or the ability to access some or all types of television programming 
compliance with federal securities laws and regulations is costly 
the federal securities laws and regulations  including the corporate governance and other requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and subsequent laws impose complex and continually changing regulatory requirements on our operations and reporting 
these requirements impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members  and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these requirements have increased and will continue to increase our legal compliance costs  increase the difficulty and expense in obtaining director and officer liability insurance  and make it harder for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors and or qualified executive officers 
such developments could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
our business could be adversely impacted if we have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting 
the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting may not prevent all errors  misstatements or misrepresentations 
while management continues to review the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  we cannot assure you that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time 
for instance  recognizing the significant increase in our investments of cash as a result of our on going patent litigation  we have instituted controls to monitor compliance with the investment company act of the act 
if we fail to maintain compliance with the act in the future  such noncompliance could have significant adverse impact on our business 
deficiencies  particularly a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting  which may occur in the future could result in misstatements of our results of operations  restatements of our financial statements  a decline in our stock price  the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global market  or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  reputation  results of operation  financial condition or liquidity 
we advertise  market  and sell our services directly to consumers  many of these activities are highly 
table of contents regulated by constantly evolving state and federal laws and regulations and violations of these laws and regulations could harm our business 
we engage in various advertising  marketing  and other promotional activities  such as offering gift subscriptions to consumers  which are subject to state and federal laws and regulations 
a constantly evolving network of state and federal laws is increasingly regulating these promotional activities 
additionally  we enter into subscription service contracts directly with consumers which govern both our provision of and the consumers payment for the tivo service 
for example  consumers who activate new monthly subscriptions to the tivo service may be required to commit to pay for the tivo service for a minimum of one year or be subject to an early termination fee if they terminate prior to the expiration of their commitment period 
if the terms of our subscription service contracts with consumers  such as our imposition of an early termination fee  or our previously offered rebate or gift subscription programs were to violate state or federal laws or regulations  we could be subject to suit  penalties  and or negative publicity in which case our business could be harmed 
we and the third party vendors we work with will need to remain compliant with the payment card industry requirements for security and protection of customer credit card information and an inability to do so by us or our third party vendors will adversely affect our business 
as a merchant who processes credit card payments from its customers  we are required to comply with the payment card industry requirements imposed on us for the protection and security of our customers credit card information 
if we are unable to successfully remain compliant with the payment card industry requirements imposed on us as a credit card merchant  our business could be harmed because we could be prevented in the future from transacting customer subscription payments by means of a credit card 
we need to safeguard the security and privacy of our subscribers confidential data and remain in compliance with laws that govern such data  and any inability to do so may harm our reputation and brand and expose us to legal action 
the dvr collects and stores viewer preferences and other data that many of our customers consider confidential 
any compromise or breach of the encryption and other security measures that we use to protect this data could harm our reputation and expose us to potential liability 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography  or other events or developments could compromise or breach the systems we use to protect our subscribers confidential information 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to remedy problems caused by any breaches 
additionally  the laws governing such data are constantly changing and evolving and we must comply with these laws or our business  including our reputation  brand and financial results will be harmed 
uncertainty in the marketplace regarding the use of data from subscriptions could reduce demand for the tivo service and result in increased expenses 
consumers may be concerned about the use of viewing information gathered by the tivo service and the dvr 
currently  we gather anonymous information about our customers viewing choices while using the tivo service  unless a customer affirmatively consents to the collection of personally identifiable viewing information 
this anonymous viewing information does not identify the individual customer 
privacy concerns  however  could create uncertainty in the marketplace for digital video recording and for our products and services 
changes in our privacy policy could reduce demand for the tivo service  increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation costs or increased service delivery costs  or otherwise harm our reputation and business 
legislation  laws or regulations relating to environmental issues  employment matters  and unclaimed property may adversely impact our business in the future 
it is possible that future proposed environmental regulations on consumer electronic devices  such as dvrs and set top boxes  may regulate and increase the production  manufacture  use  and disposal costs incurred by us and our customers 
for example  the energy independence and security act of directs the department of energy to prescribe labeling or other disclosure requirements for the energy use of standalone digital video recorder boxes 
this and future energy regulations could potentially make it more costly for us to design  manufacture  and sell our dvrs to our customers thus harming the growth of our business 
additionally  as our business grows and we expand our employed and contracted work force  employment laws and regulations will have an increasing impact on our ability to manage and grow our work force 
regulations and laws relating to the status of contractors  classification and related benefits for exempt and non exempt employees all may adversely impact our business if we are unable to properly manage and comply with federal  state  and local laws 
furthermore  as part of our regular business activities now  and in the past  we engage in the issuance of gift 
table of contents subscriptions and the marketing of rebate offers related to the sale of our products and services 
it is possible that money received by us for the sale of gift subscriptions or related to our past rebate offers could be subject to state and federal escheat  or unclaimed property  laws in the future 
if this were the case  our business could be adversely impacted 
if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations relating to the collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes in the various states in which we do business  we could be exposed to unexpected costs  expenses  penalties  and fees as a result of our noncompliance in which case our business could be harmed 
as our business grows and expands  we have started to do business in an increasing number of states nationally 
by engaging in business activities in these states  we become subject to their various laws and regulations  including requirements to collect sales tax from our sales within those states and the payment of income taxes on revenue generated from activities in those states 
the laws and regulations governing the collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes are numerous  complex  and vary between states 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations requiring the collection of sales tax and payment of income taxes in one or more states where we do business  we could be subject to significant costs  expenses  penalties  and fees in which case our business could be harmed 
we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and our failure to comply with the laws and regulations there under could result in penalties which could harm our reputation  business  and financial condition 
we are subject to the fcpa  which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business 
the fcpa also requires companies to maintain adequate record keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect the transactions of the company 
under the fcpa  us companies may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives 
the fcpa and similar laws in other countries can impose civil and criminal penalties for violations 
if we do not properly implement practices and controls with respect to compliance with the fcpa and similar laws  or if we fail to enforce those practices and controls properly  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions  including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and restrictions on our business activities  all of which could harm our reputation  business and financial condition 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law could discourage a third party from acquiring us and consequently decrease the market value of our common stock 
in the future  we could become the subject of an unsolicited attempted takeover of our company 
although an unsolicited takeover could be in the best interests of our stockholders  certain provisions of delaware law and our organizational documents could be impediments to such a takeover 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by a consent in writing 
in addition  special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority of the total number of authorized directors  the chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or the holders of or more of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provide that directors may be removed only for cause by a vote of a majority of the stockholders and that vacancies on the board of directors created either by resignation  death  disqualification  removal or by an increase in the size of the board of directors may be filled by a majority of the directors in office  although less than a quorum 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides for a classified board of directors and specifies that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
these provisions of delaware law  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make it more difficult for us to be acquired by another company  even if our acquisition is in the best interests of our stockholders 
any delay or prevention of a change of control or change in management could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents in the future  our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we expect our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
therefore  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of results of operations as an indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some periods our operating results may fall below the expectations of market analysts and investors 
in such event  the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
factors that may affect our annual operating results include demand for tivo enabled dvrs and the tivo service  the timing and introduction of new services and features on the tivo service  seasonality and other consumer and advertising trends  entering into new or terminating existing strategic partnerships  timing of the roll out of the tivo service and delivery of customized set top boxes to our strategic partners  changes in our pricing policies  the pricing policies of our competitors and general pricing trends in the consumer electronics market  timing of revenue recognition under our agreements  loss of subscriptions to the tivo service  recruiting and retention of key personnel  and general economic conditions 
because our expenses precede associated revenues  unanticipated shortfalls in revenues could adversely affect our results of operations for any given period and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
consumer electronic product sales have traditionally been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year 
although predicting consumer demand for our products is very difficult  we have experienced that sales of dvrs and new subscriptions to the tivo service have been disproportionately high during the holiday shopping season when compared to other times of the year 
if we are unable to accurately forecast and respond to consumer demand for our products  our reputation and brand will suffer and the market price of our common stock would likely fall 
we expect that a portion of our future revenues will come from targeted commercials and other forms of interactive television advertising enabled by the tivo service 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be seasonal and cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities or increase the time it takes to close a sale with our advertisers  which could cause our revenues from advertisements to decline significantly in any given period 
if we are unable to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity  debt or other financing activities on acceptable terms  our ability to effectively manage growth and build a strong brand could be harmed 
we may incur debt to which covenants attach which could be violated if we do not meet our expectations 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through the next twelve months and beyond 
however  as we continue to grow our business  we may need to raise additional capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also incur debt which will subject us to restrictive covenants which if violated by us would cause us to incur penalties and increased expenses which could in turn harm our business 
if we cannot raise necessary additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will decline  stockholders may experience dilution in net book value per share  or these 
table of contents equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities by the number of authorized  but unissued and unreserved shares of our common stock available for issuance 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
for example  we may seek to leverage our existing and future revenues to raise capital for investing in future subscription growth initiatives 
such financing activities may involve the issuance of debt or other secured instruments tied to current or future revenues that may involve covenants limiting  or restricting our operations or future opportunities or may involve other risks to stockholders 
the large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price for our stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
several of our stockholders own a substantial number of our shares 
as of january   options to purchase a total of  shares and  unvested restricted stock awards and restricted stock units were outstanding under our option and equity incentive plans  and there were  shares available for future grants 
we have filed registration statements with respect to the shares of common stock issuable under our option and equity incentive plans 
future sales of the shares of the common stock  or the registration for sale of such common stock  or the issuance of common stock to satisfy our current or future cash payment obligations or to acquire technology  property  or other businesses  could cause immediate dilution and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale or issuance of such stock  as well as the existence of outstanding options and shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our option and equity incentive plans  also may adversely affect the terms upon which we are able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities 
our business could be adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster 
our corporate headquarters is located in alviso  california which is where the overwhelming majority of our employees work 
our primary servers are located nearby in san jose  california 
alviso and san jose lay near the san andreas fault  among other known and unknown faults  a major source of earthquake activity in california 
in the event of an earthquake or similar natural disaster  our ability to continue operations could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed

item legal proceedings 
table of contents from time to time  the company is involved in numerous lawsuits as well as subject to various legal proceedings  claims  threats of litigation  and investigations in the ordinary course of business  including claims of alleged infringement of third party patents and other intellectual property rights  commercial  employment  and other matters

while certain matters to which the company is a party specify the damages claimed  such claims may not represent reasonably possible losses 
given the inherent uncertainties of the litigation  the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time  nor can the amount of possible loss or range of loss  if any  be reasonably estimated 
as of january   the company has not accrued any liability for any lawsuits filed against the company  as the company has neither determined that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements nor that the amount of any loss can be reasonably estimated

securities litigation 
on june   the company and certain of its officers and directors tivo defendants were originally named as defendants in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
this action  which is captioned wercberger v 
tivo et al  also names several of the underwriters involved in the company s initial public offering ipo as defendants 
this class action is brought on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of the company s common 
table of contents stock from the time of the company s ipo october  through december  the central allegation in this action is that the underwriters in the company s ipo solicited and received undisclosed commissions from  and entered into undisclosed arrangements with  certain investors who purchased the company s stock in the ipo and the after market  and that the tivo defendants violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose in the ipo prospectus that the underwriters had engaged in these allegedly undisclosed arrangements 
more than issuers have been named in similar lawsuits 
in february  after the issuer defendants including the tivo defendants filed an omnibus motion to dismiss  the court dismissed the section b claim as to the company  but denied the motion to dismiss the section claim as to the company and virtually all of the other issuer defendants 
on october   the company s executive officers who were named as defendants in this action were dismissed without prejudice 
on june   the plaintiffs in the suit announced a proposed settlement with the company and the other issuer defendants 
this proposed settlement was terminated on june   following the ruling by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit on december   reversing the district court s granting of class certification in the six focus cases currently being litigated in this proceeding 
the proposed settlement had provided that the insurers of all settling issuers would guarantee that the plaintiffs recover damages from non settling defendants  including the investment banks who acted as underwriters in those offerings 
on august   the plaintiffs filed amended master allegations 
on september   the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification  which was subsequently withdrawn without prejudice by the plaintiffs 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the focus cases on november  on march   the court ruled on the motion to dismiss  holding that the plaintiffs had adequately pleaded their section b claims against the issuer defendants and the underwriter defendants in the focus cases 
as to the section claim  the court dismissed the claims brought by those plaintiffs who sold their securities for a price in excess of the initial offering price  on the grounds that they could not show cognizable damages  and by those who purchased outside the previously certified class period  on the grounds that those claims were time barred 
this ruling  while not binding on the company s case  provides guidance to all of the parties involved in this litigation 
on april   the parties lodged with the court a motion for preliminary approval of a proposed settlement between all parties to the consolidated action  including the company and its former officers and directors  as well as numerous other companies and their officers and directors 
any direct financial impact of the proposed settlement is expected to be borne by the company s insurers 
the proposed settlement also provides for full releases for the defendants  including the company and its former officers and directors 
on june   the federal district court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement 
on september   the federal district court held the fairness hearing for final approval of the settlement 
on october   the district court issued an order granting class certification and final approval of the settlement 
several individual or groups of individuals filed appeals with the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
on may   the second circuit court of appeals dismissed the appeals of all but one objector to the settlement  whose matter was remanded to the district court 
on august   the district court held on remand that the remaining objector was not a member of the settlement class 
on september   the remaining objector appealed the district court s august  ruling to the second circuit court of appeals 
on january   the remaining objector entered into a settlement agreement and dismissed its appeal with prejudice
