item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of novel synthetic dna and rna based drug candidates 
we are developing drug candidates that are designed to modulate immune responses mediated through toll like receptors  or tlrs 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells 
we believe that by modulating immune responses mediated through tlrs  we can develop compounds to treat a broad range of diseases 
we are also evaluating gene silencing oligonucleotides  or gsos  which inhibit the production of disease associated proteins by targeting rna 
we believe that our gso technology provides us with a platform from which drug candidates for diverse disease indications can be developed 
we are focusing our internal development efforts on tlr targeted clinical candidates for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cancer  and on the advancement of our gso technology platform 
we are seeking to advance our tlr targeted programs in infectious diseases  respiratory diseases  hematologic oncology  and the use of tlr agonists in vaccine adjuvant applications only through partnerships with third parties 
we currently are collaborating with merck sharp dohme corp 
formerly merck co  inc  which is referred to herein as merck  for the use of agonists of tlrs   and as vaccine adjuvants for cancer  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
we are developing imo  an antagonist of tlr and tlr  for the treatment of psoriasis 
a tlr antagonist is a compound that blocks activation of an immune response mediated through the targeted tlr 
we plan to conduct a phase clinical trial of imo in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over a four week treatment period 
we expect to initiate the trial in the second quarter of in addition  we have selected imo  an antagonist of tlrs   and  for development in the treatment of lupus 
we are conducting nonclinical studies of imo to support the submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  for imo we expect to submit the ind to the fda in the fourth quarter of we have evaluated imo and imo in preclinical models of several autoimmune diseases including psoriasis  lupus  rheumatoid arthritis  and multiple sclerosis 
in these models  treatment with imo or imo was associated with improvements in a number of disease parameters 
we are developing imo  an agonist of tlr  for the treatment of cancer 
a tlr agonist is a compound that stimulates an immune response through the targeted tlr 
in november  we reacquired rights to develop imo from merck kgaa  darmstadt  germany  our former collaborator 
we believe that imo can be developed for use as an immune modifier in combination with targeted anticancer agents 
recently  we announced favorable data from a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with erlotinib and bevacizumab in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer 
we anticipate top line data from a randomized phase clinical trial of imo in combination with cetuximab in second line patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the second quarter of we also expect in the second quarter of top line data from a phase b clinical trial of imo in combination with cetuximab and chemotherapy in patients with advanced colorectal cancer 
cetuximab  erlotinib  and bevacizumab are marketed under the names erbitux  tarceva  and avastin  respectively 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
we do not expect to generate significant product revenue  sales based milestones or royalties until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for drug candidates  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our drug candidates  we need to complete clinical development and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
in  we expect that our research and development expenses will be comparable to our research and development expenses in 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting policies and estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and series d redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants fit the description of critical accounting estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition an important part of our business strategy is to enter into research and development collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical corporations that bring expertise and resources to the potential research and development and commercialization of drugs based on our technology 
under our research and development collaborations  we have generally licensed specified portions of our intellectual property and provided research and development services to the collaborator during the period of continued involvement in the early portion of the collaborations 
our collaborators have generally been responsible for drug development activities initiated after the collaboration is effective 
our collaborators are also generally responsible for any commercialization activities that may be initiated if any of the drug candidates receive marketing approval from the appropriate regulatory authority 
the terms of our agreements have included non refundable license fees  research and development funding  payments based upon achievement of clinical and preclinical development milestones and royalties on product sales 
the following revenue recognition policy incorporates accounting standard update asu no 
 multiple element revenue arrangements and asu no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition both of which we adopted on january  these new accounting standards did not affect revenue that we earned through december  we plan to follow no 
prospectively for any arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
we plan to follow asu no 
prospectively for any future milestones 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting based on specified criteria such as whether the deliverable has standalone value to the collaborator 
any fixed or determinable payments that we expect to receive under the arrangement are allocated among the separate units of accounting and the appropriate revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of these separate units 
any item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with other appropriate items and the combined deliverable is treated as a separate unit of accounting 

table of contents our allocation of fixed or determinable payments to the separate units of accounting is based on the relative selling price method  which is based on the following hierarchy used in determining the selling price for each unit of accounting vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  the price at which the item is regularly sold by the vendor on a standalone basis  is the preferred method  third party evidence  or tpe  of vendors selling similar goods to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis if vsoe of selling price of a product or service is not available  and best estimate of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price of a product or service is available 
our timing of revenue recognition from upfront license fees received under collaboration agreements depends upon the terms of the agreement 
we recognize revenue from reimbursements earned in connection with research and development collaboration agreements as related research and development costs are incurred  and contractual services are performed  provided collectability is reasonably assured 
we include amounts contractually owed to us under these research and development collaboration agreements  including any earned but unbilled receivables  in receivables in our balance sheets 
our principal costs under these agreements are generally for our personnel and related expenses of conducting research and development  as well as for research and development performed by outside contractors or consultants or related research and development materials provided by third parties or for clinical trials we conduct on behalf of a collaborator 
for payments that are contingent upon milestone events or achieving a specific result from the research and development efforts  we recognize these milestone payments as revenue in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone provided the milestone meets the criteria specified below 
milestones typically consist of significant events in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies  and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments received under collaboration agreements in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone  provided that the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the amount attributed to the milestone is reasonable in relation to our performance and to the amounts attributed to the other deliverables in the arrangement and we have no further performance obligations relating to the milestone event 
in the event that the agreement provides for payment to be made subsequent to our standard payment terms  we recognize revenue when payment becomes due 
amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in our balance sheets 
we classify amounts that we expect to recognize in the next twelve months as short term deferred revenue 
we classify amounts that we do not expect to recognize within the next twelve months as long term deferred revenue 
although we follow detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
for example  we record deferred revenue  if any  on our balance sheet as short term or long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such amounts would be recognized 
however  these estimates are based on our collaboration agreement and our then current operating plan and  if either should change  we could recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the subsequent twelve month period 
our estimate of deferred revenue also reflects our estimate of the periods of our involvement in our collaborations and the estimated periods over which our performance obligations will be completed 
in some instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in subsequent periods 
such changes to estimates would result in a change in revenue recognition amounts 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in subsequent periods 
stock based compensation we recognize all share based payments to employees as expense in our financial statements based on their fair values 
we record compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at 
table of contents the date of grant 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense  adjusted for forfeitures  on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
prior to december  the vesting of all of our stock options was based on the passage of time and the employees continued service 
in december  we granted performance based stock options to purchase  shares of common stock to employees 
of this amount  options to purchase  shares will vest immediately upon the achievement of various performance conditions and options to purchase  shares will begin to vest over a three year service period upon the achievement of the same performance conditions 
we recognize expense over the implicit and explicit service periods for awards with performance conditions when we determine the achievement of the performance conditions to be probable 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values  including assumptions as to average risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected life and expected volatility 
for the assumed risk free interest rate  we use the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends to common stockholders and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
we use an expected option life based on actual experience 
our assumption for expected volatility is based on the actual stock price volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the option 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income loss  net income loss and earnings loss per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
although the black scholes option pricing model is widely used  existing valuation models  including the black scholes valuation model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
we recorded charges of million  million  and million in our statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively  for stock compensation expense attributable to share based payments made to employees and directors 
the decrease in stock compensation expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in the expense associated with employee options granted before and director options granted before  as well as stock compensation expense associated with the modification of stock options during as a result of our adoption of policies on the treatment of options in connection with director or employee retirement 
the increase in stock compensation expense for  as compared to  was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of expense associated with options granted in december in the period as compared to the period which reflected less than one month of expense associated with those options 
the modification of stock options during also contributed to the increase in stock compensation expense during series d redeemable convertible preferred stock and warrants on november   the company received net proceeds of  from the issuance of the series d redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series d preferred stock  and warrants 
we first assessed these financial instruments under asc  distinguishing liabilities from equity  and determined that neither financial instrument was within the scope of asc we then assessed these financial instruments under asc  derivatives and hedging as follows warrant 
we determined that the warrant was a derivative instrument as it contains a price protection feature that causes the warrant to not be considered indexed to the company s own stock and therefore  not qualify for the exemption requirements in asc we recorded the warrant at fair value as of the november  transaction date and will mark the recorded amount to fair value through earnings each quarter 
the fair value of the warrant was million on the november  transaction date and million at december  the million decrease in the fair value between november  and december  was recorded as non operating income in our statement of operations 

table of contents redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we determined that the series d preferred stock contained three embedded features optional redemption by the company  optional redemption by the holder and optional conversion by the holder 
we determined that each of the embedded features met the definition of a derivative 
we determined that the preferred stock should be considered an equity host for the purposes of assessing the embedded derivatives for potential bifurcation 
we noted the following regarding these embedded features optional redemption by the company and optional redemption by the holder 
we assessed the redemption features under asc to determine if they were eligible for the exemption from derivative accounting 
in order to meet the exemption the feature must be indexed to the company s own stock and meet specified criteria for equity classification 
we determined that both redemption features met these requirements and were not bifurcated 
optional conversion by the holder 
we determined that the optional conversion by holder feature was clearly and closely related to the preferred stock host 
as such the conversion feature did not require bifurcation under asc we then assessed the preferred stock under asc  debt  to determine if there was a beneficial conversion feature bcf 
we determined the value of the bcf by comparing the million financing proceeds allocated to the preferred stock  computed by reducing the million gross proceeds from the financing by the million fair value of the warrant  to the million intrinsic value of the common stock that the preferred stock could be converted into on the date of the financing 
based on this comparison  we determined the bcf to be million which we recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the price protection feature is triggered then additional bcf may be recorded 
as the preferred stock is redeemable  we have recorded it in temporary equity 
the initial carrying value of the series d preferred stock was million  after discounts for the portion of the financing proceeds allocated to the warrant liability  the bcf and the financing transaction costs 
since the series d preferred stock was immediately convertible  the million discount related to the bcf was immediately accreted to preferred dividends in our statement of operations  resulting in an increase in the carrying value of the series d preferred stock to million 
the series d preferred stock is optionally redeemable by the holder under a fundamental change for million plus any accrued but unpaid dividends 
since we have determined that a fundamental change is not currently probable  the remaining discount of million will only be accreted to preferred dividends in our statement of operations at the time that the redemption becomes probable  if ever 
if we had determined that the preferred stock was a debt host rather than an equity host  the conversion feature would have been bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative 
if the conversion feature had been accounted for as a derivative it would have been marked to fair value each quarter with the change in fair value being recorded in other income expense in our statement of operations 
this would have materially affected our net loss available for common stockholders and loss per share 
new accounting pronouncements we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standard update no 
 multiple element revenue arrangements asu no 
on january  asu no 
updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in accounting standards codification no 
in two ways 
the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in multiple element arrangements may be treated as separate units of accounting 

table of contents this is significant since it may result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
since we are applying asu no 
prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date and since there were no new collaborations or material modifications to existing collaborations in the year ended december   the adoption of asu no 
had no effect on our financial position and results of operations through december  the effect that asu no 
may have on our policy for recognizing revenue under any future collaboration agreements will depend upon the terms of those future collaboration agreements  if any 
we adopted fasb accounting standard update no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition asu no 
on january  asu no 
provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
we are applying asu no 
prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
since we did not earn any milestones during the year ended december   the adoption of asu no 
has had no effect on our financial position and results of operations through december  since we used a similar method of recognizing milestone revenue prior to adopting asu no 
 we do not expect that the adoption of asu no 
will have a significant effect on our policy for recognizing revenue on any milestones that we receive in future periods 
in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 fair value measurement topic asu no 
 which updates the existing fair value measurement guidance currently included in the accounting standards codification to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu is effective on a prospective basis to interim and annual periods beginning after december  we plan to evaluate the effect that asu may have on our fair value measurement policy 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 comprehensive income asu no 
 which will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the update does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
asu no 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect asu no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended december   and alliance revenue our alliance revenues are comprised primarily of revenue earned under various collaboration and licensing agreements which include license fees  research and development revenues  including reimbursement of internal and third party expenses  milestones and patent related reimbursements 

table of contents the following table is a summary of our alliance revenue earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements year ended december  annual percentage change in millions license fees research and development milestones other total alliance revenue license fees 
license fees primarily include license fee revenue recognized under our collaborations with merck kgaa and merck 
license fee revenue during and was comprised of amortization of the upfront license fee payments under these collaborations 
we recognized license fee revenue ratably over the expected period of our continuing involvement in the collaborations  which has generally represented the estimated research period of the agreement 
the following table is a summary of license fees recognized under our two principal collaborations during and year ended december  collaborator in millions merck kgaa merck we received a million upfront payment from merck kgaa in euros in february of which we received million due to foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the time 
we recognized the million upfront payment as revenue over the twenty eight month research term that ended in june we received a million upfront payment from merck in december we recognized the million upfront payment as revenue over the two year initial research term and the two year extension period that ended in december since we completed the research portions of these collaborations during  all of the upfront license fee payments were fully amortized by december consequently  the amount of license fee revenue that we recognized under the merck kgaa and merck collaborations decreased in and we did not recognize any license fee revenue during research and development revenue 
research and development revenues in and consisted of reimbursement of us by merck kgaa of costs incurred by us in connection with clinical trials under our collaboration agreement with merck kgaa 
by march  merck kgaa had assumed sponsorship of these phase b clinical trials of imo and the phase clinical trial in healthy subjects 
as a result  we did not incur any such costs or receive any such reimbursements in and as such did not recognize any research and development revenue in and research and development revenues decreased by million in compared to milestone revenue 
in  we received no milestones 
in  we received million as a result of the initiation by merck kgaa of the phase b clinical trial of imo in treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck scchn 
in  we received million in milestone payments as a result of the initiation of a phase b clinical trial in patients with colorectal cancer and the initiation by merck kgaa of a phase clinical trial of imo in patients with recurrent or metastatic scchn 

table of contents other revenue 
other revenue consisted of reimbursement by licensees of costs associated with patent maintenance 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in in the following table  research and development expense is set forth in five categories which are discussed beneath the table year ended december  annual percentage change in millions imo external development expense imo external development expense cost of regaining rights to cancer program in imo external development expense other drug development expense basic discovery expense imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo since november  when we commenced clinical development of imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
since november  we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with our clinical trials in healthy subjects we initiated in  manufacturing and process development activities related to the production of imo  and additional nonclinical toxicology studies 
the decrease in imo expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to lower costs in associated with nonclinical safety studies  lower expenses in associated with the manufacture of additional imo drug supplies  and the completion of all patient activities in with respect to our phase clinical trials 
these reductions in expenses for imo relative to expenses were partially offset by costs associated with the preparation for our planned week phase clinical trial in psoriasis that we subsequently did not initiate 
the increase in imo expenses in as compared to was primarily due to expenses associated with our phase clinical trials  we initiated in  nonclinical safety studies including million associated with the cancellation of previously scheduled nonclinical chronic toxicology studies during  and the manufacture of additional supplies of imo in we expect to initiate in the second quarter of a phase clinical trial to evaluate imo in adult patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis over a four week treatment period 
as a result  we expect imo expenses to increase in as compared to imo external development expenses 
imo is being developed for cancer  excluding vaccines 
external development expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development but exclude internal costs such as 
table of contents payroll and overhead expenses 
since  when we commenced clinical development of imo and through december   we have incurred approximately million in external expenses in connection with imo under our collaboration with merck kgaa  merck kgaa was responsible for developing imo for the treatment of cancer excluding vaccines 
prior to march  we conducted clinical trials of imo under the collaboration and merck kgaa reimbursed us 
as of march  merck kgaa assumed sponsorship of the one remaining ongoing clinical trial of imo for the treatment of cancer and responsibility for all further clinical development of imo in the treatment of cancer 
as a result of merck kgaa s assumption of sponsorship of the trials  we did not incur significant expenses for imo development in and  except for costs associated with the termination agreement discussed below 
on november   we entered into an agreement to terminate our collaboration with merck kgaa and to regain rights for developing tlr agonists for the treatment of cancer 
in connection with the termination agreement  we agreed to reimburse merck kgaa for up to million million at december  of merck kgaa s costs for the third party contract research organization that is coordinating the ongoing phase trial of imo in combination with cetuximab  payable in eleven installments commencing on march  including a final payment payable upon merck kgaa s completion of certain specified activities 
we also agreed to pay to merck kgaa one time million million at december  milestone payments upon occurrence of each of the following milestones i partnering of imo with any third party  ii initiation of any phase or phase clinical trial for imo and iii regulatory submission of imo in any country 
the million million at december  in installment payments represents the cost of regaining our rights to imo and follow on compounds for use in the treatment of cancer  excluding cancer vaccines  and was recorded as research and development expense in our statement of operations for the milestone payments will be recorded at the time that any milestones are achieved 
imo external development expenses decreased by million  or  in  as compared to  as a result of merck kgaa assuming sponsorship of the trials in september and in march we plan to determine our next steps in the development of imo after receiving the data from the phase clinical trial in scchn and from the phase b clinical trial in colorectal cancer 
imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo these external expenses include payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development activities conducted after the initiation of imo clinical development  but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead expenses 
we commenced clinical development of imo in may and since then we have incurred approximately million in external development expenses through december   including costs associated with our clinical trials manufacturing  process development activities related to the production of imo  and additional nonclinical toxicology studies 
the decrease in imo expenses in as compared to was attributable to decreases in costs associated with the phase clinical trial in null responder hcv patients that we initiated in september and the phase clinical trial in treatment naive hcv patients that we initiated in october  manufacturing which occurred in but not in  the preparation in for a phase clinical trial of imo in non responder hcv patients that we had planned to conduct  and a decrease in the cost of conducting additional nonclinical safety studies of imo the decrease in was partially offset by costs incurred in the first half of associated with preparation for the phase clinical trial of imo in treatment na ve hcv patients that we had planned to initiate in the second quarter of the increase in imo expenses in compared to was primarily due to increased expenses resulting from the two phase clinical trials  manufacture of additional supplies of imo in  conduct of additional nonclinical safety studies of imo  and the preparation for a phase clinical trial in non responder hcv patients 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we determined to discontinue further development of imo in the treatment of hcv 
as a result  we expect that imo external development expenses will be significantly lower in future periods 
other drug development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development 
in addition  these expenses include internal costs  such as payroll and overhead expenses  associated with preclinical development and products in clinical development 
the external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies  including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies  and professional fees 
expenses associated with products in clinical development include costs associated with our hepatitis c clinical advisory board and our autoimmune disease scientific advisory board 
the increase in other drug development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to increases in the cost of nonclinical studies of preclinical compounds  manufacturing expenses and consulting costs 
these increases reflect costs associated with preclinical studies to support the planned submission of an ind for imo during the fourth quarter of and were partially offset by lower employee expenses in the increase in other drug development expenses during also reflects the cost of obtaining nonclinical and clinical trial data from studies conducted by novartis of imo  a tlr agonist 
the decrease in other drug development expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to the inclusion of imo expenses incurred after the commencement of clinical development in november in the imo external development expense category shown separately above 
prior to november  nonclinical safety and pharmacology study expenses related to imo and costs to manufacture imo were included in the other drug development expenses category 
basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to our discovery efforts with respect to our tlr targeted programs  including agonists and antagonists of tlrs   and  tlr antisense  and gsos 
these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead expenses 
the decrease in basic discovery expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in the cost of laboratory supplies and employee expenses 
the increase in basic discovery expenses in from is primarily attributable to higher employee expenses  including higher stock compensation expense associated with stock options granted after september  and the addition of a vice president of biology to our discovery staff in july  and higher allocated facilities costs  offset by a decrease in research supplies related to decreased research conducted under our collaboration agreements and lower external nonclinical research costs 
we do not know if we will be successful in developing any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
at this time  without knowing the results of the ongoing phase clinical trial of imo and the planned phase clinical trial of imo  and without an established plan for future clinical tests of drug candidates  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing  and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  any drug candidate from our research and development programs 
moreover  the clinical development of any drug candidate from our research and development programs is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to 
table of contents million in general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated with our patent applications and maintenance  our corporate regulatory filing requirements  our corporate legal matters  and our business development initiatives 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to  was primarily due to decreases in stock based compensation  employee cash compensation expenses and consulting fees associated with business and strategic initiatives in the decrease in stock compensation expense during was mainly due to higher recognized expense in associated with the modification of non employee director stock options and lower expense recognized in due to options whose fair value had been fully amortized prior to the end of these decreases in general and administrative expenses were partially offset by increases in legal costs associated with patent matters in the million increase in general and administrative expenses from to was primarily due to higher stock compensation expense primarily resulting from stock options granted after september  and the modification of stock options during  higher employee expenses  higher legal fees related to patent maintenance and corporate matters  and increased consulting fees associated with business and strategic initiatives  offset  in part  by a decrease in allocated facilities costs 
decrease in fair value of warrant liability we recorded in a warrant liability of million reflecting the fair value of the warrants issued in our november financing 
the warrant was determined to be a derivative instrument since it contains a specified anti dilution provision that does not meet the indexed to the company s own stock exemption requirements in asc the warrant was classified as a liability  recorded at fair value as of the transaction date and will be marked to fair value through earnings each quarter 
the fair value of the warrants decreased to million at december  primarily due to a decrease in the price of our common stock 
the reduction in the fair value of the warrant liability resulted in the recognition of a million gain in other income for we expect that the fair value of the warrant liability will vary significantly in the future resulting in material non operating charges and credits in future periods 
investment income  net investment income decreased by million from million in to a negligible amount in the decrease in investment income in  as compared to  was due to lower average investment balances and lower interest rates in investment income amounted to million in income tax expense in  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately  which was primarily related to the carry back of net operating losses to recover alternative minimum tax as a result of the enactment of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of foreign currency exchange gain loss our foreign currency exchange gain was million in compared to a loss of in and a negligible amount in the foreign currency exchange gain during was primarily due to the impact that the strengthening value of the us dollar had on our euro denominated accrued liabilities associated with the cost of re gaining the rights to our cancer program and our clinical trial obligations 
the foreign currency exchange loss during was primarily due to the impact that fluctuations in us dollar euro currency exchange rates had on the receipt of milestone payments under our merck kgaa collaboration in the first and third quarters of in  we earned a milestone for which we had a million receivable at 
table of contents december  merck kgaa paid us for this milestone in february and we received million based on foreign exchange rates in effect at the time of payment as a result of the strengthening value of the us dollar 
consequently  we incurred a foreign currency exchange loss of million on the milestone payment during the first quarter of the foreign currency exchange loss during also reflects the impact that fluctuations in us dollar euro currency exchange rates have on payments under our clinical trial agreements that are denominated in euros and on the receipt of the milestone payment in the third quarter of when we earned a million milestone for which we received million based on foreign exchange rates in effect at the time of payment as a result of the weakening value of the us dollar  resulting in a foreign currency exchange gain of million 
preferred stock accretion and dividends the million in preferred stock accretion and dividends in consists of million related to the beneficial conversion feature of the series d preferred stock that we have accreted to preferred dividends  as described under critical accounting policies and estimates  and million in dividends payable on shares of our series d preferred stock 
net loss income applicable to common stockholders as a result of the factors discussed above  our net loss applicable to common stockholders was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had net income applicable to common stockholders of million for the year ended december  since january   we have primarily been involved in the development of our tlr pipeline 
from january  through december   we incurred losses of million

funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except  and  and we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect to incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
to date  almost all of our revenues have been from collaboration and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 

table of contents we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations at least into the first quarter of based on the current operating plan  including the phase clinical trial of imo in psoriasis that we plan to initiate in the second quarter of and the submission of an ind for imo  which we expect to occur in the fourth quarter of we will need to raise additional funds in order to operate our business beyond such time 
we will require substantial funds to conduct research and development  including preclinical testing and clinical trials of our drug candidates beyond the first quarter of we expect to seek additional funding through collaborations  the sale or license of assets or financings of equity or debt securities 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our ability to obtain additional funding are the results of our clinical and preclinical development programs  developments relating to our existing strategic collaboration with merck  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  competitive and potentially competitive products and technologies and investors receptivity to our drug candidates and the technology underlying them in light of competitive products and technologies  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies generally and companies with drug candidates and technologies such as ours specifically  and our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require additional funds or further cost reductions 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through collaborative alliances or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  drug candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our discovery or development programs and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products
