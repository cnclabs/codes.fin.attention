in  the corporation recorded a credit provision for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of 
fluctuations in the tax provision pre tax income rate for these periods include the impact of changes in the average holdings of tax exempt securities and loans 
also  the provision includes the reversal of a valuation allowance established in on certain deferred tax assets 
more detailed information concerning fluctuations in the corporation s earnings results are provided in other sections of management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the presentation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect many of the reported amounts and disclosures 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a material estimate that is particularly susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate and reasonable 
the corporation s methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is described in a separate section later in management s discussion and analysis 
given the very subjective nature of identifying and valuing loan losses  it is likely that well informed individuals could make materially different assumptions  and could  therefore calculate a materially different allowance value 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
another material estimate is the calculation of fair values of the corporation s debt securities 
for most of the corporation s debt securities  the corporation receives estimated fair values of debt securities from an independent valuation service  or from brokers 
in developing fair values  the valuation service and the brokers use estimates of cash flows  based on historical performance of similar instruments in similar interest rate environments 
based on experience  management is aware that estimated fair values of debt securities tend to vary among brokers and other valuation services 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management calculates the fair values of pooled trust preferred securities by applying discount rates to estimated cash flows for each security 
management estimated the cash flows expected to be received from each security  taking into account estimated levels of deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuers  and used discount rates considered reflective of a market participant s expectations regarding the extent of credit and liquidity risk inherent in the securities 
management s estimates of cash flows and discount rates used to calculate fair values of pooled trust preferred securities were based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could result in calculations of fair values that would be substantially different than the amounts calculated by management 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  management evaluates securities for otti 
in making that evaluation  consideration is given to the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether the corporation intends to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery 
management s assessments of the likelihood and potential for recovery in value of securities are subjective and based on sensitive assumptions 
also  management s estimates of cash flows used to evaluate otti of pooled trust preferred securities are based on sensitive assumptions  and use of different assumptions could produce different conclusions for each security 
net interest income the corporation s primary source of operating income is net interest income  which is equal to the difference between the amounts of interest income and interest expense 
tables i  ii and iii include information regarding the corporation s net interest income in   and in each of these tables  the amounts of interest income earned on tax exempt securities and loans have been adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
accordingly  the net interest income amounts reflected in these tables exceed the amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion that follows is based on amounts in the tables 
vs 
fully taxable equivalent net interest income was  in   higher than in as shown in table iii  net changes in volume had the effect of increasing net interest income  in compared to  and interest rate changes had the effect of increasing net interest income  the most significant components of the volume change in net interest income in were a decrease in interest expense of  attributable to a reduction in the balance of long term borrowed funds and an increase in interest income of  attributable to growth in the balance of available for sale securities 
the most significant components of the rate change in net interest income in were a decrease in interest expense of  due to lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits and a decrease in interest income of  attributable to lower rates earned on available for sale securities

net growth in the taxable available for sale securities portfolio was primarily made up of us government agency collateralized mortgage obligations and also included a significant increase in the balance of taxable municipal securities 
this growth was partially offset by reductions in the balances of us government agency bonds and pooled trust preferred securities 
the corporation s yield on taxable securities fell in and primarily because of low market interest rates  including the effects of management s decision to limit purchases of taxable securities to investments that mature or are expected to repay a substantial portion of principal within approximately four years or less 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for and in the average balance of gross loans decreased to  in from  in the corporation experienced modest contraction in the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  primarily resulting from management s decision to sell a portion of newly originated residential mortgages on the secondary market

although the rates of return on balances with the federal reserve are low  the corporation has maintained relatively high levels of liquid assets in and as opposed to increasing long term  available for sale securities at higher yields in order to maximize flexibility for dealing with possible fluctuations in cash requirements  and due to management s concern about the possibility of substantial increases in interest rates within the next few years 
also  in  management maintained a portion of the balance with the federal reserve in anticipation of repurchasing the tarp preferred stock and warrant 
these repurchases were completed during the third quarter during the fourth quarter  the corporation began investing in fdic insured certificates of deposit issued by other financial institutions and maturing within five years  these investments averaged  for and totaled  at december  the corporation held no such investments in or prior periods

the most significant components of the rate change in net interest income in were a decrease in interest income of  attributable to lower rates earned on taxable available for sale securities and a decrease in interest expense of  due to lower rates paid on interest bearing deposits

the corporation s yield on taxable securities fell in and primarily because of low market interest rates  including the effects of management s decision to limit purchases of taxable securities to investments that mature or are expected to repay a substantial portion of principal within approximately four years or less 
in addition to the impact of falling rates  the corporation s yield on taxable securities was also negatively affected in by higher than expected prepayments on mortgage backed securities  these prepayments were caused by procedural changes by the us government agencies that issued the securities 
the average rate of return on available for sale securities was for and in the average balance of gross loans decreased to  in from  in due to the challenging economic environment and the corporation s decision to sell a portion of its newly originated residential mortgages on the secondary market  the corporation experienced contraction in the balance of its mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  with modest growth in average commercial loan balances

other deposit account fees increased  in compared to  mainly due to fee pricing changes effective at the beginning of brokerage revenue of  in was  higher than in the increase in brokerage revenue includes the effects of sales of annuities to customers who had previously held variable rate individual retirement accounts deposits with the corporation 
changes in variable rate individual retirement account deposits are discussed in more detail in the net interest income section of management s discussion and analysis 
interchange revenue from debit card transactions of  in is  or  higher than in the increased level of interchange fees reflects customers higher volume of debit card transactions 
the federal reserve issued a final rule  effective october   which establishes maximum interchange rates that may be paid to large as defined financial institutions 
the maximum rates established under the rule are approximately lower than the average market rates paid to the corporation throughout the last several years 
although the rule s rate constraints do not directly apply to the corporation because the corporation is not considered a large financial institution for this purpose  management believes interchange revenues could be reduced either because of lower volumes or because market conditions may dictate that smaller financial institutions receive rates similar to large financial institutions 
management is monitoring regulatory and market conditions associated with interchange processing  but cannot reasonably estimate the timing or amount of future changes in interchange revenues that may occur 
net gains from the sale of loans totaled  in  an increase of  over in  management began to sell a significant amount of residential mortgage originations into the secondary market 
the corporation sells mortgage loans through the mpf xtra program administered by the federal home loan banks of pittsburgh and chicago 
the increased volume of mortgage loans sold reflects the impact of significant refinancing activity  with a new upsurge starting in the third quarter  triggered by falling long term market interest rates on mortgages 
the recent increase in volume is similar to the surge in refinancing activity the corporation experienced in the last several months of as described in the earnings overview section of management s discussion and analysis  in the third quarter  the corporation realized net gains from sales of premises and equipment totaling  including a gain of  from sale of the court street  williamsport  pa location

the leaseback is for use of approximately of the total building space  for a period of two years with monthly rent of approximately  per month  plus allocable utilities  property taxes and other building related expenses identified in the lease 
the lease provides the corporation with an option to renew for an additional two years  for monthly rent of approximately  per month  plus allocable building related expenses 
the corporation s continuing interest in the property is limited to its role as lessee  and the corporation did not provide financing to the buyer 
the corporation has accounted for the leaseback as an operating lease 
in  net gains from sales of premises and equipment totaled  including a gain of  from the sale of a parcel adjacent to the court street  williamsport location

such analysis showed the estimated return to the corporation would be sufficient to repay the loan in full  but would not provide sufficient additional cash flow for return on the limited partnership investment 
accordingly  management made the decision to completely write off the limited partnership investment 
other operating income of  in was  higher than in in  this category included income of  from a limited liability equity investment in an entity performing title insurance services throughout pennsylvania 
comparatively  the corporation recognized  of income from investment in this entity in the corporation has also experienced increases in revenues from check sales up  and merchant services up  in as compared to vs 
service charges on deposit accounts decreased  or in compared to overdraft fee revenues associated with an overdraft privilege program decreased  reflecting the initial impact of limitations imposed on such fees by federal legislation that requires all consumers to affirmatively opt in to the program

fdic assessments decreased  or in effective april   the fdic s method of determining assessments to banks has changed  with the new methodology resulting in higher assessments to larger  more complex or higher risk institutions  with smaller assessments to many community and small regional banks 
since the second quarter  the corporation s fdic assessments  determined using the new methodology  are substantially lower than the amounts assessed for the prior several quarters 
the favorable decline also reflects rate changes attributed to improvements in the corporation s risk profile based on financial ratios

also  equipment maintenance costs decreased  compared to fdic insurance costs decreased  to  in the fdic insurance costs reflect the impact of a  special assessment imposed by the fdic 
other operating expense decreased  or 
the category includes a variety of expenses  and the most significant increases and decreases of individual expenses are as follows bucktail life insurance company s operating expenses  primarily for estimated gaap policy reserves  were reduced by  compared to expenses related to foreclosed properties decreased in by  compared to  primarily from lower operating expenses associated with one large commercial property that was sold in the fourth quarter of amortization of core deposit intangibles decreased  professional fees associated with the overdraft privilege program decreased  in no stock option expense was incurred in under the independent directors stock incentive plan compared with costs of  in certain operating costs  which were substantially discretionary  were lower in advertising  certain public relations costs  and certain professional membership dues decreased  in income taxes the effective income tax rate was of pre tax income in compared to of pre tax income in in  the credit for income tax was of the pre tax loss

in  the corporation recorded a valuation reserve of  related to deferred tax assets  and in  the valuation reserve was eliminated  resulting in a benefit reduction in expense of  the corporation recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
at december   the net deferred tax asset was  down from the balance at december  of  and from the balance at december  of  some of the significant components of the net reduction in deferred tax asset at december  as compared to december  are as follows at december   the corporation had a deferred tax liability of  associated with net unrealized gains on available for sale securities 
in comparison  at december   there was a deferred tax asset of  associated with net unrealized losses on available for sale securities 
changes in unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  are excluded from the determination of earnings but are included in comprehensive income 
the net deferred tax asset balance at december  attributable to realized securities losses was  down from the balance at december  of  in  the corporation sold a pooled trust preferred security that had been written off in and for financial statement purposes  resulting in a book gain of  the loss for income tax purposes from this transaction is  with the large book tax difference representing the main reason for the reduction in the deferred tax asset 
the corporation has available an estimated  capital loss carryforward at december   expiring in at december   the corporation had an ordinary loss carryforward of  expiring in  and a capital loss carryforward of  expiring in the amount of deferred tax asset from unused loss carryforwards at december  of  is down from  at december   primarily as a result of taxable income generated in at december   the deferred tax asset based on the credit for alternative minimum tax amt paid was  up from  at december  the increase in reflects estimated amt payable for realization of the deferred tax asset for amt depends on generation of sufficient ordinary taxable income in excess of amt income in future years  though there is no expiration of the credit for amt paid under current tax law 
the corporation regularly reviews deferred tax assets for recoverability based on history of earnings  expectations for future earnings and expected timing of reversals of temporary differences 
realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income  including taxable income in prior carryback years  as well as future taxable income 
management believes the recorded net deferred tax asset at december  is fully realizable  however  if management determines the corporation will be unable to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset  the corporation would adjust the deferred tax asset  which would negatively impact earnings 
in the fourth quarter  the corporation sold some securities for which other than temporary impairment losses otti had been recognized for financial reporting purposes in and the first nine months of as a result of these sales  the corporation realized both ordinary and capital tax losses for  and filed net operating loss carryback returns resulting in tax refunds totaling  received in from recovery of some of the taxes previously paid for  and in late  the internal revenue service irs sent the corporation an information document request related to the corporation s federal return  as part of an evaluation to determine whether the return will be examined or accepted without examination 
in  the corporation received a final determination from the irs that the corporation s loss carryback returns of losses will not result in an irs examination 
in  the corporation sold additional securities for which otti had been previously recognized 
these sales resulted in tax losses for  and in the corporation filed net operating loss carryback returns to recover additional taxes previously paid

the total of loans outstanding without consideration of the allowance for loan losses reflects a total decrease of  from the balance at december  to the total outstanding of  at december  loan volumes are heavily dependent on economic conditions in the corporation s market area  and are significantly influenced by interest rates 
since the end of  the corporation experienced a net decrease in total loans outstanding under the residential mortgage segment  with more residential mortgage originations than in previous years sold into the secondary market 
in september  the corporation initiated participation in the mpf xtra program administered by the federal home loan banks of pittsburgh and chicago for the sale of mortgage loans to the secondary market 
at december   the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans originated by the corporation  and sold with servicing retained was  also  in the last four years  consumer loans have steadily decreased  to the december  balance of  total commercial segment loans increased  at december  as compared to december   though total commercial loans decreased  in from year end table viii presents loan maturity data as of october  the last date in for which the corporation ran the interest rate simulation model used to generate the loan maturity information included in table viii 
the interest rate simulation model classifies certain loans under different categories than they appear in table vii 
fixed rate loans are included in table viii based on their contractually scheduled principal repayments  while variable rate loans are included based on contractual principal repayments  with the remaining balance reflected in the table as of the date of the next change in rate 
table viii shows that fixed rate loans are approximately of the loan portfolio 
of the of the portfolio made up of variable rate loans  a significant portion will re price after more than one year 
variable rate loans re pricing after more than one year include significant amounts of residential and commercial real estate loans 
the corporation s substantial investment in long term  fixed rate loans and variable rate loans with extended periods until re pricing is one of the concerns management attempts to address through interest rate risk management practices

notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the process management uses for evaluating and determining the allowance for loan losses 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  changes in economic conditions may necessitate revisions in future years 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the corporation to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses of  at december  was down from  at december  as presented in table x  the specific component of the allowance on impaired loans decreased to  at december  from  at december  table x also shows that the collectively determined components of the allowance fell by a total of  as of december  compared to december   mainly because total outstanding loans decreased for each segment of the portfolio 
the average net charge off percentages and average qualitative factors used in determining the collectively evaluated components of the allowance did not change significantly at december  as compared to the december  analysis 
the decrease in the allowance on impaired loans at december  as compared to december  included the following significant transactions in  charge offs totaling   in the second quarter and an additional  in the fourth quarter were recorded related to a commercial relationship for which specific allowances totaling  had been established at december  after the impact of these charge offs and re evaluation of the allowances required  the corporation had loans outstanding totaling  with no specific allowance at december  related to this commercial borrower 
in  a charge off of  was recorded for a commercial relationship for which specific allowances totaling  had been established at december  after the impact of the charge off  there were no loans outstanding from this borrower 
at december   there was a balance in foreclosed assets held for sale of  based on the estimated fair value of real estate that had collateralized the loans 
in  the corporation was paid off in full on a commercial loan relationship for which an allowance of  had been established at december  table ix shows a credit for loan losses of  in  in comparison to a provision for loan losses of  in as shown in table xii  the average provision for loan losses for the five year period ended december  was  the total amount of the provision for loan losses for each period is determined based on the amount required to maintain an appropriate allowance in light of all of the factors described above 
in  the corporation s credit for loan losses included the effects of the following although there were significant changes in the specific allowance amounts required on some large commercial relationships described in the bullet points above  the net impact on the provision for loan losses of those changes was not significant  the total amount of loans newly identified as impaired and requiring specific allowances in was not significant  as reflected in table ix  recoveries of previously charged off loans were higher in than in the recent past  and the allowance amounts required on collectively evaluated loans fell due to a decrease in outstanding loans 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the credit provision for loan losses and activity in the allowance for loan losses  by segment and class  for table xi presents information related to past due and impaired loans  and loans that have been modified under terms that are considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs 
at december   total impaired loans were  down from  at december  the balance of impaired loans at december  included loans newly identified as impaired in totaling  resulting from implementation of new fasb guidance asu related to accounting for tdrs 
nonaccrual loans totaled  at december   down from  at december   and total loans past due days or more and still in accrual status increased to  at december  from  at december  interest continues to be accrued on loans days or more past due that management deems to be well secured and in the process of collection  and for which no loss is anticipated 
over the period  each period includes a few large commercial relationships that have required significant monitoring and workout efforts 
as a result  a limited number of relationships may significantly impact the total amount of allowance required on impaired loans  and may significantly impact the amount of total charge offs reported in any one period 
as shown in table xi  loans classified as tdrs increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase in tdrs reflects the impact of new asu accounting guidance  as modifications such as extensions of terms and maturities that would have not been considered tdrs in the past because the contractual interest rate had not been changed are now considered tdrs because the current un modified contractual rate would be considered less than a market rate for the applicable borrower 
management believes it has been conservative in its decisions concerning identification of impaired loans  estimates of loss  and nonaccrual status  however  the actual losses realized from these relationships could vary materially from the allowances calculated as of december  management continues to closely monitor its commercial loan relationships for possible credit losses  and will adjust its estimates of loss and decisions concerning nonaccrual status  if appropriate

liquidity liquidity is the ability to quickly raise cash at a reasonable cost 
an adequate liquidity position permits the corporation to pay creditors  compensate for unforeseen deposit fluctuations and fund unexpected loan demand 
at december   the corporation maintained overnight interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank of philadelphia and other correspondent banks totaling  the corporation maintains overnight borrowing facilities with several correspondent banks that provide a source of day to day liquidity

additionally  the corporation uses repurchase agreements placed with brokers to borrow funds secured by investment assets  and uses reposweep arrangements to borrow funds from commercial banking customers on an overnight basis 
if required to raise cash in an emergency situation  the corporation could sell available for sale securities to meet its obligations 
at december   the carrying value of available for sale securities in excess of amounts required to meet pledging or repurchase agreement obligations was  management believes the corporation is well positioned to meet its short term and long term obligations 
stockholders equity and capital adequacy the corporation and c n bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
details concerning regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as reflected in note  at december  and  the ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets  tier capital to risk weighted assets and tier capital to average total assets are well in excess of regulatory capital requirements 
in january  the corporation issued preferred stock and a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to the united states department of the treasury under the tarp program for an aggregate price of  the preferred stock paid a cumulative dividend rate of per annum 
on august   the corporation redeemed all of the preferred stock 
subsequently  the corporation negotiated with the treasury for repurchase of the warrant on september  for a total cash cost of  which was recorded as a reduction in paid in capital 
as a result  the corporation is no longer subject to the requirements and limitations of the tarp program 
in  the corporation issued approximately  shares of common stock  raising a total of  net of related offering costs 
of this total   shares were issued at a price of per share in a public offering that was completed in december  and which resulted in net proceeds of  included in the  for the year 
the additional  was raised through the issuance of shares under our dividend reinvestment plan 
although the corporation maintained capital ratios that exceeded regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized throughout  the additional capital provides flexibility to absorb any additional  unexpected securities losses or other economic issues that might arise 
further  the additional capital provided funding for repayment of the tarp preferred stock in  and improves the corporation s ability to respond to any opportunities that could arise for branch or full bank acquisitions 
future dividend payments will depend upon maintenance of a strong financial condition  future earnings and capital and regulatory requirements 
in addition  the corporation  and c n bank are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be paid without approval of banking regulatory authorities 
these restrictions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation s total stockholders equity is affected by fluctuations in the fair values of available for sale securities 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax  amounted to  at december  and  at december  changes in accumulated other comprehensive income are excluded from earnings and directly increase or decrease stockholders equity 
if available for sale securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  unrealized losses are recorded as a charge against earnings  and amortized cost for the affected securities is reduced 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information concerning management s evaluation of available for sale securities for other than temporary impairment at december  stockholders equity is also affected by the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans 
the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to underfunded defined benefit plans  net of deferred income tax  was  at december  and  at december  comprehensive income loss comprehensive income or loss is a measure of the change in equity of a corporation  excluding transactions with owners in their capacity as owners such as proceeds from issuances of stock and dividends 
the difference between net income and comprehensive income is termed other comprehensive income loss 
for the corporation  other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  net of deferred income tax 
the amount of unrealized gains or losses reflected in comprehensive income may vary widely from period to period  depending on the financial markets as a whole and how the portfolio of available for sale securities is affected by interest rate movements 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit plans is also included in other comprehensive income 
total comprehensive income was  in and  in  while in the total comprehensive loss was  other comprehensive income loss amounted to  in   in and  in as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  a new accounting standard asu no 
will change the financial statement presentation of comprehensive income  starting in the first quarter the intent of the new standard is to increase the prominence of comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the new standard requires the components of comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the single format would include the traditional income statement and the components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income 
in the two statement approach  the first statement would be the traditional income statement  which would be immediately followed by a separate statement which would include the components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income 
inflation the corporation is significantly affected by the federal reserve board s efforts to control inflation through changes in short term interest rates 
beginning in september  in response to concerns about weakness in the us economy  the federal reserve lowered the fed funds target rate numerous times  in december  it established a target range of to  which it has maintained throughout  and also  the federal reserve has injected massive amounts of liquidity into the nation s monetary system through a variety of programs 
the federal reserve has purchased large amounts of securities in an effort to keep interest rates low and stimulate economic growth 
despite the current low short term rate environment  liquidity injections  and commodity price increases  inflation statistics indicate that the overall rate of inflation is unlikely to significantly affect the corporation s operations within the near future 
although management cannot predict future changes in the rates of inflation  management monitors the impact of economic trends  including any indicators of inflationary pressures  in managing interest rate and other financial risks 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements and their recent or potential future effects on the corporation s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices of the corporation s financial instruments 
in addition to the effects of interest rates  the market prices of the corporation s debt securities within the available for sale securities portfolio are affected by fluctuations in the risk premiums amounts of spread over risk free rates demanded by investors 
management cannot control changes in market prices of securities based on fluctuations in the risk premiums demanded by investors  nor can management control the volume of deferrals or defaults by other entities on trust preferred securities 
however  management attempts to limit the risk that economic conditions would force the corporation to sell securities for realized losses by maintaining a strong capital position discussed in the stockholders equity and capital adequacy section of management s discussion and analysis and ample sources of liquidity discussed in the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis 
the corporation s two major categories of market risk are interest rate risk and equity securities risk  which are discussed in the following sections 
interest rate risk business risk arising from changes in interest rates is an inherent factor in operating a bank 
the corporation s assets are predominantly long term  fixed rate loans and debt securities 
funding for these assets comes principally from shorter term deposits and borrowed funds 
accordingly  there is an inherent risk of lower future earnings or decline in fair value of the corporation s financial instruments when interest rates change 
the corporation uses a simulation model to calculate the potential effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the market value of portfolio equity 
for purposes of these calculations  the market value of portfolio equity includes the fair values of financial instruments  such as securities  loans  deposits and borrowed funds  and the book values of nonfinancial assets and liabilities  such as premises and equipment and accrued expenses 
the model measures and projects potential changes in net interest income  and calculates the discounted present value of anticipated cash flows of financial instruments  assuming an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
management ordinarily runs a variety of scenarios within a range of plus or minus basis points of current rates 
the corporation s board of directors has established policy guidelines for acceptable levels of interest rate risk  based on an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates 
the policy limits acceptable fluctuations in net interest income from the baseline flat rates one year scenario and variances in the market value of portfolio equity from the baseline values based on current rates 
during the third quarter  the policy was reviewed and extended to provide limits at    and basis points from current rates 
previously  the policy provided limits at   and basis points 
table xv  which follows this discussion  is based on the results of calculations performed using the simulation model as of october  and the table shows that as of october   the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within the policy limits in all scenarios 
table xv shows the simulation model results for basis points at october   but policy limits at basis points were not yet in effect at the simulation date 
as of october   the changes in net interest income and changes in market value were within applicable policy limits in all scenarios except an immediate rate decrease of basis points  which management considers to be highly unrealistic 
after preparation of the october  modeling results presented in table xv  management engaged an outside consultant to study the corporation s non maturity deposits checking  savings  and money market accounts 
the consultant examined historical data provided by management to estimate the average life of each type of deposit account and the sensitivity of each type of account to changes in interest rates 
the results of the study indicated that the corporation s non maturity deposits had significantly longer average lives than previously estimated 
these updated estimates are included in the october  data presented and result in higher market values in all of the rate scenarios and in smaller percentage declines in value in rising rate scenarios 
the study also indicated that the corporation s interest rates on non maturity deposits were slightly more sensitive to market changes than had previously been assumed  which contributed to the larger declines in net interest income in rising rate scenarios based on october  data 
in december  the corporation entered into repurchase agreements borrowings totaling million to fund the purchase of investment securities 
the borrowings include embedded caps providing that  if month libor were to exceed  the interest rate payable on the repurchase agreements would fall  down to a minimum of  based on parameters included in the repurchase agreements 
three month libor was at october  and at october   and has not exceeded since the embedded caps were acquired 
the embedded cap on one of the million borrowings expired in december  and the embedded cap on the other million borrowing expires in december the model makes estimates  at each level of interest rate change  regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and call activity on other investment securities 
actual results could vary significantly from these estimates  which could result in significant differences in the calculations of projected changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
also  the model does not make estimates related to changes in the composition of the deposit portfolio that could occur due to rate competition  and the table does not necessarily reflect changes that management would make to realign the portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates

investments in bank stocks are subject to risk factors that affect the banking industry in general  including credit risk  competition from non bank entities  interest rate risk and other factors  which could result in a decline in market prices 
also  losses could occur in individual stocks held by the corporation because of specific circumstances related to each bank 
as discussed further in note of the consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized no otti charges on bank stocks in but did recognize otti charges on bank stocks totaling  in and  in equity securities held as of december  and are presented in table xvi
