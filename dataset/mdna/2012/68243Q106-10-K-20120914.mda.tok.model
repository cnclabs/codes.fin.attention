table of contents as a provider of gifts to consumers and wholesalers for resale to consumers  the company is subject to changes in consumer confidence and the economic conditions that impact our customers 
demand for the company s products is affected by the financial health of our customers  which is influenced by macro economic issues such as unemployment  fuel and energy costs  weakness in the housing market and unavailability of consumer credit 
during the recent economic downturn  the demand for our products  and accordingly our financial results  compared to pre recessionary levels  has been adversely affected by the reduction in consumer spending 
during fiscal the company continued to recover from the effects of the recession which began in fiscal  building on last year s improved financial performance 
as a result of cost reductions and productivity improvements  marketing efficiency and merchandising innovation  the company has been able to make significant annual improvements in ebitda compared to the low point of the recession during fiscal a key tenet of the company s strategy during this period was to stabilize the consumer floral operations and minimize business risk during the current recessionary period 
in order to improve earnings during this recessionary period  the company took a more conservative view of the economy  and its expectations of demand  in order to minimize the risk of investing marketing and operating spend for revenue growth too early in the economic recovery cycle 
this strategy was designed to protect earnings growth that was expected to be achieved through operational improvements and business resizing programs  including a rationalization of marketing spending  but driven by more effective campaigns  that focused on the company s ability to wow our customers with differentiated  non commoditized higher value products 
while the economic recovery continues at a slow pace  with the possibility of a double dip recession looming as a result of continued high un employment  energy and commodity prices  the company believes that its sales bottomed out in the first half of fiscal  as it then began to experience modest year over year revenue growth 
tempered by the continued economic uncertainty  during fiscal  the company expects to grow revenues across all three of its business segments with consolidated revenue growth for the year anticipated to be in the mid single digit range 
also  based on continued improvements in gross profit margin and operating leverage  the company anticipates achieving double digit year over year increases in ebitda and eps 
the company s fiscal guidance is based on the positive trends both top and bottom line that the company has seen over the past two years  balanced by the continued uncertainty in the global economy 
the company plans to continue to focus on managing those aspects of the business where it can drive growth and enhanced results  including merchandising and marketing initiatives featuring truly original products that have helped drive increased average order value and gross profit margins  efforts in manufacturing  sourcing and shipping that have helped absorb rising commodity and fuel costs and enhanced operating cost leverage  and investments in innovation for the future  including its industry leading efforts in social and mobile arenas  bloomnet and franchising programs in consumer floral and fannie may 
the company believes these efforts  and others underway  will help continue the positive trends seen in the business as the company deepens its relationships with its customers  helping them deliver smiles  and build shareholder value 
category information the following table presents the contribution of net revenues  gross profit and category contribution margin from each of the company s business segments  as well as consolidated ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
as noted previously  the company s wine fulfillment services business  which

in order to leverage the company s infrastructure  these functions are operated under a centralized management platform  providing support services throughout the organization 
the costs of these functions  other than those of the customer service center  which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage  are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific category 
performance is measured based on category contribution margin or category adjusted ebitda  reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the segment 
as such  management s measure of profitability for these segments does not include the effect of corporate overhead  described above  depreciation and amortization  other income net  nor does it include one time charges 
management utilizes ebitda  and adjusted financial information  as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization 
the company also uses ebitda and adjusted financial information as one of the factors used 
table of contents to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
the company s credit agreement uses ebitda and adjusted financial information to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
ebitda and adjusted financial information is also used by the company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
ebitda and adjusted financial information have limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  the company s working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on the company s debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with gaap results when evaluating the company s performance 
gourmet food gift baskets category contribution margin during the fiscal year ended july   includes a million gain on the sale of fannie may retail stores  which are currently being operated as franchised locations 
due to certain one time charges  the following non gaap reconciliation table has been included within md a

revenue recognition net revenues are generated by e commerce operations from the company s online and telephonic sales channels as well as other operations retail wholesale and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits

if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company performs an annual impairment test during its fiscal fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 

table of contents based on its impairment test  the company s reporting units had significant safety margins  representing the excess of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit less its respective carrying value including goodwill allocated to each respective reporting unit 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
stock based compensation the measurement of stock based compensation expense is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock price 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and future expectations 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the black scholes model also incorporates expected forfeiture rates  based on historical behavior 
determining these assumptions are subjective and complex  and therefore  a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of the company s stock options 
income taxes the company has established deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company has recognized as a deferred tax asset the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
realization of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
it is the company s policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
to the extent that the company prevails in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or is required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds and investment grade corporate and us government securities  as well as from outstanding debt 
as of july   the company s outstanding debt  including current maturities  approximated million 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes  but rather to hedge its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company manages its floating rate debt using interest rate swaps in order to reduce its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates on its consolidated results of operations and future cash outflows for interest 
in july  the company entered into a million notional amount swap agreement that exchanges a variable interest rate libor for a fixed rate of interest over the term of the agreement 
this swap matured on july  the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of the interest rate risk attributable to forecasted variable interest libor payments 
the effective portion of the after tax fair value gains or losses on this swap is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
exclusive of the impact of the company s interest rate swap agreement  each basis point change in interest rates would have had a corresponding effect on our interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis
