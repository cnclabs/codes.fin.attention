harvard bioscience  inc is referred to herein as we  our  us  and the company 
part i item business 
overview harvard bioscience  inc  a delaware corporation  is a global developer  manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of specialized products  primarily apparatus and scientific instruments which are used to advance life science research and regenerative medicine 
our products are sold to thousands of researchers in over countries primarily through our page catalog and various other specialty catalogs  our website  through distributors  including ge healthcare  thermo fisher scientific inc and vwr  and via our field sales organization 
we have sales and manufacturing operations in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  sweden and spain with additional facilities in france and canada 
our history our business began in under the name harvard apparatus and has grown over the years with the development and evolution of modern life science tools 
our early inventions included the mechanical syringe pump in the s for drug infusion and the microprocessor controlled syringe pump in the s 
in march  a group of investors led by our ceo and president acquired a majority of the then existing business of our predecessor  harvard apparatus 
following this acquisition  we redirected the focus of our company to participate in the higher growth areas  or bottlenecks  within life science research by acquiring and licensing innovative technologies while continuing to grow the existing business through internal product development and marketing  partnerships and acquisitions 
since march  we have completed business or product line acquisitions related to our continuing operations and internally developed many new product lines including new generation harvard apparatus syringe pumps  phd ultra series of syringe pumps  advanced 
table of contents inspira ventilators  genequant dna rna protein calculators  ultrospec spectrophotometers  our microliter spectrophotometer  d electrophoresis products  uvm plate readers and the btx mos well electroporation system 
recently we have developed novel devices to advance the emerging field of regenerative medicine 
we currently have three marketed products in this field  the inbreath hollow organ bioreactor  the lb solid organ bioreactor and the phd ultra nanomite stem cell therapy injection system 
these products are currently available for research use only unless use on humans is approved in accordance with hospital ethics committee protocols and local regulatory rules 
in july  we announced plans to divest our capital equipment business segment 
the decision to divest this business was based on the fact that market conditions for the capital equipment business segment had been such that this business did not meet our expectations and on our decision to focus our resources on the apparatus and instrumentation business segment 
as a result  we began reporting our capital equipment business segment as a discontinued operation in the third quarter of in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both part of our capital equipment business segment 
in september  we completed the sale of the assets of our union biometrica division including our german subsidiary  union biometrica gmbh  representing at that time the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment 
in addition to driving growth in our core research markets  we have been investing to create new products to address what we believe is a long term growth opportunity in the emerging field of regenerative medicine 
regenerative medicine is using stem cells to repair damaged organs and to grow organs outside the body for transplant 
the us department of health and human services has projected that the us market for regenerative medicine may be billion in the coming years 
the government s estimate appears to include the value of all regenerative medicine protocols and therapies  including potential cost savings versus current methodologies 
our strategy is not to become a therapeutics company but instead to provide tools to researchers and clinicians in the field of regenerative medicine 
these new tools currently fall into two main categories bioreactors for growing tissue and organs outside the body  and injectors for stem cell therapy 
these new tools we are creating are being built on our existing technologies such as our market leading harvard apparatus precision syringe pumps and market leading hugo sachs isolated organ systems 
our strategy in regenerative medicine is to create devices in collaboration with leading surgeons  not to discover pharmaceuticals  as creating devices like the inbreath bioreactor reduces risk compared to trying to discover new drugs  build these devices using our existing technologies and brands as this reduces the investment needed to get to market  and develop devices with significant disposable components as this is clinically safer and will also allow us to participate on a per procedure basis following the sale of an instrument 
our first regenerative medicine tool  the inbreath hollow organ bioreactor  was used to perform the world s first human transplant of a regenerated bronchus 
dr 
paolo macchiarini et al reported this success in the lancet  a leading general medicine journal  in november we have licensed this product from dr 
macchiarini s team  and worked to make it a commercial device 
we believe that it is the world s first commercially available bioreactor that has been used to perform a human transplant of a regenerated organ 
we believe it marks an important milestone in the development of the regenerative medicine field as the tools evolve from concepts to commercial quality products 
during the first half of  one of our collaborators  dr 
harald ott at massachusetts general hospital mgh succeeded in regenerating a lung and subsequently transplanting it into a rat 
in collaboration with dr 
ott and mgh  we designed and developed a novel bioreactor  the lb solid organ bioreactor  that was used to grow the lung 
the work was published online in nature medicine in july the bioreactor used by dr 
ott was a modified version of one of our market leading hugo sachs isolated organ systems 
in june  the inbreath bioreactor was used for the world s first successful transplantation of a synthetic tissue engineered windpipe 
for the first time in history  a patient was given a new trachea made from a synthetic scaffold seeded with his own stem cells in a bioreactor 
the cells were grown on the scaffold inside the bioreactor for two days before transplantation into the patient 
because the cells used to regenerate the trachea were the patient s own  there has been no rejection of the transplant  and the patient is not taking 
table of contents immunosuppressive drugs 
the patient had been suffering from late stage tracheal cancer  which before this surgery would have been inoperable  and is now alive and well eight months after the surgery 
the operation was performed at the karolinska university hospital in huddinge  stockholm  by dr 
paolo macchiarini of the karolinska university hospital and karolinska institutet  and colleagues 
dr 
macchiarini led an international team which included people who designed and built the nanocomposite tracheal scaffold  and we produced a specifically designed bioreactor used to seed the scaffold with the patient s own stem cells 
the success of this transplant surgery was published in the lancet on november  in november  a second patient was given a new trachea made from a synthetic scaffold seeded with his own stem cells in a bioreactor 
the patient had been suffering from late stage tracheal cancer 
the patient was discharged from the hospital in january on march   this patient died however the reason of his death has not yet been disclosed 
in addition to the bioreactors described above  we also have started the development of a clinical version of one of our market leading harvard apparatus research syringe pumps 
the research version of this pump is called the phd ultra nanomite stem cell therapy injection system 
we anticipate that this pump will be used to inject cells into damaged tissue in cell therapy 
we expect to submit this pump to the regulatory agencies in for approval 
our strategy our goal is to become a leading provider of tools for life science research and regenerative medicine 
we refer to these two segments as our core life science research tools division lsrt and our regenerative medicine device division rmd 
our lsrt strategy is to have a broad range of highly specialized but relatively inexpensive products that have strong positions in niche markets in life science research 
we believe that having a broad product offering reduces the risk of being dependent on a single technology  having relatively inexpensive products reduces the volatility associated with expensive capital equipment  and focusing on niche markets reduces head to head competition with the major instrument companies 
we seek to grow this range of products through a combination of organic growth driven by internal development of new products  direct marketing  distribution channel expansion and the acquisition of closely related products 
we use acquisitions to expand our product offerings because we believe we can use our well established brands and distribution channels to accelerate the growth of these acquired products 
we also believe that our expertise in operational management frequently allows us to improve profitability at acquired companies 
our rmd strategy is to leverage our existing technologies to provide tools to researchers and clinicians in the emerging field of regenerative medicine 
our products today  our broad lsrt product range is generally targeted towards two major application areas admet testing and molecular biology 
our rmd business is targeted towards two major application areas stem cell therapy injectors to repair damaged organs and bioreactors to grow organs outside the human body 
admet testing the goal of admet testing is to identify compounds that have toxic side effects or undesirable physiological or pharmacological properties 
these pharmacological properties consist of absorption  distribution  metabolism and elimination  which together with toxicology  form the acronym admet 
we have a wide range of products that our customers use to help their researchers conduct better experiments on cells  tissues  organs and animals 

table of contents we primarily sell these products under the harvard apparatus  btx  kd scientific  hugo sachs elektronik  panlab  coulbourn instruments  cma microdialysis and warner instruments brand names 
the individual sales prices of these products are mostly under  but when combined into systems such as the hugo sachs isolated organ system the total sales price can be over  we typically sell our admet products through our catalogs and website with support from technical specialists  although btx and kd scientific branded products are primarily sold through distributors 
some of these products are described below absorption diffusion chambers a diffusion chamber is a small plastic chamber with a membrane separating the two halves of the chamber used to measure the absorption of a drug into the bloodstream 
the membrane can either be tissue such as intestinal tissue or a cultured layer of cells such as human colon cells 
this creates a miniaturized model of intestinal absorption 
we manufacture and sell a wide range of tissue handling products under the warner instruments brand name 
distribution well equilibrium dialysis plate for serum protein binding assays our well equilibrium dialysis plate contains pairs of chambers with each pair separated by a membrane 
the protein target is placed on one side of the membrane and the drug on the other 
the small molecule drug diffuses through the membrane 
if it binds to the target  it cannot diffuse back again 
if it does not bind  it will diffuse back and forth until equilibrium is established 
once equilibrium is established  the concentration of the drug can be measured thereby indicating the strength of the binding 
this product is principally used for admet testing to determine if a drug binds to blood proteins 
a certain level of reversible binding is advantageous in order to promote good distribution of a drug through the human body 
however  if the binding is too strong  it may impair normal protein function and cause toxic effects 
these products are part of our sample preparation product line 
metabolism and elimination organ testing systems organ testing systems use glass or plastic chambers together with stimulators and recording electrodes to study organ function 
organ testing systems enable either whole organs or strips of tissue from organs such as hearts  livers and lungs to be kept functioning outside the body while researchers perform experiments with them 
this typically allows for multiple studies on a single donor animal 
studies on isolated livers are useful in determining metabolism and studies on kidneys are useful in determining elimination 
we have sold basic versions of these systems for many years  but significantly expanded our product offerings through our acquisitions of hugo sachs elektronik  panlab sl  and coulbourn instruments  llc 
toxicology precision infusion pumps and behavioral products infusion pumps  typically syringe pumps  are used to accurately infuse very small quantities of liquid  commonly drugs 
infusion pumps are generally used for long term toxicology testing of drugs by infusion into animals  usually laboratory rats 
we sell a wide range of different types of syringe pumps and many other products for infusing samples into and collecting samples from tissues  organs and animals 
we sell our syringe pumps primarily under our harvard apparatus and kd scientific brands 
we also design and manufacture behavioral products used in neuroscience  cardiology  psychological and respiratory studies to evaluate the effects of situational stimuli  drugs and nutritional infusions on motor and sensory  activity and learning and test behavior 
our behavioral product offerings are marketed under our panlab  coulbourn and cma microdialysis brands 
cell injection systems cell injection systems use extremely fine bore glass capillaries to penetrate and inject drugs into or around individual cells 
cell injection systems are used to study the effects of drugs on single cells 
injection is accomplished either with air pressure or  if the drug molecule is electrically charged  by applying an electric current 
we service the cell injection systems market primarily through our warner instruments brand 

table of contents ventilators ventilators use a piston driven air pump to inflate the lungs of an anesthetized animal 
ventilators are typically used in surgical procedures common in life science research and are part of our harvard apparatus product line 
in the late s we launched our advanced inspira ventilators  which have significant safety and ease of use features  such as default safety settings 
we further expanded our ventilator product line with the minivent acquired as part of our acquisition of hugo sachs elektronik in and expanded our presence in anesthesia with our acquisition of international market supply  ltd 
in electroporation products our btx brand includes our electroporation products of systems and generators  electrodes and accessories for research applications including in vivo  in ovo and in vitro gene delivery  electrocell fusion and nuclear transfer cloning 
through the application of precise pulsed electrical signals  electroporation systems open small pores in cell membranes allowing genes and or drugs to pass through the cell membranes 
the principal advantages of electroporation over other transfection techniques are speed  and that electroporation does not require chemicals that can interfere with or change cell function 
in  we launched our btx mos well electroporation system  which greatly increased the throughput of this otherwise essentially manual technique 
in december  we signed a license agreement with cellectis that grants us the worldwide exclusive right to manufacture and sell  for research use  the full line of cyto pulse electroporation based instruments 
distributed products in addition to our proprietary manufactured products  we sell through our catalogs many products that are made by other manufacturers 
distributed products accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  these distributed products enable us to provide our customers with a single source for their experimental needs 
these complementary products consist of a large variety of devices  instruments and consumable items used in experiments involving cells  tissues  organs and animals in the fields of proteomics  physiology  pharmacology  neuroscience  cell biology  molecular biology and toxicology 
we believe that many of our proprietary manufactured products are leaders in their fields  however  researchers often need complementary products in order to conduct particular experiments 
molecular biology we primarily sell these products through our distributors  including ge healthcare  under their brand names 
these products are mainly scientific instruments such as spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a wide range of molecular and cellular processes or apparatus such as gel electrophoresis units 
the instrumentation products are typically sold for prices ranging from  to  the apparatus products typically sell for less than we expanded our molecular biology product offerings with our september acquisition of denville scientific  inc denville  a distributor of molecular biology laboratory consumables  with a strong focus on liquid handling consumables utilized in research laboratories 
denville s field sales force sells these primarily denville branded products to end users in universities and other research laboratories 
this acquisition expanded our field sales capabilities and provided access to the us laboratory consumables market  which is currently estimated to be an approximately billion market 
molecular biology spectrophotometers a spectrophotometer is an instrument widely used in molecular biology and cell biology to quantify the amount of a compound in a sample by shining a beam of white light through a prism or grating to divide it into component wavelengths 
each wavelength in turn is shone through a liquid sample and the spectrophotometer measures the amount of light absorbed at each wavelength 
microliter spectrophotometry is a technique used to measure extremely small sample sizes 
we sell a wide range of spectrophotometers under the names ultrospec  novaspec  libra  biowave and lightwave 
our biochrom subsidiary manufactures these products  and we sell them primarily through our distribution arrangements with ge healthcare and other distributors 

table of contents dna rna protein calculators a dna rna protein calculator is a bench top instrument dedicated to quantifying the amount of dna  rna or protein in a sample 
it uses a process similar to that of a molecular biology spectrophotometer 
these are sold under the genequant name 
our biochrom subsidiary manufactures these products  and we primarily sell them through our distribution agreement with ge healthcare 
multi well plate readers multi well plate readers are widely used for high throughput screening assays in the drug discovery process 
the most common format is wells per plate 
plate readers use light to detect chemical interactions 
our product line includes absorbance readers and luminescence readers 
our biochrom subsidiary manufactures these products  and we sell them primarily through distributors under our asys hitech and anthos labtec brand names 
amino acid analysis systems an amino acid analysis system uses chromatography to separate the amino acids in a sample and then uses a chemical reaction to detect each one in turn as they flow out of the chromatography column 
amino acids are the building blocks of proteins 
in june  we acquired substantially all of the amino acid analysis systems business of the biotronik subsidiary of eppendorf netheler hinz gmbh and integrated it with the existing amino acid analysis systems business in our biochrom subsidiary 
we sell these systems  which are more expensive than most of our products  through biochrom s us direct sales force and through distributors internationally 
low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers a liquid dispenser dispenses low volumes  typically microliters  of liquids into high density microtitre plates used in high throughput screening processes in life science research 
our unique technology enables dispensing to take place without the need for contact between the droplet and the liquid already present in the plate  thereby removing any risk of cross contamination from the process 
we primarily market these products  and we sell them under distributor brand names as well as our own asys hitech name 
gel electrophoresis systems gel electrophoresis is a method for separating and purifying dna  rna and proteins 
in gel electrophoresis  an electric current is run through a thin slab of gel and the dna  rna or protein molecules separate out based on their charge and size 
the gel is contained in a plastic tank with an associated power supply 
we entered this market with the acquisition of scie plas ltd 
in november and greatly expanded our range of gel electrophoresis products with our november acquisition of hoefer  inc from ge healthcare 
approximately of hoefer revenues come from a distribution agreement with ge healthcare 
hoefer also markets its products through other distributors and through a catalog web distribution channel under the hoefer name 
we expanded our presence in this market with the acquisition of denville in september consumables our offering of molecular biology laboratory consumables with a liquid handling focus consists primarily of such products as pipettes  pipette tips  autoradiography film  gloves  thermal cycler accessories and reagents  which we sell through our field sales force in the us our denville scientific business services this market 
in february we purchased ahn biotechnologie gmbh 
ahn is a manufacturer of laboratory consumables 
our customers our end user customers are primarily research scientists at universities and government laboratories  including the us national institute of health  or nih and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our academic customers have included major colleges and universities such as baylor university  cambridge university  harvard university  johns hopkins university  massachusetts institute of technology  yale 
table of contents university and the university of texas md anderson center 
our pharmaceutical and biotechnological customers have included pharmaceutical companies and research laboratories such as amgen  inc  astrazeneca plc  genentech  inc and johnson johnson 
we conduct direct sales in the united states  the united kingdom  germany  france  spain  sweden and canada 
we sell primarily through distributors in other countries 
aggregate sales to our largest customer  ge healthcare  a distributor with end users similar to ours  accounted for approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  compared to of our revenues for the year ended december  the decrease was due to ge healthcare s acceleration of orders of our nanovue microvolume spectrophotometer product during to secure an exclusive right to that product s technology 
as a result  ge heathcare ordered the nanovue product at rates below their sell through rates as they reduced their inventory for most of we have several thousand customers worldwide and no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues for such periods 
our september acquisition of denville expanded our us field sales capabilities and provided direct access to the laboratory consumables market 
sales and marketing for the year ended december   revenues from direct sales to end users represented approximately of our revenues  and revenues from sales of our products through distributors represented approximately of our revenues 
direct sales we periodically produce and mail a harvard apparatus full line catalog  which contains approximately  products on pages and is printed in varying quantities ranging from  to  copies 
the latest catalog  which is accessible on our website  serves as the primary sales tool for the harvard apparatus product line  which includes both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers 
our reputation as a leading producer in many of our manufactured products creates traffic to the catalog and website  enables cross selling and facilitates the introduction of new products 
in addition to the comprehensive catalog  we create and mail abridged catalogs that focus on specific product areas along with direct mailers and targeted e mailers  which introduce or promote new products 
we distribute the majority of our catalog products through our worldwide subsidiaries 
we have field sales forces in several of our lsrt markets  where our sales people visit our customers laboratories each day 
we have field sales teams in the united states  canada  the united kingdom  germany  france and spain 
in those regions where we do not have a subsidiary  or for products which we have acquired that had distributors in place at the time of our acquisition  we use distributors 
distributors ge healthcare is our largest distributor  accounting for  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historically  ge healthcare has been our primary distributor  marketer and seller of a significant portion of our spectrophotometer and dna rna calculator product lines of our biochrom subsidiary 
in april  our biochrom subsidiary entered into a new distribution agreement with ge healthcare 
under the terms of the agreement  ge healthcare serves as the exclusive  worldwide except canada distributor  marketer and seller of a significant portion of the spectrophotometer and dna rna calculator product lines sold by biochrom  including the microliter spectrophotomer to which ge healthcare has exclusive access on a worldwide basis including canada 
ge healthcare made sufficient purchases during to earn exclusivity to the technology used in our nanovue microvolume spectrophotometer product 
ge healthcare had a contractual right to earn such exclusivity for the term of its distribution agreement by purchasing a specified minimum quantity of that product in 
table of contents ge healthcare did not have any contractual minimum purchase obligation in and beyond for that product 
as a result  ge heathcare ordered the nanovue product at rates below their sell through rates as they reduced inventory for most of and consequently sales of this product to them were significantly lower in than in this product accounted for approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the term of the agreement expires december  it may be terminated by either party upon one year advance written notice and may be extended by ge healthcare for additional one year periods 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement by either party  the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 
in november  in connection with the acquisition of hoefer from ge healthcare  we entered into a separate distribution agreement with ge healthcare for the distribution of the hoefer products 
this contract had a five year term with an automatic five year renewal period  provides for minimum purchases for the first three years  allows us to use the hoefer name which we acquired in the transaction on direct sales by us to end users or through other distributors  and may be terminated after five years with a one year advance notice upon certain circumstances 
additionally  upon breach of certain terms of the agreement  such as pricing  exclusivity and delivery  by either party  the agreement may be terminated with a day notice period 
in addition to engaging ge healthcare as the primary distributor for our biochrom and hoefer products  we also engage distributors for the sales of harvard apparatus  warner  btx  kd scientific  asys hitech  anthos  panlab  coulbourn  cma and scieplas branded products in certain areas of the world and for certain product lines 
backlog our order backlog was approximately million each as of december  and we include in backlog only those orders for which we have received valid purchase orders 
purchase orders may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment 
our backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
we typically ship our backlog at any given time within days 
research and development our principal research and development mission in our lsrt division is to develop products that address growth opportunities within the life science research process  particularly for application in the areas of admet testing and molecular biology and liquid handling 
through our rmd division  we are also working to develop new products aimed at long term opportunities in the emerging field of regenerative medicine 
our research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses during was primarily due to increased spending in our regenerative medicine initiative through our rmd division 
this increase was partially offset by reduced spending in our harvard apparatus and biochrom businesses 
we anticipate that we will continue to make investments in research and development activities as we deem appropriate given the circumstances at such time 
we plan to continue to pursue a balanced development portfolio strategy of originating new products from internal research and collaborations  and acquiring products through business and technology acquisitions 
we maintain development staff in most of our manufacturing facilities to design and develop new products and to re engineer existing products to bring them to the next generation level 
our in house development is focused on our current technologies 
manufacturing we manufacture and test the majority of our products in our principal manufacturing facilities located in the united states  the united kingdom  sweden  spain and germany 
we have considerable manufacturing flexibility at our various facilities  and each facility can manufacture multiple products at the same time 
we 
table of contents maintain in house manufacturing expertise  technologies and resources 
we seek to maintain multiple suppliers for key components that are not manufactured in house  and while some of our products are dependent on sole source suppliers  we do not believe our dependence upon these suppliers creates any significant risks 
our manufacturing operations primarily involve assembly and testing activities 
we manufacture syringe pumps  ventilators  cell injectors  molecular sample preparation products and electroporation products in holliston  massachusetts 
the manufacture of our cell biology and electrophysiology products takes place in both our holliston  massachusetts facility and our hamden  connecticut facility 
we manufacture spectrophotometers  amino acid analysis systems  low volume  high throughput liquid dispensers and our plate readers in our cambridge  england facility 
we manufacture our surgery and anesthesia related products and physiology teaching products in our edenbridge  england facility 
we manufacture our complete organ testing systems and bioreactors in march hugstetten  germany 
our electrophoresis products are manufactured at our richmond  california facility 
behavioral science products are manufactured in our barcelona  spain and whitehall  pennsylvania facilities 
our microdialysis products are manufactured at our holliston  massachusetts and solna  sweden facilities 
competition the markets into which we sell our products are highly competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition to continue or increase 
we compete with many companies engaged in developing and selling tools for life science research and regenerative medicine 
many of our competitors have greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources  and more experience in research and development and commercialization than we have 
moreover  our competitors may have greater name recognition than we do  and many offer discounts as a competitive tactic 
these competitors and other companies may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that compete with our products  which could render our products obsolete 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the enhancements to our technologies necessary to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
we are not aware of any significant products sold by us as being currently obsolete 
we believe that we offer one of the broadest selections of products to organizations engaged in life science research and regenerative medicine 
we are not aware of any competitor that offers a product line of comparable breadth across our target markets 
we have numerous competitors on a product line basis 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of product performance  including quality  reliability and speed  technical support  price and delivery time 
we compete with several companies that provide instruments for admet testing and molecular biology 
in the admet testing area  we compete with  among others  amaxa gmbh  becton  dickinson and company  eppendorf ag  kent scientific corporation  razel scientific instruments  inc and ugo basile 
in the molecular biology products area  we compete with  among others  danaher corporation  bio rad laboratories  inc  eppendorf ag  life technologies corporation  mds analytical technologies  perkinelmer  inc and thermo fisher scientific inc seasonality our business is generally not seasonal  however  sales and earnings in our third quarter are usually flat or down from the second quarter primarily because there are a large number of holidays and vacations during such quarter  especially in europe 
our fourth quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in any fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many of our customers tend to spend budgeted money before their own fiscal year ends 
intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products  we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts 
patents or patent applications cover certain of our new technologies 
most of our more mature product lines are protected by trade names and trade secrets only 

table of contents we have implemented a patent strategy designed to provide us with freedom to operate and facilitate commercialization of our current and future products 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we develop new products and technologies 
in  we filed two major patents in the field of regenerative medicine  the first covering claims for our stem cell therapy injectors and the second for claims for bioreactors for organ growth 
patents provide some degree of protection for our intellectual property 
however  the assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain 
the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection 
in addition  our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged  invalidated  circumvented or unenforceable so that our patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may protect our proprietary rights to a greater or lesser extent than the laws of the united states 
in addition  the laws governing patentability and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve  particularly in areas of interest to us 
as a result  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us 
as a result of these factors  our intellectual property positions bear some degree of uncertainty 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
although many of our us employees have signed agreements not to compete unfairly with us during their employment and after termination of their employment  through the misuse of confidential information  soliciting employees  soliciting customers and the like  the enforceability of these provisions varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and  in some circumstances  they may not be enforceable 
in addition  it is possible that these agreements may be breached or invalidated and if so  there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available 
despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that third parties will not independently discover or invent competing technologies  or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technologies 
therefore  the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we do not believe that our products infringe on the intellectual property rights of any third party 
we cannot assure you  however  that third parties will not claim such infringement by us or our licensors with respect to current or future products 
we expect that product developers in our market will increasingly be subject to such claims as the number of products and competitors in our market segment grows and the product functionality in different market segments overlaps 
in addition  patents on production and business methods are becoming more common and we expect that more patents will be issued in our technical field 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
moreover  such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be on terms advantageous to us  or acceptable at all  which could seriously harm our business or financial condition 
harvard is a registered trademark of harvard university 
the marks harvard apparatus and harvard bioscience are being used pursuant to a license agreement entered into in december between us and harvard university 
government regulation we are not subject to direct governmental regulation other than the laws and regulations generally applicable to businesses in the domestic and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
in particular  our current lsrt products are not subject to pre market approval by the united states food and drug administration fda for use on human clinical patients 
as we continue to develop new products for regenerative medicine applications in our rmd division  we expect that we will seek approvals from the fda for certain such products for use in clinical applications 
we expect the first such application to be for a clinical syringe pump which will 
table of contents be the platform for cell injector products 
we plan to file applications with the fda and other regulatory agencies for the clinical syringe pump in in addition  we believe we are currently in compliance with all relevant environmental laws 
employees as of december   we employed employees  of which are full time and are part time 
geographical residence information for these employees is summarized in the table below as of december  united states united kingdom spain germany sweden canada france total discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of the assets of our genomic solutions division and the stock of our belgian subsidiary  maia scientific  both of which were part of our capital equipment business segment  to digilab  inc as at december   digilab had delivered promissory notes of million 
the unpaid principal balance of the promissory notes bear an interest of libor plus basis points per annum 
to date we have recorded valuation allowances for of the earn out promissory notes as we have deemed their collectability as being uncertain 
in september  we completed the sale of assets of our union biometrica division including our german subsidiary  union biometrica gmbh  representing at that time the remaining portion of our capital equipment business segment  to ubio acquisition company 
the purchase price paid by ubio acquisition company under the terms of the asset purchase agreement consisted of in cash  the assumption of certain liabilities  plus additional consideration in the form of an earn out based on the revenue generated by the acquired business as it is conducted by ubio acquisition company over a five year post transaction period in an amount equal to i of the revenue generated up to and including million each year and ii of the revenue generated above million each year 
any earn out amounts will be evidenced by interest bearing promissory notes due on september  or at an earlier date based on certain triggering events 
we regularly monitor the financial performance of the ubio acquisition company to determine their ability to pay the earn out amounts when they become due on september  as at december   ubio acquisition company had delivered promissory notes of million 
the unpaid principal balance of the promissory notes bear an interest of per annum 
to date we have recorded valuation allowances for of the earn out promissory notes as we have deemed their collectability as being uncertain 
going forward  we will continue to monitor the financial performance of ubio acquisition company and digilab and recognize any contingent consideration in discontinued operations when and if realization of earn out amounts is deemed to be likely 
during  we recorded a gain of million in our discontinued operations reflecting an adjustment of our estimated net costs associated with the divestiture of our union biometrica division

item a 
risk factors 
as previously discussed  our actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements 
our business faces a variety of risks 
these risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business operations  performance and financial condition could be adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on form k 
the current soft economic environment and continued uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business 
the global financial crisis that began in caused disruption in the financial markets  including somewhat diminished liquidity and credit availability 
we are unable to predict the strength and duration of an economic recovery 
while these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets to date  there can be no assurance that these conditions will not adversely affect our ability to do so in the future  particularly if there is further deterioration in the world financial markets and major economies 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
continued concerns about credit markets  consumer confidence  economic conditions  volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could continue to negatively impact demand for our products 
if economic growth in the us and other countries continues to be slow and does not improve  customers may delay purchases of our products 
the tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing  which could result in a decrease in  or deferrals or cancellations of  the sale of our products 
if global economic and market conditions  or economic conditions in the united states  remain uncertain or persist  spread  or deteriorate further  we may experience a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
unstable economic  political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers  our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions persist  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we cannot project the extent of the impact of the economic environment on our industry or us 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the timing of purchases by customers and the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our quarterly revenues will likely be affected by various factors  including the seasonal nature of purchasing in europe 
our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the timing of catalog mailings and new product introductions  the release of grant and budget funding  future acquisitions and our substantial sales to european customers  who in summer months often defer purchases 
in particular  delays or reduction in purchase orders from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could have a material adverse effect on us and could adversely affect our stock price 
the failure of any banking institution in which we deposit our funds or the failure of such banking institution to provide services in the current economic environment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or access to borrowings 
we deposit our cash and cash equivalents with a number of financial institutions around the world 
should some or all of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services  we would likely have a limited ability to quickly access our cash deposited with such institutions 
if we are unable to 
table of contents quickly access such funds  we may need to increase our use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit  if available 
if we are unable to access some or all of our cash on deposit  either temporarily or permanently  or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit  it could have a negative impact on our operations  including our reported net income  our financial position  or both 
if we engage in any acquisition  we will incur a variety of costs  and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
our business strategy includes the future acquisition of businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business 
if we undertake any acquisition  the process of integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all 
future acquisitions could reduce stockholders ownership  cause us to incur debt  expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives 
we may also incur significant expenditures in anticipation of an acquisition that is never realized 
we may not realize the expected benefits from acquisitions due to difficulties integrating the businesses  operations and product lines 
our ability to achieve the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on the integration and leveraging of technology  operations  sales and marketing channels and personnel 
the integration process is a complex  time consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner 
we may have difficulty successfully integrating the acquired businesses  the domestic and foreign operations or the product lines  and as a result  we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions 
recently  we completed the acquisition of coulbourn instruments in august and cma microdialysis in july we cannot assure that our growth rate will equal the growth rates that have been experienced by us and the acquired companies  respectively  operating as separate companies in the past 
we have been actively engaged in acquiring and divesting companies 
as a result  we may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquiring company s stockholders  an acquired company s previous stockholders  a divested company s stockholders or our current stockholders 
we may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquiring company s stockholders  an acquired company s previous stockholders  a divested company s stockholders or our current stockholders 
such lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition or divestiture target prior to the date of the acquisition or divestiture  from the acquisition or divestiture transaction itself or from actions after the acquisition or divestiture 
defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management s attention from the operation of the business 
additionally  these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets 
attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future 
we will consider the acquisition of other businesses 
however  we may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future  which could negatively impact the growth of our business 
in order to pursue such opportunities  we may require significant additional financing  which may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
we expect that our competitors  many of which have significantly greater resources than we do  will compete with us to acquire compatible businesses 
this competition could increase prices for acquisitions that we would likely pursue 
if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be 
table of contents recoverable 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization  future cash flows  and slower growth rates in our industry 
we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets may have a material adverse effect on us 
we assess the recoverability of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and other long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asu  property  plant and equipment 
in accordance with fasb asu  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions are evaluated annually  or more frequently  if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment  to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
if it is determined in the future that a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets is impaired  we will be required to write off that portion of the asset according to the methods defined by fasb asu and fasb asu  which could have an adverse effect on net income for the period in which the write off occurs 
at december   our continuing operations had goodwill and intangible assets of million  or  of our total assets 
we concluded that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired 
future changes in financial accounting standards may adversely affect our reported results of operations 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles 
new accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future 
a change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
these new accounting pronouncements may adversely affect our reported financial results 
if our accounting estimates are not correct  our financial results could be adversely affected 
management judgment and estimates are required in the application of our critical accounting policies 
we discuss these estimates in the subsection entitled critical accounting policies beginning on page in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
if our estimates are incorrect  our future financial operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our business is subject to economic  political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations 
since we manufacture and sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
our revenues from our non us operations represented approximately of total revenues for we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
in addition  a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
the recent global economic slowdown has and could continue to have a negative effect on various foreign markets in which we operate 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including the impact of recessions and other economic conditions in economies  including europe in particular  outside the united states  disruptions of capital and trading markets  
table of contents inability to collect accounts receivable  limitations on repatriations of funds  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting the ability to or cost of repatriating profits  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  unfavorable labor regulations applicable to european operations  such as severance and the unenforceability of non competition agreements in the european union  other factors beyond our control  including terrorism  political unrest  acts of war  natural disasters and diseases  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  and interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers 
currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a negative impact on our reported earnings 
we are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign exchange rates  which could have a materially adverse effect on the sales price of our products in foreign markets  as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries 
approximately of our business during was conducted in functional currencies other than the us dollar  which is our reporting currency 
as a result  currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses 
generally  we have not used forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposures 
however  in order to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  in we used derivative financial instruments or foreign currency contracts to hedge the foreign currency effects on the value of certain loans between subsidiaries and did not designate these derivative instruments as accounting hedges 
currently  we attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities 
in the future  we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through additional hedging methods  including foreign currency contracts 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
if we are not able to manage our growth  our operating profits or losses may be adversely impacted 
our success will depend on the expansion of our operations through both organic growth and acquisitions 
effective growth management will place increased demands on our management team  operational and financial resources and expertise 
to manage growth  we must expand our facilities  augment our operational  financial and management systems  and hire and train additional qualified personnel 
failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenue or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenue  resulting in operating losses or reduced profitability 
we may incur additional restructuring costs or not realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses 
during the quarter ended march   we initiated a plan to relocate the scie plas operation to hoefer s san francisco  california facility and exit the general fabrication business as part of our ongoing business improvement initiative 
during the quarter ended september   we developed a plan to streamline our operations at panlab  our harvard apparatus business in spain 
the plan included workforce reduction in all functions of the organization and was carried out during that quarter 
during the quarter ended december   we developed a plan to reduce operating expenses at our biochrom uk subsidiary 
the plan included workforce reduction in all functions of the organization  inventory impairment charges and other charges and was carried out during that quarter 

table of contents during the quarter ended september   we initiated a plan to relocate our hoefer subsidiary s san francisco  california facility as part of a business improvement initiative 
we also developed a plan to improve operating margins at our coulbourn instruments subsidiary 
we may incur additional restructuring costs and we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits of these initiatives 
see note to our consolidated financial statements restructuring and other exit costs 
if we fail to retain key personnel and hire  train and retain qualified employees  we may not be able to compete effectively  which could result in reduced revenue or increased costs 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management  technical and scientific personnel 
our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time upon short notice 
the loss of the services of any member of the senior management team  including the chief executive officer  chane graziano  the president  david green  the chief operating officer  susan luscinski  the chief financial officer  thomas mcnaughton  or any of the managerial  technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
we operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive  including boston  massachusetts  the new york metropolitan area  london and cambridge  england  where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high 
as a result  competition for qualified personnel is intense  particularly in the areas of general management  finance  information technology  engineering and science  and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive  and may become more expensive in the future 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced 
we may be unsuccessful in developing new products for existing markets 
our strategy includes developing new products to drive organic growth in our businesses 
we may be unsuccessful developing new products that will be well received in existing markets 
the products we develop may have less market demand than we anticipate or the demand may be at substantially lower prices than we anticipate 
our competitors may develop new products or technologies that diminish demand for our new products 
our customers may receive decreased funding levels  which may cause their demand for our products to decrease 
our efforts to develop new intellectual property and new products may be costly 
failure in our new product development program could have a material impact on our results of operation and our financial condition 
we may be unsuccessful in launching new products or expanding product offerings in the field of regenerative medicine 
we announced the launch of our inbreath bioreactor  which was our first product in the field of regenerative medicine 
since that time  we have developed additional bioreactor products and we intend to expand our portfolio of bioreactors in the field of regenerative medicine 
in addition to developing bioreactors  we are also developing a stem cell therapy injector based on our market leading harvard apparatus research syringe pump technology 
we expect to submit this injector to the united states food and drug administration fda in for approval for clinical use on patients 
we intend to develop a series of products to address what we believe is a long term growth opportunity in the field of regenerative medicine 
although we believe the field of regenerative medicine presents long term opportunities for us  we may be unsuccessful in identifying and pursuing such opportunities 
we may be unsuccessful in introducing new products in the field of regenerative medicine  expanding current product offerings and commercializing existing or new technologies 
in addition  there may be a lack of demand in the present or in the future for the products that we introduce in the field of regenerative medicine 
we may be required to obtain regulatory approvals  including fda approvals  for our products in the field of regenerative medicine and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain such approvals on a timely basis or at all 

table of contents the current size and the anticipated size of the regenerative medicine market may be smaller than what we currently believe 
in addition  the existence and size of the opportunities that we believe currently are  or may in the future be  available to us may not exist or develop 
we may experience competition from many competitors  some of whom may have greater resources or better products or technologies than we do 
our customers may experience decreased demand for our products and research funding levels from endowments at our university customers may decrease 
finally  we will need to acquire  develop and protect our intellectual property  which may involve significant costs  and operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others 
any failure in our pursuit of opportunities in the field of regenerative medicine could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products 
we expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development stage companies that continually enter the market 
we anticipate that these competitors will include companies developing and marketing life sciences research tools  health care companies that manufacture laboratory based tests and analyzers  diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies  analytical instrument companies  companies developing life science or drug discovery technologies  and companies developing regenerative medicine technologies 
currently  our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products 
our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  operational  marketing and technical resources than we do 
moreover  these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts  and may have greater name recognition 
in addition  we may face competition from new entrants into the field 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
our products compete in markets that are subject to technological change  and therefore one or more of our products could be made obsolete by new technologies 
because the market for life science tools is characterized by technological change and frequent new product introductions  our product lines may be made obsolete unless we are able to continually improve existing products and develop new products 
to meet the evolving needs of customers  we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products 
however  we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements 
in addition  our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace 
we may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve 
our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology  market demands or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline  and we could experience significant losses 
we offer and plan to offer a broad product line and have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for development of new products and enhanced versions of our existing products 
the speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs 
failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses 

table of contents rising commodity and precious metals costs could adversely impact our profitability 
raw material commodities such as resins  and precious metal commodities such as platinum are subject to wide price variations 
increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy  transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution 
our million credit facility contains certain financial and negative covenants  the breach of which may adversely affect our financial condition 
we have a million revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america  as agent  and bank of america and brown brothers harriman co as lenders 
as of december  and  we had borrowings of million and million  respectively  under the credit facility 
the credit facility includes covenants relating to income  debt coverage and cash flow and minimum working capital requirements 
the credit facility also contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires lender approval for acquisitions funded with cash  promissory notes and or other consideration in excess of million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of million 
if we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants  in addition to other actions the creditor may require  the amounts drawn on the million facility may become immediately due and payable 
this immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition 
failure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to implement our acquisition strategy  finance the development of our regenerative medicine device business  expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in lower revenue 
we anticipate that our financial resources  which include available cash  cash generated from operations  and debt and equity capacity  will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for at least twelve months 
however  this expectation is premised on the current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors  including market acceptance of new products and future opportunities with collaborators 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis if at all could seriously harm our business  product development  development of our regenerative medicine device business and acquisition efforts 
if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity linked securities  existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced 
in addition  these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock 
we may issue securities that have rights  preferences and privileges senior to our common stock 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products  or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable 
in addition  our revolving credit loan agreement with bank of america  as agent  and bank of america and brown brothers harriman co as lenders  contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires lender approval for acquisitions funded with cash  promissory notes and or other consideration in excess of million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of million 
if future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to alter our operations or change our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that the capital required to fund operations or our acquisition strategy will be available in the future 
if ge healthcare formerly amersham biosciences terminates its distribution agreements with us  fails to renew such agreements on favorable terms or fails to perform its obligations under the distribution agreements  it could impair the marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products and result in lost revenues 
we have distribution agreements with ge healthcare in two of our businesses 
we believe our relationship with ge healthcare is good 
however  we cannot guarantee that the distribution agreements will be renewed  that 
table of contents ge healthcare will aggressively market our products in the future or that ge healthcare will continue the partnership 
if any of these events occurs  our marketing and distribution efforts for some of our products may be impaired and our revenues may be adversely impacted 
for  approximately of the company s revenues were generated through our two distribution agreements with ge healthcare 
in april  our biochrom subsidiary entered into a new distribution agreement with ge healthcare 
the second distribution agreement  between hoefer  inc  our subsidiary  and ge healthcare was entered into in november we have little or no control over ge healthcare s marketing and sales activities or the use of its resources 
ge healthcare may fail to purchase sufficient quantities of products from us or perform appropriate marketing and sales activities 
the failure by ge healthcare to perform these activities could materially adversely affect our business and growth prospects 
in addition  following any termination of such agreements  our inability to enter into new agreements with ge healthcare for product distribution could materially impede the growth of our business and our ability to generate sufficient revenue 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  third parties may use our technology  which would impair our ability to compete in our markets 
our continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for certain of our products throughout the world 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain 
we also own numerous us registered trademarks and trade names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending 
we rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position 
however  our presently pending or future patent applications may not be accepted and patents might not be issued  and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
furthermore  the claims in patents which have been issued or which may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
if we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology  our ability to be commercially competitive could be materially impaired 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship 
however  we may not be able to obtain these agreements in all circumstances in part due to local regulations 
in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
in addition  adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information 
the loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
the manufacture  sale and use of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products  services or product candidates  including without limitation  any of our life science research tools or our inbreath bioreactors or syringe pumps utilized now or in the future in relation to our regenerative medical device division  are alleged or found to have caused injury  damage or loss 
we may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain 
if we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage  then our business could be adversely impacted 

table of contents if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the united states food and drug administration and other governmental agencies  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the united states and other countries 
if we fail to comply with those regulations  we could be subject to fines  penalties  criminal prosecution or other sanctions 
some of the products we produce are subject to regulation by the united states food and drug administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies 
these regulations govern a wide variety of product activities  from design and development to labeling  manufacturing  promotion  sales  resales and distribution 
if we fail to comply with those regulations or those of similar foreign and domestic agencies  we may have to recall products  cease their manufacture and distribution  and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution 
our merger with genomic solutions may fail to qualify as a reorganization for federal income tax purposes  resulting in the recognition of taxable gain or loss in respect of our treatment of the merger as a taxable sale 
both we and genomic solutions intended the merger to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section a of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
although the internal revenue service  or irs  has not provided a ruling on the matter  genomic solutions obtained a legal opinion from its tax counsel that the merger constitutes a non taxable reorganization for federal income tax purposes 
this opinion does not bind the irs or prevent the irs from adopting a contrary position 
if the merger fails to qualify as a non taxable reorganization  the merger would be treated as a deemed taxable sale of assets by genomic solutions for an amount equal to the merger consideration received by genomic solutions stockholders plus any liabilities assumed by us 
as successor to genomic solutions  we would be liable for any tax incurred by genomic solutions as a result of this deemed asset sale 
if we were to be liable for any such tax  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time consuming 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions 
several of our products are based on patents that are closely surrounded by patents held by competitors or potential competitors 
as a result  we believe there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our patents were not closely surrounded by other patents 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
we may not prevail in any of these suits should they occur 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of being rejected and no patents being issued 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
for example  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative  which could cause the market price of our stock to decline 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  including the patent rights  trademarks and trade names of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is costly and the outcome is uncertain 
if we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  we 
table of contents could be required to stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question 
if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms  or are unable to design around any third party patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products and services  which could result in reduced revenue 
many of our current and potential customers are from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be one of our major sources of revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  such as pricing pressures as third party payers continue challenging the pricing of medical products and services  government regulation  ongoing consolidation and uncertainty of technological change  and to reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries 
in particular  the biotechnology industry is largely dependent on raising capital to fund its operations 
if biotechnology companies that are our customers are unable to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our products  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
as it relates to both the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  many companies have significant patents that have expired or are about to expire  which could result in reduced revenues for those companies 
if pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that are our customers suffer reduced revenues as a result of these patent expirations  they may be unable to purchase our products  and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are dependent  both directly and indirectly  upon general health care spending patterns  particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  as well as upon the financial condition and purchasing patterns of various governments and government agencies 
many of our customers  including universities  government research laboratories  private foundations and other institutions  obtain funding for the purchase of products from grants by governments or government agencies 
a potential decrease in the level of governmental spending allocated to scientific and medical research could substantially reduce or even eliminate these grants 
if government funding necessary to purchase our products were to decrease  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
customer  vendor and employee uncertainty about the effects of any of our acquisitions could harm us 
we and the customers of any companies we acquire may  in response to the consummation of the acquisitions  delay or defer purchasing decisions 
any delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by customers could adversely affect our business 
similarly  employees of acquired companies may experience uncertainty about their future role until or after we execute our strategies with regard to employees of acquired companies 
this may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel following an acquisition 
ethical concerns surrounding the use of our products and misunderstanding of the nature of our business could adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our existing products and new products 
some of our products may be used in areas of research involving cloning  stem cells  human tissue and organ transplants  animal research and other techniques presently being explored in the life science industry 
these techniques have drawn much negative attention recently in the public forum 
government authorities may regulate or prohibit any of these activities 
additionally  the public may disfavor or reject these activities 
our stock price has fluctuated in the past and could experience substantial declines in the future and  as a result  management s attention may be diverted from tasks that are more productive 
the market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may become volatile and could decline in the future  perhaps substantially  in response to various factors including volatility of the financial markets  
table of contents uncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  revenues and operating results fluctuating or failing to meet the expectations of management  securities analysts  or investors in any quarter  comments of securities analysts and mistakes by or misinterpretation of comments from analysts  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or management guidance  investment banks and securities analysts becoming subject to lawsuits that may adversely affect the perception of the market  conditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  announcements of significant acquisitions or financings or changes in strategic partnerships  non compliance with the internal control standards pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  and a decrease in the demand for our common stock 
in addition  public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volatility 
the stock market and the nasdaq global market in general  and the biotechnology industry and small cap markets in particular  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that at times may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may further harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
provisions of delaware law  of our charter and bylaws and our shareholder rights plan may make a takeover more difficult  which could cause our stock price to decline 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer  change in control or takeover attempt  which is opposed by management and the board of directors 
public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so 
in february  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  the company or a large block of our common stock 
a third party that acquires or more of our common stock an acquiring person could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the shareholder rights plan through the issuance of common stock to all shareholders other than the acquiring person 
we also have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year 
these anti takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors 
such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future 
an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained 
although our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq global market  an active trading market for the shares may not be sustained which could negatively affect the price for our common stock  an investors ability to buy or sell our common stock and the listing thereof 
any issuance of preferred stock in the future may dilute the rights of our common stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  privileges and other terms of these shares 
the board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of future holders of preferred stock 

table of contents cash dividends will not likely be paid on our common stock 
currently  we intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the expansion and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the near future 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock will be a stockholder s sole source of gain for the near future
