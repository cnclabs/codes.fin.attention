item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction premier financial bancorp  inc premier or the company is a multi bank holding company headquartered in huntington  west virginia 
it operates four community bank subsidiaries ranging in size from million to million  each with a local orientation 
the banks operate in twenty six communities within the states of west virginia  virginia  ohio  maryland and kentucky plus the cities of washington  dc and richmond  virginia 
through these locations the banks provide their customers with a full range of banking services 
on september  citizens deposit bank and trust citizens  a wholly owned subsidiary of premier  completed its purchase of four banking offices branch purchase from integra bank na integra bank 
the banking offices are located in maysville and mount olivet  kentucky and ripley and aberdeen  ohio 
citizens paid a million deposit premium for the million of deposit liabilities it assumed and also acquired million of branch related loans as well as million of additional commercial real estate loans and million of other commercial loans selected by citizens originated from other integra offices 
at the open of business on october   premier completed its acquisition of abigail adams national bancorp  inc abigail adams  a million two bank holding company 
the two banks acquired by premier as a result of the acquisition of abigail adams were adams national bank adams national with six locations in and around washington  dc and consolidated bank trust company cb t headquartered in richmond  virginia with one branch location in hampton  virginia 
the results of operations of abigail adams and the four purchased branches are included in premier s consolidated statements of income beginning only from their respective acquisition dates 
on april   premier merged five of its subsidiary banks together 
adams national  cb t  first central bank and traders bank  inc were merged into boone county bank 
the resulting bank moved its headquarters to huntington  west virginia and changed its name to premier bank  inc as of december   premier had approximately billion in total assets  million in total loans  million in total deposits and million in customer repurchase agreements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the management of premier in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the audit committee of the board of directors engaged crowe horwath llp crowe as independent auditors to audit the consolidated financial statements  and their report is included elsewhere herein

the following discussion is designed to assist readers of the consolidated financial statements in understanding significant changes in premier s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  management s objective of a fair presentation of financial information is achieved through a system of internal accounting controls 
the financial control system of premier is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss and that transactions are properly authorized and recorded in the financial records 
as an integral part of that financial control system  the holding company employs a staff of internal auditors and contracts with professional accounting firms to perform internal audits of the financial records of each of the subsidiaries on a periodic basis 
the internal audit manager reports the findings and recommendations highlighted by the internal audits to premier s audit committee as well as the audit committees of the subsidiaries 
also  on a regular periodic basis  the subsidiary banks are examined by federal and state banking authorities for safety and soundness as well as compliance with applicable banking laws and regulations 
the activities of both the internal and external audit functions are reviewed by the audit committee of the board of directors 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth or lack thereof  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
the words may  could  should  would  will  believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  predict  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the 
consolidated financial statements  accompanying 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this annual report 
allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment using accounting guidance issued by financial accounting standards board fasb 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by accounting guidance 
loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
business acquisitions and impairment of goodwill for acquisitions  premier is required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed at their fair value 
these often involve estimates based on third party valuations  such as appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques that may include estimates of attrition  inflation  asset growth rates or other relevant factors 
in addition  the determination of the useful lives over which an intangible asset will be amortized is subjective 
the loans acquired via the purchase of abigail adams and the branch purchase were recorded on the books of premier at their estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded by premier at the date of acquisition 
however  in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail due to uncertainties in the economy  the borrower s ability to repay or other factors  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
under accounting guidance issued by the fasb related to accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of

management s discussion and analysis december  the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis 
summary financial results premier had net income available to common shareholders of million in compared to million of net income available to common shareholders in and million of net income available to common shareholder reported for net income available to common shareholders decreased in largely due to increased expenses  primarily data processing expenses and expenses related to converting data processing systems 
otherwise  net interest income and non interest income increased in  partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses 
net income available to common shareholders decreased in when compared to  due to a million gain recorded in on the acquisition of abigail adams and a full four quarters of preferred stock dividends subtracted from net income in compared to only one quarter in otherwise  net income increased in due to higher interest income and non interest income as well as lower interest expense  which were partially offset by a higher provision for loan losses and higher non interest expense 
the increase in each of these categories was primarily the result of the increase in operations from the acquisition of abigail adams on october  the operating results of abigail adams are included in the consolidated financial statements of premier only from the date of the acquisition 
when comparing operating results to operating results  the operations of abigail adams are included in the full year of but in only the last three months of basic earnings per share were in compared to in and in the decrease in earnings per share in is largely due to the increase in non interest expenses discussed above 
the decrease in earnings per share in is largely due to the impact of the million gain on the subsidiary acquisition which added approximately to premier s reported earnings per share in earnings per share in were also negatively impacted by the increase in the full year average number of shares outstanding resulting from the acquisition of abigail adams late in the terms of the acquisition is more fully described in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years 
return on average assets roa measures how effectively premier utilizes its assets to produce net income 
it also facilitates the analysis of earnings performance of different sized organizations 
in and  premier increased the size of its balance sheet with acquisitions 
the result was an increase in total assets from million at the end of  to  million at the end of  largely due to the acquisitions 
in  total assets 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  declined slightly to  million at december  an increase in asset size will generally result in higher dollars of income earned and expenses incurred 
a detailed review of the components of roa will help analyze premier s performance without regard to changes in its size 
premier s net income available to common shareholders in resulted in an roa of  a decrease from the roa in and the roa in as shown in the following table  fully taxable equivalent net interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level during the last five years in at 
in  this percentage decreased to and decreased again in to as yields on earning assets declined as a result of a lower overall interest rate environment due to federal reserve policies designed to stimulate national economic growth 
in  fully taxable equivalent net interest income increased to as the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities fell more quickly in than the yield earned on average earning assets 
in  net interest income decreased to of average earning assets as the yield on earning assets decreased by more than the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in  net credit income as a percentage of average earnings assets also reached its highest level over the past five years at as net interest income was aided by negative provisions for loan losses recorded in similarly  in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets also reached its highest level in the past five years at while non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets totaled 
in  minimal provisions for loan losses reduced an already lower net interest income as a percent of average earning assets  resulting in net credit income of of average earning assets 
in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets declined somewhat  however  non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets declined in resulting in the lowest ratio over in the last five years 
in  net credit income as a percent of average earning assets declined to  as the lower net interest income was lowered even further by a higher provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was lower non interest income and the highest non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets in the last five years  largely due to acquisition related expenses  a special fdic insurance assessment  and writedowns on the value of other real estate owned oreo 
adding to premier s return on average assets in was a gain recognized on the acquisition of abigail adams and lower income tax expense 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier s return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to 
in  the increase in net interest income as a percent of average earning assets was more than offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets lowering net credit income to of average earning assets 
further lowering premier s return on average assets in was lower non interest income as a percent of average earning assets due to lower deposit customer fee income in relation to the total deposits outstanding and no gain on the acquisition of a subsidiary as was recorded in on the positive side  non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets decreased in to compared to in  largely due to reduced acquisition related expenses and lower oreo costs due to gains realized 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  on the disposition of some oreo properties in income tax expense as a percentage of average earning assets was the lowest level in  largely due to the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded on the recognition of future west virginia net operating losses 
lastly  dividends and accretion accrued on premier s series a preferred stock also serve to reduce net income available to common shareholders and thus reduce premier s roa 
in  preferred stock dividends and accretion totaled as a percent of average earning assets 
as illustrated in the table  the overall result was to decrease premier s return on average earning assets to and decrease its return on average total assets roa to 
in  net interest income as a percent of average earning assets decreased from and was further reduced by a slight increase in the provision for loan losses as a percent of average earning assets lowering net credit income to of average earning assets  the lowest percentage in the five year period presented 
non interest income as a percent of average earning assets held steady in compared to  but non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets increased to  largely due to the increase in data processing expenses and the conversion expenses 
income tax expense as a percentage of average earning assets was the lowest level in  but only slightly less than the percentages reported for and also similar to  preferred stock dividends and accretion in totaled as a percent of average earning assets 
dividends and accretion accrued on premier s series a preferred stock also serve to reduce net income available to common shareholders and thus reduce premier s roa

management s discussion and analysis december  the net overhead ratio non interest expense less non interest income as a percent of average earning assets increased in to 
the ratio compares favorably to the net overhead ratio reported in  but is still higher than the reported in  the reported in and the reported in  the lowest ratio reported in the last five years 
the increase in the net overhead ratio was largely the result of higher operating expenses  primarily those related to data processing and expenses related to converting to a different data processing provider 
the lower net overhead ratio in was largely the result of a lower ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to operational savings  lower acquisition expenses and gains on the sale of some oreo in compared to negatively affecting the net overhead ratio was a lower ratio of non interest income to average earning assets  largely due to the lower non interest income ratio of the acquired abigail adams banks compared to the historical results of premier s other subsidiary banks 
this lower trend continued into as well as a lower level of secondary market mortgage commissions 
in  the higher net overhead ratio was largely the result of a higher ratio of non interest expense to average earning assets due to acquisition related expenses  significantly higher fdic insurance costs  higher oreo costs and relatively less efficient operations of the acquired abigail adams subsidiary banks 
return on average common equity roe  another measure of earnings performance  indicates the amount of net income earned in relation to the total equity invested by holders of common stock 
premier s roe was compared to in and realized in roe decreased in due to the significantly lower roa in and a slightly lower multiple of average assets to average common equity in roe decreased in due to the decrease in roa which offset the benefits of a higher multiple of average assets to average equity in

management s discussion and analysis december  in  average earning assets increased by or million from  following a or million increase in from average interest bearing liabilities  the primary source of funds supporting the earning assets  increased by only  or million  in from  which follows a  or million  increase in over also supporting the growth in average earning assets in was a million  or  increase in average non interest bearing deposits 
the large increases in over were primarily the result of the full year inclusion of the earning assets obtained via the acquisition of abigail adams in october this acquisition added million of average earning assets and million of interest bearing liabilities in in  the increase in average earning assets was primarily the result of a million increase in average investment securities and a million increase in average total loans  partially offset by an million decrease in average federal funds sold and a million decrease in average interest bearing bank balances 
the slight increase in average interest bearing liabilities in was largely due to a million increase in average interest bearing deposits  a million increase in average short term borrowings primarily customer repurchase agreements  and a million net increase in long term borrowings 
excluding the impact of the abigail adams acquisition  the remaining million increase in average earning assets in was primarily the result of a million increase in average total loans  a million increase in average investment securities  and a million increase in average interest bearing bank balances  partially offset by a million decrease in average federal funds sold 
excluding the impact of the abigail adams acquisition  average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  in from the increase in average interest bearing liabilities in was the result of a million increase in average interest bearing deposits  partially offset by a million decrease in average long term borrowings and a million decrease in average short term borrowings  primarily customer repurchase agreements 
furthermore  the increase in average interest bearing deposits was complemented by a million  or  increase in average non interest bearing deposits  million for the acquisition of abigail adams and million from internal growth and the branch purchase in loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans increased in by million  or  over following a million  or  increase in over the modest increase in is largely due to weak loan demand combined with loan payoffs resulting not only from borrowers accelerating the reduced in their outstanding debt  but also payoffs due to the workout of problem loans 
the growth in average loans resulted from increases in balances in premier s kentucky and ohio markets  substantially offset by decreases in average loans outstanding in premier s west virginia  dc metro and virginia markets 
in  premier realized a million  or  increase in average outstanding loans in its kentucky markets 
a significant portion of the loan growth in this market came from the full year inclusion of the loans acquired via the branch purchase in september otherwise  
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  average loans outstanding increased by million  or  in premier s ohio markets but decreased by million  or  in premier s dc metro market  decreased by million  or  in premier s virginia markets and decreased million  or  in premier s west virginia markets 
the increase is largely attributable to the full year impact of the acquisition of abigail adams in  which increased average total loans by million in excluding the increase attributed to the abigail adams acquisition  average total loans increased by million or in from this increase is the result of growth in premier s ohio  kentucky and west virginia loan markets 
in  premier realized a million or million increase in average outstanding loans in its kentucky markets  a million or increase in its west virginia markets  and a million increase in its ohio markets 
a significant portion of the loan growth in these markets came from the loans acquired via the branch purchase in september total loans at december  decreased by million  or  from the total at december  this decrease follows a million  or  increase from the total at december  the decrease in is due to decreases in loans outstanding in all of premier s markets as loan payments and payoffs exceeded demand for new loans 
the increase in is largely due to the increases in loans at premier s kentucky  west virginia and ohio banks  which more than offset loan payments and payoffs at premier s dc and virginia banks 
total loans in the dc market decreased by million in  while loans in the virginia market decreased by million 
these decreases were more than offset by the million increase in loans in premier s other markets  largely due to the million of loans acquired via the branch purchase in september loans secured by real estate totaled of premier s loan portfolio at december   up from the of total loans at december  the increase is largely due to an increase in commercial real estate loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio 
the increase more than offset a decrease in construction and land development loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio 
residential real estate loans  as a percentage of the total loan portfolio  remained relatively unchanged in compared to in  loans secured by real estate decreased from of premier s loan portfolio at december  to approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december   largely due to a decrease in construction loans as a percentage of total loans outstanding 
in  loans secured by real estate in total increased from of premier s loan portfolio at december  to approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december  due to the loans acquired from abigail adams 
the mix of loans acquired from abigail adams was significantly different from premier s other affiliate bank loan portfolios  which consist of a diverse portfolio of predominantly single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
the december  balances of the loans acquired from adams national were predominantly commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans  including million of loans secured by non owner occupied commercial property  million of loans secured by owner occupied commercial property  million of multi family residential real estate loans and million of commercial real estate construction and land development loans 
the concentrations in these kinds of loans was 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  one of the factors motivating the occ to require adams national to enter into a formal written agreement to reduce these concentrations 
the mix of december  balances of the loans acquired from cb t were closer to the ratios of premier s other affiliate banks but were still predominantly commercial real estate loans and real estate construction loans due in part to loan participations with adams national 
while there are generally additional risks of loss associated with commercial real estate lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions  the borrowers inability to successfully execute their business plans and or deterioration in the value of the commercial real estate collateral  the loans acquired from adams national and cb t were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date taking into account credit risks in the loans acquired 
see additional discussion below on the impaired loans acquired from adams national and cb t 
premier s residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan at the time of origination 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market and recognizes non interest income upon the sale of those mortgages in the form of commissions and servicing release fees 
premier has not engaged in the solicitation of so called sub prime or interest only mortgages 
premier uses an experienced staff underwriter to ensure the completeness of the borrowers loan application and documentation and to ensure that the loans meet the standards required by prospective loan purchasers 
additional information regarding the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold is contained in premier s consolidated statements of cash flows presented elsewhere in this annual report 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plans 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

management s discussion and analysis december  the following table presents a five year comparison of loans by type

note to the consolidated financial statements 
total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms offering a concession to enable a delinquent borrower to repay troubled debt restructurings and accruing loans past due days or more  were million  or  of total assets at year end these amounts compare to million of total non performing assets  or of total assets at year end and million of total non performing assets  or of total assets at year end the increase in from year end was largely due to a million increase in loans past due days or more  a million increase in oreo and a million increase in restructured loans 
these increases more than offset the million decrease in non accrual loans 
the decrease in from year end was largely due to a reduction in troubled debt restructuring as restructuring plans were successful in helping borrowers get back on schedule with their loan payments 
otherwise  non accrual loans increased by million and oreo increased by million in the significant increase in non performing assets came in with the acquisition of abigail adams and its two subsidiary banks 
at december   these two banks accounted for million  or of premier s non performing assets 
at december   the same two banks from abigail adams accounted for million  or of premier s non performing assets  as an increase in non accrual loans at the two banks was substantially offset by a decrease in oreo 
at december   the operations covered by the markets of the acquired abigail adams banks accounted for million  or of premier s non performing assets 
however  since these assets were recorded at an estimated fair value on the date of acquisition  the amount of credit risk assumed by premier is not nearly as great as the volume of non performing assets suggests taken at face value 
the estimate of fair value on all loans  but particularly on non performing assets  included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates included significant discounts on the non accrual loans 
since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  consistent with new accounting guidance for acquisitions after  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
under previous accounting standards  the loan loss allowance of acquired banks would have carried over to premier s books and records  as was the case for the acquisitions of traders bankshares and citizens first bank

management s discussion and analysis december  the following table illustrates the and year end face value and the discounted net carrying value of the non performing located in the two markets washington  dc and richmond  virginia added to premier s operations from the acquisition of abigail adams 
these markets were the operational territories of the former adams national bank in washington  dc and the former consolidated bank and trust in richmond  virginia  both of which were merged into premier s wholly owned subsidiary  boone county bank  to form premier bank on april  non performing assets at acquired subsidiary banks dollars in thousands december  december  face value discounted net carrying value face value discounted net carrying value non performing assets non accrual loans loans days past due other real estate owned total non performing assets face value includes reductions for interest payments received on loans while on non accrual status in accordance with the cost recovery method of accounting for non accrual loans 
excluding the non performing assets from the abigail adams acquisition  the remaining million increase in non performing assets in is largely due to a million increase in restructured loans 
these loans were performing in accordance with their modified terms at december   but because the loan terms were modified to assist the borrower to repay the loan  the loans are included with total non performing assets 
most of premier s restructured loans are loans that have been modified to allow the borrower to pay interest only for a limited amount of time 
also included in the remaining million increase in non performing assets in is a  increase in non accrual loans offset by a  decrease in loans days past due and a  decrease in other real estate owned oreo 
management believes the estimated potential losses related to delinquent loans to be adequately provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
these non performing assets were included in the analyses that supported the recording of provisions for loan loss during and as management s efforts to collect on all of the company s non performing assets continue  matured loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
as previously demonstrated by premier s history  management is committed to continuing to reduce its level of non performing assets and maintaining strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in non accrual loans and loans days past due

management s discussion and analysis december  its other affiliate banks in and were masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   total non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million 
this experience and performance in pursuing the collection of non performing assets was a factor in management s decision to pursue the acquisition of abigail adams and its high level of non performing assets 
while the circumstances related to the collection of every non performing loan is different  with the benefit of the additional capital provided by premier s participation in the tarp capital purchase program and the requirement to record the non performing assets at their estimated fair value at acquisition date  management believes it will be successful in resolving a majority of the non performing assets acquired from abigail adams 
the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans where management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
primarily through its acquisition of abigail adams  premier now has million of construction loans on non accrual status at december  whereby additional funds may be needed by the borrower to complete the project 
for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations

management s discussion and analysis december  during  premier recorded  of gains on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns  compared to  of gains on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns  in the net gains realized in are largely due to sales of oreo properties acquired via the abigail adams acquisition

in  premier recorded  of gains on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns  compared to  of writedowns and losses on the disposition of oreo properties  net of gains in similar to  the net gains realized in are largely due to sales of oreo properties acquired via the abigail adams acquisition which had improved values at the time of sale  or were properties where premier spent funds on repairing or completing certain properties prior to their sale 
the oreo writedowns and losses in primarily relate to properties held at the newly acquired traders bank 
carrying values of oreo properties were compared to updated appraisals and additional writedowns of the property value were charged directly to operations based upon the updated net realizable value 
the properties were primarily undeveloped vacant land 
although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than originally contracted terms 
during  approximately million of interest income was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  including approximately million from the recognition of purchase discounts upon loan payoff  while approximately million would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are more likely to be classified as impaired 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions

management s discussion and analysis december  a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial conditions and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed  assessing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate  a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
in  premier recorded  of additional provisions for loan losses compared to  of additional provisions for loan losses in and  of additional provisions for loan losses in conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions include greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans in was largely the result of a million decrease in total loans at december  the million of additional provisions for loan losses in was slightly offset by million of net charge offs recorded in  reducing the allowance by approximately  the increase in the level of provision expense during was largely to provide for a calculated increase in exposure to credit risk related to one borrowing relationship in premier s kentucky market identified during the second quarter 
the loan was eventually charged off in the fourth quarter of while premier is continuing to pursue available collection remedies  management determined that the borrowing relationship should be charged off in accordance with the company s loan policies and procedures 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the increase in the ratio of the allowance to total loans in was the 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  result of million of additional provisions for loan losses exceeding the million of net charge offs 
the additional provisions for loan losses recorded in were largely due to million of provisions recorded for loans acquired from abigail adams as loans were reanalyzed for impairment through out the year 
the remaining banks recorded a collective provision for loan losses of million in  which is similar to the provision recorded by these banks in at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans  compared to an allowance for loan losses of million  or of total loans at december  the significant decrease in the ratio of allowance to total loans was directly the result of adding the million of loans from the acquisition of abigail adams without adding any allowance for loan losses 
new accounting guidance adopted by premier at the beginning of does not permit an acquirer to carry over the purchased entity s allowance for loan losses 
instead  under the new accounting guidance  all acquired loans are to be recorded at their net estimated fair value 
the estimate of fair value included factors for the measurement of credit risk  interest rate risk and re salability in the most advantageous market for the loans in an orderly transaction between market participants 
these estimates required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments and are inherently uncertain 
however  since the estimated fair value of these loans were believed to have accounted for the reasonably estimable credit risk in the loans  no allowance for loan losses for these loans was recorded at the date of acquisition 
at september   just prior to premier s acquisition  abigail adams reported a collective allowance for loan losses of approximately million 
in contrast  premier recorded the estimated fair value of the combined loan portfolios at an estimated million discount to the contractual amounts receivable on the loans at acquisition 
these discounts  allocated per loan  will be used to offset any charge offs of the uncollectible portion of the contractual amount due on non performing assets  or accreted into interest income using a level yield method on performing loans 
should premier collect the full contractual amount due  any fair value discount would be recognized as interest income 
excluding the loans acquired from abigail adams  the remaining allowance for loan losses was of total year end loans 
the decrease in the ratio is largely due to the charge off of loans to one borrower that had been identified and carried as an impaired loan for more than three years 
premier finally received permission from the bankruptcy court to foreclose upon and liquidate the collateral 
the actual charge off was approximately the amount of allowance allocated to the loan during its classification as an impaired loan 
the allowance for loan losses was also reduced by the million of net charge offs in which was only partially offset by the million of additional provisions for loan losses during the year 
a summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above

management s discussion and analysis december  the following table provides a more detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
since  the deterioration in the national economy and its impact on the local economy in its markets has resulted in increases in past due loans and non performing assets for premier 
as such  management s estimate of the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio began to increase in as the deterioration in the national economy and its impact on premier s local economies continued in  and  some of the increases in past due loans and non performing assets in prior years became charged off loans in  and additional provisions for loan losses were recorded in as the estimated credit risk in the remaining loan portfolio was evaluated 
the level of additional provisions increased in to provide for estimated loan impairment  primarily as additional loans from the acquisition of abigail adams were downgraded and analyzed for impairment 
the increase in the level of provision expense during was largely to provide for a calculated increase in exposure to credit risk related to one borrowing relationship in premier s kentucky market identified during the second quarter 
premier aggressively pursues past due loans in an effort to bring those loans back to current status 
if these efforts fail and a past due loan becomes a non performing loan  premier s policies for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses are used to determine the estimated potential loss on the loan 
future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio

charge offs of commercial loans and loans secured by commercial real estate totaled million or approximately of the total charge offs recorded in  the highest level recorded over the past five years 
consumer charge offs increased by  even with the increases  net charge offs were still only of average outstanding loans in although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans 
premier continues to make a significant effort to reduce its past due and non performing loans by reviewing loan files  using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and or the foreclosure and sale of oreo properties 
as in the past  when these plans are executed  premier may experience increases in non performing loans and non performing assets 
furthermore  any resulting increases in loans placed on non accrual status will have a negative impact on future loan interest income 
also  as these plans are executed  other loans may be identified that would necessitate additional charge offs and potentially additional provisions for loan losses 
premier continues to monitor and evaluate the impact that national housing market price declines may have on its local markets and collateral valuations as management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while some price deterioration is expected  it is not currently anticipated that premier s markets will be impacted as severely as other areas of the country due to the historically modest increases in real estate values in the company s markets in west virginia  ohio and kentucky

management s discussion and analysis december  investment portfolio and other earning assets investment securities averaged million in  up million  or  from the million averaged in this increase follows a million or increase in from the million averaged in the increase during is largely attributable to the growth in funding from non interest bearing deposits coupled with weak loan demand 
during  as loan payments and payoffs exceeded the demand for new loans  some of the proceeds from the loan payments were invested in investment securities 
likewise  as surplus funds increased as a result of growth in non interest bearing deposits  these funds were also invested in investment securities 
investment securities are highly liquid and generally have a greater yield than interest bearing bank balances or federal funds sold 
however their longer investment term generally results in greater interest rate risk over other short term investments 
this was believed to be especially true in and  as management continued to invest based on a belief that market interest rates were at their lowest level and that buying longer term investments would have the effect of locking in these lowest interest rates over the life of the investments 
due to the low interest rate environment during and continuing throughout  issuers of investment securities were routinely invoking call features within their securities and reissuing new bonds at lower coupon rates 
during  million of premier s investment securities were either called or matured  compared to million during to offset some of the effects of interest rate risk in the investment portfolio  premier began purchased collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s issued by the government national mortgage association gnma  also known as ginnie mae 
these cmo s are similar to us treasury bonds in that they are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states government  but unlike us treasury bonds  return a portion of the principal each month coinciding with the monthly principal payments made by mortgage borrowers collateralizing the securities 
it is the monthly return of principal that will allow premier to take advantage of any rise in market interest rates by investing the principal payments in the future  higher yielding securities long before the final maturity date of the cmo 
an added feature of these gnma cmo s is that the securities are not subject to early call provisions 
only the mortgagees prepayment of their underlying mortgages can accelerate the principal reduction on the investment security 
thus  the purchase yield is not as susceptible to downward interest rate risks as investment securities with call features 
this benefit is illustrated by the lower amount of premier s securities that were either called or matured in during  million of investments were called or matured including principal payments on cmo s and mortgage backed securities compared to million during and million during the increase in average investment securities in is largely attributable to the full year impact of the acquisition of abigail adams in  which increased average investment securities by million in excluding the increase attributed to the abigail adams acquisition  average investment securities increased by million or

based upon analyses of asset liability repricing  interest rate forecasts  and liquidity requirements  funds are periodically reinvested in high quality debt securities  which typically mature over a longer period of time 
at the time of purchase  management determines whether the securities will be classified as trading  available for sale  or held to maturity

the table uses a weighted estimated average life method to report the average maturity of mortgage backed securities  which includes the estimated effect of monthly payments and prepayments

management s discussion and analysis december  premier s average investment in federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances decreased in compared to this decrease follows a increase in averaging million in  federal funds sold and interest bearing bank balances decreased million from the million in the decrease in reflects the migration of some of premier s most highly liquid yet lowest yielding assets into higher yielding investment securities

to obtain higher yields on its most highly liquid funds  in premier began shifting some of its federal funds sold to certificates of deposits with other banks and other interest bearing bank balances  primarily with the federal reserve bank  which yielded  on average  in and in this practice continued in as the yield on interest bearing bank balances averaged  far exceeding the yield on average federal funds sold 
the average balance of federal funds sold decreased by million in to million  while average interest bearing bank balances decreased by million in to million 
the majority of these interest bearing bank balances are held at federal reserve banks 
yields on federal funds sold rise and fall in direct correlation with interest rate changes made by the federal reserve board in establishing national economic policy 
investment security yields are based on a number of pricing factors  including but not limited to coupon rate  time to maturity and issuer credit quality 
fluctuations in the amount of federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report 
funding sources in response to the federal reserve policy to reduce market interest rates by lowering the target federal funds rate  in premier began cutting its rates paid on its interest bearing deposits 
this change follows a three year period during which premier was raising the rates paid on its interest bearing deposits in response to the increase in market interest rates 
as a result  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased to in  down from the paid in  and the paid in the basis point decrease in was primarily the result of a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit and other time deposits  which made up of the total average interest bearing liabilities in other rate decreases on deposits in include a basis point decrease on savings deposits while the rate on now and money market accounts remained unchanged in from likewise  in  premier decreased the rate paid on its short term borrowings  primarily repurchase agreements with deposit customers  by basis points

most customers are still keeping their maturity choices short in order to take advantage of possible higher interest rates in the future 
while offering some special certificate of deposit rates in and to remain competitive  premier continued to focus on building its base of customer relationships by offering more convenient electronic banking products to its non interest bearing deposit customers 
in order to help maintain their liquidity and reduce their reliance on short term borrowings  prior to their acquisition by premier the two subsidiary banks of abigail adams participated in a network of approved banks that exchange customer certificates of deposit called the certificate of deposit account registry service program  also known as cdars 
this program allows local customers to open certificates of deposit in amounts greater than the standard fdic insurance coverage limits at their local bank and still maintain fdic insurance coverage on the deposits as the local bank enters the certificates of deposit into a national exchange network which provides fdic insurance coverage by opening accounts in the customer s name at other participating banks in the network in increments less than the standard fdic coverage limits 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds  and a sophisticated matching system enables network members to exchange funds with each other on a dollar for dollar basis 
to participate in the program  banks subject to a written agreement with their primary regulator  such as adams national at that time  are required to get permission from the fdic 
during  even though adams national was a participant in the network and currently had deposits from the cdars network  the bank was denied permission by the fdic to continue to open new or renew existing cdars deposits while it was subject to its written agreement with the occ  its primary regulator 
during  as the cdars deposits matured  adams national was able to retain more than of the maturing cdars as certificates of deposit with adams national and no longer part of the cdars network 
under long existing fdic rules for banks owned by the same holding company under common control  such as each of premier s affiliate banks  each bank under common control is obligated to guarantee the liquidity of deposit funds over and above the fdic coverage limits at each of the other banks under the same common control 
in other words  each of premier s affiliate banks are obligated to provide liquidity for each of the other premier affiliate banks to the extent it may be needed for deposit withdrawals 
premier believes that knowledge of this guarantee resulted in holders of some of the maturing cdars related deposits at adams national to renew their certificates of deposit at adams national outside of the cdars program 
in  the remaining million of cdars at adams national matured 
none of the affiliate banks currently participate in generating new cdars deposits

management s discussion and analysis december  asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model developed by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates from and basis points  but never below zero 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects that net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

base rate liquidity liquidity is the ability to satisfy demands for deposit withdrawals  lending commitments  and other corporate needs 
premier s liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries

furthermore  premier s banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in as illustrated in the consolidated statement of cash flows  the decrease in cash from operations generated in was primarily the result of non cash generating income from the gain on the acquisition of subsidiary and changes in other assets and liabilities

capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio increased to during  an increase from the during but less than the average equity to asset ratio in the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size 
the increase in was the result of a higher percentage increase in average equity  primarily from the generation of million of retained net income  exceeding the percentage growth in average assets 
the decrease in was largely due to the full year impact of the average assets from the abigail adams acquisition in and the partial year increase in average assets from the branch acquisition 
the branch acquisition was a cash purchase which added no additional direct equity

management s discussion and analysis december  to the company 
equity was strengthened in by additional capital from the million of retained net income generated during the year 
this increase in equity was partially offset by diminished equity resulting from a decrease in the market value of investments from a million net unrealized gain at the end of to a million net unrealized loss at the end of in  premier s average equity to asset ratio was enhanced by the additional equity added from the sale of series a preferred stock to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program

the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s capital to risk adjusted asset ratio was  compared to at december  and at december  all three of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets  net of any related deferred taxes as permitted 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  and at december  all three of these ratios are above the to ratios recommended by the federal reserve 
the increase in the leverage ratio was a combined result of a decrease in total assets  an increase in total stockholders equity and a decrease in the amounts of goodwill and other intangibles that are subtracted from stockholders equity by regulation 
similarly  the increase in the capital to risk adjusted assets ratio in is the combined result of a decrease in risk adjusted assets along with the increase in total capital 
the decrease in the leverage ratio was largely the result of the additional tangible assets from the branch purchase combined with a reduction in tangible equity resulting from the goodwill and core deposit intangible recorded as part of the branch purchase 
the increase in the capital to risk adjusted assets ratio in is largely the result of a minimal increase in risk adjusted assets as premier increased its holdings of less riskier liquid assets and kept more of those liquid assets in interest bearing deposit accounts with the federal reserve which are given a zero percent risk factor 
also minimizing the increase in risk adjusted assets in was the purchase of million of additional zero percent risk factor investment securities such as gnma backed cmo s 
premier s capital ratios are the direct result of management s desire to maintain a strong capital position 
this strong capital position tends to have a dampening effect on the key performance ratio return on average equity roe due to the higher level of capital maintained

net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  up from the million earned in  which follows a increase in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the increase in net interest income in is largely the result of savings on interest paid on certificates of deposit exceeding a decrease in interest income on loans 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  in  increases in interest income from the increase in the volume of earning assets such as loans and investment securities was more than offset by decreases in interest income resulting from lower yields earned on those assets 
the net result was an  decrease in interest income on loans and a  decrease in interest income on investment securities 
also  as shown in the table below  interest expense on deposits increased by only  as a result of changes in the volume in interest bearing deposits  as the increase in interest expense from the increase in the average volume of certificates of deposit and savings deposits was substantially offset by the decrease in interest expense from the decrease in the average volume of now and money market deposit accounts 
however  due to lower rates paid on certificates of deposit in  premier saved million of interest expense  more than offsetting the increase in interest expense due to the higher volume of average interest bearing liabilities and the decrease in interest income from loans and investment securities described above

the combined effect was to increase net interest income by  in the increase in net interest income in is largely due to the million increase in fully tax equivalent net interest income generated by the inclusion of abigail adams for the first nine months of in  the operations of abigail adams were only included in the financial results of premier since the october  acquisition date

as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income increased by million  or in as shown in the table of non interest income and expense below  total fees and other income increased by  or in the increase in was largely due to increases in electronic banking income and other non interest income partially offset by decreases in service charges on deposit accounts and secondary market mortgage income 
in  service charges on deposit accounts decreased by  or  due to lower revenue from monthly account charges on consumer and business checking accounts as well as a lower propensity of customers to overdraft their deposit accounts 
management believes that the downturn in the economy has caused customers to more closely manage their deposit funds to find ways to save money and thus reduce their number of overdrafts

management s discussion and analysis december  applicable income taxes premier recognized million of income tax expense in this amount compares to million of income tax expense recorded in and million of income tax expense recorded in premier s effective tax rate was in  up from the reported in and the reported in premier s effective tax rate was substantially lower in primarily because the acquisition of abigail adams was a tax free reorganization under the internal revenue code and therefore the accounting gain on the acquisition was a non taxable event 
excluding the gain from pretax income in would result in an effective tax rate of approximately 
the lower effective tax rate in is largely due to the recognition of a  net of federal income tax expense  west virginia income tax benefit resulting from premier s projected ability to fully realize its west virginia state deferred tax assets 
the majority of the state deferred tax assets are made up of west virginia net operating loss carryforwards  some of which were incurred as a result of premier s historical operations and some of which were obtained from the traders bankshares acquisition in the projection takes into account changes in west virginia s corporation income tax rules regarding consolidated income tax returns and the likelihood that the projected taxable income from the acquired banks will accelerate the utilization of all carryforwards

effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one effect is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report
