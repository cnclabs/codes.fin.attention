item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may cause our revenues  profitability and cash flows to decrease during our company  like others in the industry  utilizes reporting metrics focused on units 
consistent with our strategy to focus on the customer  we also utilize residential and business customer metrics that  when combined with unit counts  provides additional insight into the results of our strategic initiatives described above

products per residential customer primary residential voice line  hsi and video products have a value of long distance  frontier secure  second lines  feature packages and dial up have a value of calculation excludes the mohave cellular limited partnership 
network architecture and technology our local exchange carrier networks consist of central office hosts and remote sites  primarily equipped with digital and internet protocol switches 
the outside plant consists of transport and distribution delivery networks connecting our host central office with remote central offices and ultimately with our customers 
we own fiber optic and copper cable  which have been deployed in our networks and are the primary transport technologies between our host and remote central offices and interconnection points with other incumbent carriers 
our fiber optic and copper transport system is capable of supporting increasing customer demand for high bandwidth transport services 
we are currently upgrading our network with the latest internet protocol transport and routing equipment  reconfigurable optical adm add drop multiplexers roadm transport systems  very high bit rate dsl vdsl hsi equipment  and voice over internet protocol voip switches 
these systems will support advanced service such as metro ethernet  dedicated internet  multiprotocol label switching mpls transport  and voip 
the network is designed with redundancy and auto failover capability on our major circuits 
as of december   approximately of the households in our legacy territories had access to our broadband products with at least mbps 
as of december   approximately of the households in the acquired territories had access to broadband products with at least mbps 
rapid and significant changes in technology are expected to continue to occur in the communications industry 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes 
we believe that our existing network architecture will enable us to respond to these technological changes efficiently 
in addition  we anticipate reducing costs through the sharing of best practices across operations  centralization or standardization of functions and processes  and deployment of technologies and systems that provide for greater efficiencies and profitability 
competition competition in the communications industry is intense 
we experience competition from many communications service providers  including cable operators offering video  data and voip products  wireless carriers  long distance providers  competitive local exchange carriers  internet providers and other wireline carriers 
we believe that as of december   approximately of the households in our territories could receive voice  data and video services from a competitive provider 
residential and business customer behavior is affected by the ongoing economic uncertainty 
customers have reduced their spending by not purchasing our services or by discontinuing some or all of our services 
these trends may continue and may result in a continued challenging revenue environment 
the weak economic environment may produce increased delinquencies and bankruptcies and  therefore  affect our ability to collect money owed to us by residential and business customers 
we employ a number of strategies to combat the competitive pressures and changes in customer behavior noted above 
our strategies are focused on preserving and generating new revenues through customer retention  upgrading and up selling services to existing customers  new customer growth  win backs of former customers  new product deployment  and by managing our profitability and cash flow through targeted reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures 
we are focused on enhancing the customer experience to differentiate us from our competition 
our commitment to providing customer service is demonstrated by our us based workforce  our expanded customer service hours  shorter scheduling windows for in home appointments  call reminders and follow up calls for service appointments 
additionally  we seek to achieve our customer retention goals by offering attractive packages of value added services to our local access line customers 
our bundled services include hsi  unlimited long distance calling  enhanced telephone features and video offerings 
we are also focused on increasing sales of existing products  including unlimited long distance minutes  bundles of long distance minutes  wireless data  internet portal advertising  and the frontier secure product suite 
this last category is a suite of products that is aimed at managing the personal computing experience for our customers and is designed to provide value and simplicity to meet customers ever changing needs 
the frontier secure products and services suite includes services such as an in home  full installation of the company s hsi product  two hour appointment windows for the installation  hard drive back up services  help desk pc support and inside wire maintenance when bundled 
in  the frontier secure products generated approximately million in revenue 
our www 
tumtiki 
com website  that launched in november  provides easy online access to free television programs  video on demand movies and other entertainment 
hard drive back up services  help desk pc support and our www 
tumtiki 
com website are also available to consumers and small businesses throughout the united states 
although we are optimistic about the opportunities to increase revenue and reduce customer churn ie  customer attrition that are provided by each of these initiatives  we cannot provide assurance about their long term profitability or impact on revenue 
on the commercial side of our business  we are focused on many of the same strategies and enhancements described above as well as providing state of the art transport services to wireless cell towers in our territories and expanding the number of people selling and servicing our medium  enterprise and government customers with sophisticated products and services eg  ip pbx  e equipment  ethernet  sip trunking 
the goal of offering multiple products and services to our customers pursuant to price protection programs  billing on a single bill  on line bill pay  providing superior customer service  and being active in our local communities is to generate customer loyalty which should help us generate new  and retain existing  customer revenue 
for additional discussion of our competitive strategies  see company strategies above 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries regulatory environment the majority of our operations are regulated by the fcc and various state regulatory agencies  often called public service or utility commissions 
some of our revenue is subject to regulation by the fcc and various state regulatory agencies 
we expect federal and state lawmakers to continue to review and revise the statutes governing the level and type of regulation for telecommunications services 
regulation of our business we are subject to federal  state and local regulation 
we have various regulatory authorizations for our regulated service offerings 
at the federal level  the fcc generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of common carriers  such as our company  to the extent those facilities are used to provide  originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications services 
state regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over common carriers facilities and services to the extent those facilities are used to provide  originate or terminate intrastate telecommunications services 
in particular  state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over the provision by incumbent telephone companies of interconnection and non discriminatory network access to competitive providers 
in addition  local governments often regulate the public rights of way necessary to install and operate networks  and may require service providers to obtain licenses or franchises regulating their use of public rights of way 
municipalities and other local government agencies also may regulate other limited aspects of our business  by requiring us to obtain construction permits and to abide by building codes 
we believe that competition in our telephone service areas will continue to increase in the future as a result of the telecommunications act of the act or the telecommunications act and actions taken by the fcc and state regulatory authorities  and through increased deployment of various types of technology  although the ultimate form and degree of competition cannot be predicted at this time 
competition may lead to loss of revenues and profitability as a result of loss of customers  reduced usage of our network by our customers who may use alternative providers for voice and data services  and reductions in prices for our services which may be necessary to meet competition 
under the act  state regulatory commissions have jurisdiction to arbitrate and review interconnection disputes and agreements between ilecs and competitive local exchange carriers  in accordance with rules set by the fcc 
state regulatory commissions also may impose fees on providers of telecommunications services within their respective states to support state universal service programs 
many of the states in which we operate require prior approvals or notifications for certain acquisitions and transfers of assets  customers  or ownership of regulated entities 
in connection with granting their approvals of the transaction  the fcc and certain state regulatory commissions specified certain capital expenditure and operating requirements for the acquired territories for specified periods of time post closing 
these requirements focus primarily on certain capital investment commitments to expand broadband availability to at least of the households throughout the acquired territories with minimum speeds of megabits per second mbps by the end of and mbps by the end of to satisfy all or part of certain capital investment commitments to three state regulatory commissions  we placed an aggregate amount of million in cash into escrow accounts and obtained a letter of credit for million in another million of cash in an escrow account with a cash balance of million and an associated liability of million as of december  was acquired in connection with the transaction to be used for service quality initiatives in the state of west virginia 
as of december   million had been released from these escrow accounts 
in addition  as of this date  the letter of credit has been reduced to million 
the aggregate amount of these escrow accounts and the letter of credit has decreased and will continue to decrease over time as frontier makes the required capital expenditures in the respective states 
in addition  in certain states  we are subject to operating restrictions such as rate caps including maintenance of existing rates on residential and business products and wholesale prices and terms of interconnection agreements with competitive local exchange carriers and arrangements with carriers that  in each case  existed as of the time of the transaction  continuation of product bundle offerings that we offered before the transaction  and restrictions on how early termination fees are calculated  restrictions on caps on usage of broadband capacity  and certain minimum service quality standards for a defined period of time the failure of which to meet may result in penalties  including  in one state  cash management limitations on certain of our subsidiaries in that one state 
in one other state  our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends up to the parent company for a period of approximately four years 
we are also required to report certain financial information and adhere for a period of time to certain conditions regulating competition and consumer protection 
although most of these requirements are generally consistent with our business plans  they may restrict our flexibility in operating our business during the specified periods  including our ability to raise rates in a declining revenue environment and to manage cash transfers from our subsidiaries in two states if we do not meet certain operating service criteria 
some legislation and regulations are  or could in the future be  the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proposals or challenges which could change the manner in which the entire industry operates 
neither the outcome of any of these developments  nor their potential impact on us  can be predicted at this time 
regulation can change rapidly in the communications industry  and such changes may have an adverse effect on us 
see risk factors risks related to regulation changes in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive 
regulation of the telecommunications industry at the federal and state level at the federal level and in a number of the states in which we operate  we are subject to price cap or incentive regulation plans under which prices for regulated services are capped in return for the elimination or relaxation of earnings oversight 
the goal of these plans is to provide incentives to improve efficiencies and increased pricing flexibility for competitive services while ensuring that customers receive reasonable rates for basic services 
some of these plans have limited terms and  as they expire  we may need to renegotiate with various states 
these negotiations could impact rates  service quality and or infrastructure requirements which could impact our earnings and capital expenditures 
in other states in which we operate  we are subject to rate of return regulation that limits levels of earnings and returns on investments 
approximately  access lines  or of our total access lines  at december  are in state jurisdictions under the rate of return regulatory model 
the fcc s national broadband plan  a non binding set of recommendations released in march and described further below  recommends requiring all incumbent local exchange carriers to be regulated for interstate services  if at all  under incentive regulation 
on november   the fcc released a report and order and further notice of proposed rulemaking on the subject of universal service fund and intercarrier compensation reform usf icc report order 
the usf icc report order stated that carriers that are generally considered price cap carriers  such as frontier  with remaining rate of return operations would have those operations included as part of the carrier s overall price cap based universal service calculation 
the fcc also sought comment on how to transition away from the current rate of return system in the future 
we will continue to advocate our position for no or reduced regulation with various regulatory agencies 
in some of our states  we have already been successful in reducing or eliminating price regulation on end user services subject to state commission jurisdiction 
federal subsidies have historically been driven by many factors  including the national average cost per local loop nacpl 
the usf icc report order changes how federal subsidies will be calculated and disbursed  with this change being phased in beginning in these changes will transition the federal universal service high cost fund  which supports voice services in high cost areas  to the connect america fund caf  which will support broadband deployment in high cost areas 
caf phase i will be implemented in  and price cap carriers will receive the same amount of support from all usf high cost programs as in in addition  the fcc in caf phase i will make available for price cap ilecs an additional million in incremental high cost broadband support to be used for broadband deployment to unserved areas 
the fcc anticipates that it will replace this interim program with a phase ii caf long term solution in  though the interim program will continue if no such solution is put in place 
frontier will receive a portion of the million caf phase i interim support  although the extent is not yet known 
the usf icc report and order requires carriers receiving the caf phase i interim support to deploy broadband in areas that are currently unserved based on an fcc formula that is currently under reconsideration at the fcc and the outcome of that decision is not yet known 
some states where frontier operates continue to evaluate the manner in which they will determine state subsidy eligibility 
telephone companies are subject to fcc rules governing privacy of certain customer information 
among other things  these rules obligate carriers to implement procedures to protect certain customer information from inappropriate disclosure  obtain customer permission to use certain information in marketing  authenticate customers before disclosing account information  and annually certify compliance with the fcc s rules 
most states have certification requirements that require providers of telecommunications services to obtain authority from the state regulatory commission prior to offering common carrier services 
most of the local exchange companies that are operated by us operate as incumbent carriers in the states in which they operate and are certified in those states to provide local telecommunications services 
state regulatory commissions generally regulate the rates ilecs charge for intrastate services  including rates for intrastate access services paid by providers of intrastate long distance services 
the fcc s usf icc report order  however  removes much of the states authority to set terminating intrastate switched access rates 
this aspect of the usf icc report order has been challenged by certain parties in court 
recent and potential regulatory developments federal legislators  the fcc and state regulators are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies 
on march   the fcc released its national broadband plan 
the national broadband plan proposes a series of actions that could result in additional regulatory requirements for broadband services as well as a series of other regulatory reforms 
the fcc has completed some of the proceedings proposed in the national broadband plan on a broad number of topics  including universal service and intercarrier compensation reform 
there are many outstanding questions regarding future support distributions and intercarrier compensation reform that remain open  the outcome of which may significantly change federal universal service funding and disbursement mechanisms and interstate  intrastate and local intercarrier compensation 
the outcome and timing of these proceedings are unknown and  accordingly  we are unable to predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations 
on november   the fcc adopted an order to reform the federal universal service high cost fund and intercarrier compensation 
intercarrier compensation  which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of traffic  will transition over a number of years beginning in mid to a near zero rate for terminating traffic by carriers will be able to recover a portion of those revenues through end user rates and other replacement support mechanisms 
additionally  the usf icc report order requires voip providers to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic to provide appropriate call information  thus prohibiting so called phantom traffic 
the usf icc report order preempts the states with regard to the regulation of intrastate terminating access rates 
the reform of the universal service fund shifts the existing high cost portion of the fund from supporting voice services to supporting broadband deployment in high cost areas 
the usf icc report order has been challenged by certain parties in court and certain parties have also petitioned the fcc to reconsider various aspects of the usf icc report order 
accordingly  frontier cannot predict the long term impact at this time but believes that the usf icc report order will provide a stable regulatory framework to facilitate frontier s ongoing focus on the deployment of broadband into its rural markets 
the fcc also has an ongoing proceeding considering whether to make changes in its regulatory regime governing special access services  including whether to mandate lower rates  change standards for deregulation and pricing flexibility  or to require changes to other terms and conditions 
when and how these proposed changes will be addressed are unknown and  accordingly  we are unable to predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations 
however  future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have the same level of associated variable expenses 
both switched access and subsidy revenues continued to decline in  as compared to  and are likely to decline further in certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation 
in addition  we have been approached by  and or are involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states 
although the fcc has pre empted state jurisdiction on certain access charges  many states are still considering moving forward with their proceedings 
we cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues 
however  future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses 
regulators at both the federal and state levels continue to address whether voip services are subject to the same or different regulatory and intercarrier compensation regimes as traditional voice telephony 
the fcc  through the usf icc report order  has determined that voip originated traffic terminating on the public switched telephone network is subject to interstate access rates 
the fcc declined to address other voip related issues 
the fcc has stated its intent to address open questions regarding the treatment of voip services in its ongoing ip enabled services proceeding 
internet telephony may have an advantage in the marketplace over our traditional services if it remains less regulated 
in past years  some state regulators have in the past considered imposing on regulated companies including us cash management practices that could limit the ability of a company to transfer cash among its subsidiaries or to its parent company 
none of the existing state requirements materially affect our cash management  but future changes by state regulators could affect our ability to freely transfer cash within our consolidated companies 
current and potential internet regulatory obligations in connection with our internet access offerings  we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the internet 
there is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services 
as the significance of the internet expands  federal  state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations  or apply existing laws and regulations to the internet including internet access services  and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict whether the outcome of pending or future proceedings will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position 
the fcc adopted orders which put wireline broadband internet access service  commonly delivered by dsl or fiber technology  as well as mobile wireless based broadband internet access service and other forms of broadband internet access services on an equal regulatory footing with cable modem service 
this approach is consistent with a united states supreme court decision upholding the fcc s classification of cable modem services as information services not subject to mandatory common carriage regulation 
specifically  the fcc has determined that these information services are functionally integrated with any underlying telecommunications component  and that there is no obligation to separate out and offer that transmission component subject to common carriage regulation 
the fcc has imposed particular regulatory obligations on broadband services 
for example  it has concluded that voip and facilities based broadband internet access providers must comply with the communications assistance for law enforcement act  a decision that the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit has upheld 
the fcc has also required voip providers to provide enhanced emergency calling capabilities 
in october  the fcc issued a proposed rulemaking looking at rules to preserve a free and open internet  including a reconsideration of the legal classification of broadband and proposed restrictions on broadband network management practices 
on december   the fcc adopted an order imposing some regulations on internet service providers 
these regulations affect fixed and mobile broadband providers differently 
these regulations became effective november   and frontier is in compliance with these regulations 
these regulations are currently subject to court challenge by multiple parties  and the outcome and its effect on frontier is unknown 
video programming 
federal  state and local governments extensively regulate the video services industry 
our fiber optic video service is subject to  among other things  subscriber privacy regulations  requirements that we carry a local broadcast station or obtain consent to carry a local or distant broadcast station  rules for franchise renewals and transfers  the manner in which program packages are marketed to subscribers  and program access requirements 
we provide video programming  on a limited basis  in oregon  washington and indiana pursuant to franchises  permits and similar authorizations issued by local franchising authorities utilizing fiber optic delivery transport to the home 
most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach 
in addition  most franchises require payment of a franchise fee as a requirement to the granting of authority 
many franchises establish comprehensive facilities and service requirements  as well as specific customer service standards and monetary penalties for non compliance 
in many cases  franchises are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provisions set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operations 
franchises are generally granted for fixed terms of at least ten years and must be periodically renewed 
local franchising authorities may resist granting a renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate 
for information regarding approvals by local franchising authorities in connection with the transactions  see regulatory environment regulation of our business 
environmental regulation like all other local telephone companies  the local exchange carrier subsidiaries we operated are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  disposal of  and exposure to hazardous materials  the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination 
as an owner and former owner of property  we are subject to environmental laws that could impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup at contaminated sites  including sites formerly owned by us or the acquired business  regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the activity that resulted in contamination 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
segment information we currently operate in only one reportable segment 
financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales we have no foreign operations 
general order backlog is not a significant consideration in our business 
we have no material contracts or subcontracts that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the federal government 
intellectual property we believe that we have the trademarks  trade names and intellectual property licenses that are necessary for the operation of our business 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately  of our employees are affiliated with a union 
the number of union employees covered by collective bargaining agreements expiring during is approximately  we consider our relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors before you make an investment decision with respect to any of our securities  you should carefully consider all the information we have included or incorporated by reference in this form k and our subsequent periodic filings with the sec 
in particular  you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and read the risks and uncertainties related to forward looking statements which we do not undertake to update as set forth in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this form k  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions  may also adversely affect our business and operations 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with md a and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
risks related to our business we will likely face further reductions in access lines  switched access minutes of use  long distance revenues and federal and state subsidy revenues  which could adversely affect us 
we have experienced declining access lines  switched access minutes of use  long distance revenues  federal and state subsidies and related revenues because of economic conditions  increasing competition  changing consumer behavior such as wireless displacement of wireline use  e mail use  instant messaging and increasing use of voip  technology changes and regulatory constraints 
for example  frontier s access lines declined in and in on a full year pro forma basis 
in addition  frontier s switched access minutes of use declined in and declined in on a full year pro forma basis 
we will likely continue to experience reductions in the future 
the factors referred to above  among others  are likely to cause our local network service  switched network access  long distance and subsidy revenues to continue to decline  and these factors may cause our cash generated by operations to decrease 
we face intense competition  which could adversely affect us 
the communications industry is extremely competitive and competition is increasing 
the traditional dividing lines between local  long distance  wireless  cable and internet service providers are becoming increasingly blurred 
through mergers and various service expansion strategies  service providers are striving to provide integrated solutions both within and across geographic markets 
our competitors include competitive local exchange carriers and other providers or potential providers of services  such as internet service providers  wireless companies  voip providers and cable companies that may provide services competitive with the services that we offer or intend to introduce 
we also believe that wireless and cable telephony providers have increased their penetration of various services in our markets 
we expect that we will continue to lose access lines and that competition with respect to all of our products and services will increase 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the entrance of new competitors  penetration of existing competitors into new markets  changing consumer behavior and the development of new technologies  products and services that can be used in substitution for our products and services 
we cannot predict which of the many possible future technologies  products or services will be important in order to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures will be required to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on the success of capital expenditure investments in our territories  in addition to our new marketing efforts  our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including a changing regulatory environment that may affect our business and that of our competitors differently  new services that may be introduced including wireless broadband offerings  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and pricing strategies by competitors 
increasing competition may reduce our revenues and increase our marketing and other costs as well as require us to increase our capital expenditures and thereby decrease our cash flow 
some of our competitors have superior resources  which may place us at a cost and price disadvantage 
some of our competitors have market presence  engineering  technical and marketing capabilities and financial  personnel and other resources substantially greater than ours 
in addition  some of these competitors are able to raise capital at a lower cost than we are able to 
consequently  some of these competitors may be able to develop and expand their communications and network infrastructures more quickly  adapt more swiftly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we will be able to 
additionally  the greater brand name recognition of some competitors may require us to price our services at lower levels in order to retain or obtain customers 
finally  the cost advantages of some of these competitors may give them the ability to reduce their prices for an extended period of time if they so choose 
we may be unable to grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we have implemented 
we must produce adequate revenues and cash flows that  when combined with funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to service our debt  fund our capital expenditures  pay our taxes  fund our pension and other employee benefit obligations and pay dividends pursuant to our dividend policy 
we have identified some potential areas of opportunity and implemented several growth initiatives  including increasing marketing promotions and related expenditures and launching new products and services with a focus on areas that are growing or demonstrate meaningful demand  such as wireline and wireless hsi  satellite video products  and the frontier secure suite of products  which includes computer technical support 
we cannot assure you that these opportunities will be successful or that these initiatives will improve our financial position or our results of operations 
weak economic conditions may decrease demand for our services or necessitate increased discounts 
we could be adversely impacted if current economic conditions or their effects continue 
downturns in the economy and competition in our markets could cause some of our customers to reduce or eliminate their purchases of our basic and enhanced services  hsi and video services and make it difficult for us to obtain new customers 
in addition  if current economic conditions continue  our customers may delay or discontinue payment for our services or seek more competitive pricing from other service providers  or we may be required to offer increased discounts in order to retain our customers 
disruption in our networks  infrastructure and information technology may cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses 
to attract and retain customers  we must provide reliable service 
some of the risks to our networks  infrastructure and information technology include physical damage  security breaches  capacity limitations  power surges or outages  software defects and other disruptions beyond our control  such as natural disasters and acts of terrorism 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we experience short disruptions in our service due to factors such as cable damage  theft of our equipment  inclement weather and service failures of our third party service providers 
we could experience more significant disruptions in the future 
we could also face disruptions due to capacity limitations if changes in our customers usage patterns for our hsi services result in a significant increase in capacity utilization  such as through increased usage of video or peer to peer file sharing applications 
disruptions may cause interruptions in service or reduced capacity for customers  either of which could cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses  and thereby adversely affect our business  revenues and cash flows 
our business is sensitive to the creditworthiness of our wholesale customers 
we have substantial business relationships with other telecommunications carriers for whom we provide service 
while bankruptcies of these carriers have not had a material adverse effect on our business in recent years  future bankruptcies in the industry could result in the loss of significant customers by us  as well as cause more price competition and uncollectible accounts receivable 
such bankruptcies may be more likely in the future if current economic conditions continue through or beyond 
as a result  our revenues and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions and is therefore subject to collective bargaining agreements  if we are unable to enter into new agreements or renew existing agreements before they expire  our workers subject to collective bargaining agreements could engage in strikes or other labor actions that could materially disrupt our ability to provide services to our customers 
as of december   we had approximately  active employees 
approximately  or  of these employees were represented by unions and were therefore subject to collective bargaining agreements 
of the union represented employees as of december   approximately  or  are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expire in and approximately  or  are subject to collective bargaining agreements that expire in we cannot predict the outcome of negotiations of the collective bargaining agreements covering our employees 
if we are unable to reach new agreements or renew existing agreements  employees subject to collective bargaining agreements may engage in strikes  work slowdowns or other labor actions  which could materially disrupt our ability to provide services 
new labor agreements or the renewal of existing agreements may impose significant new costs on us  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
if we are unable to hire or retain key personnel  we may be unable to operate our business successfully 
our success will depend in part upon the continued services of our management 
we cannot guarantee that our key personnel will not leave or compete with us 
the loss  incapacity or unavailability for any reason of key members of our management team could have a material impact on our business 
in addition  our financial results and our ability to compete will suffer should we become unable to attract  integrate or retain other qualified personnel in the future 
our efforts to integrate our legacy business and the acquired business may not be successful 
the acquisition of the acquired business was the largest and most significant acquisition we have undertaken 
our management has been and will continue to be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating the operations of our legacy business and the acquired business  which may decrease the time management will have to serve existing customers  attract new customers and develop new services or strategies 
the size and complexity of the acquired business and the use of our existing common support functions and systems to manage the acquired business  if not managed successfully  may result in interruptions in our activities  a decrease in the quality of our services  a deterioration in our employee and customer relationships  increased costs of integration and harm to our reputation  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the growth opportunities that we anticipated from the transaction 
the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the acquisition of the acquired business will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities 
our success in realizing these growth opportunities and the timing of this realization  depends on the successful integration of our legacy business and operations and the acquired business and operations 
even if we are able to complete the integration of the businesses and operations successfully  this integration may not result in the realization of the full benefits of the growth opportunities that we currently expect from this integration 
moreover  we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with the integration of our legacy business and the acquired business 
through december   we have incurred million in integration expenses and capital expenditures  and we anticipate that additional expenditures will be incurred in to complete the integration 
accordingly  the benefits from the transaction may be partially offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses 
regulatory authorities  in connection with their approval of the acquisition  imposed on us certain conditions relating to our capital expenditures and business operations which may adversely affect our financial performance 
in connection with granting their approvals of the transaction  the fcc and certain state regulatory commissions specified certain capital expenditure and operating requirements for the acquired territories for specified periods of time post closing 
these requirements focus primarily on certain capital investment commitments to expand broadband availability to at least of the households throughout the acquired territories with minimum speeds of megabits per second mbps by the end of and mbps by the end of to satisfy all or part of certain capital investment commitments to three state regulatory commissions  we placed an aggregate amount of million in cash into escrow accounts and obtained a letter of credit for million in another million of cash in an escrow account with a cash balance of million and an associated liability of million as of december  was acquired in connection with the transaction to be used for service quality initiatives in the state of west virginia 
as of december   we had a restricted cash balance in these escrow accounts in the aggregate amount of million 
as of such date  million had been released from escrow 
as of december   the letter of credit has been reduced to million 
in addition  in certain states  we are subject to operating restrictions such as rate caps including maintenance of the rates on residential and business products and the prices and terms of interconnection agreements with competitive local exchange carriers and arrangements with carriers that  in each case  existed as of the time of the acquisition  continuation of product bundle offerings that we offered before the transaction  waiver of certain customer early termination fees and restrictions on others  restrictions on caps on usage of broadband capacity  and certain minimum service quality standards for a defined period of time the failure of which to meet  in one state  will result in penalties  including cash management limitations on certain of our subsidiaries in that one state 
in one other state  our subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends that can be paid to the parent company for a period ending on june  we are also required to report certain financial information and adhere for a period of time to certain conditions regulating competition and consumer protection 
the foregoing conditions may restrict our ability to expend cash for other uses and to modify the operations of our business in response to changing circumstances for a period of time 
most of the acquired business operates on systems acquired from verizon  which are not as flexible as our legacy systems 
currently  certain functions of the acquired business in nine states are operated on verizon replicated information systems  which are not as flexible as ours and restrict our ability to quickly react to our customers needs 
until such systems are fully converted  which is currently scheduled to commence in march  our ability to launch new products and promotions in these acquired territories on a timely basis may be limited  which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
if the transaction does not qualify as tax free under section of the internal revenue code the code  including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of frontier  then verizon or verizon stockholders may be required to pay substantial us federal income taxes  and we may be obligated to indemnify verizon for such taxes imposed on verizon or verizon stockholders 
the transaction would be taxable to verizon pursuant to section e of the code if there is a or more change in ownership of the acquired business  directly or indirectly  as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the transaction 
because verizon stockholders collectively owned more than of the frontier common stock following the transaction  the transaction alone did not result in a tax to verizon under section e 
however  section e might apply if other acquisitions of stock of frontier after the transaction are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the spin off 
if section e applies  verizon might recognize a substantial amount of taxable gain and we may be liable to indemnify verizon 
under a tax sharing agreement  in certain circumstances  and subject to certain limitations  we are required to indemnify verizon against taxes on the transaction that arise as a result of actions or failures to act by us  or as a result of changes in ownership of our stock after the transaction 
see we will be unable to take certain actions until july because such actions could jeopardize the tax free status of the transaction  and such restrictions could be significant 
we will be unable to take certain actions until july because such actions could jeopardize the tax free status of the transaction  and such restrictions could be significant 
the tax sharing agreement prohibits us from taking actions that could reasonably be expected to cause the transaction to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the irs ruling or opinions of counsel received by verizon or frontier 
in particular  for two years after the spin off  or until july  we may not enter into any agreement  understanding or arrangement or engage in any substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction involving the acquisition  issuance  repurchase or change of ownership of frontier capital stock  or options or other rights in respect of frontier capital stock  subject to certain exceptions relating to employee compensation arrangements  stock splits  open market stock repurchases and stockholder rights plans  permit certain wholly owned subsidiaries owned by the acquired business at the time of the transaction to cease the active conduct of the acquired business to the extent it was conducted immediately prior to the transaction  or voluntarily dissolve  liquidate  merge or consolidate with any other person  unless we survive and the transaction otherwise complies with the restrictions in the tax sharing agreement 
nevertheless  we will be permitted to take any of the actions described above if we obtain verizon s consent  or if we obtain a supplemental irs private letter ruling or an opinion of counsel that is reasonably acceptable to verizon to the effect that the action will not affect the tax free status of the transaction 
however  the receipt of any such consent  opinion or ruling does not relieve us of any obligation we have to indemnify verizon for an action we take that causes the transaction to be taxable to verizon 
because of these restrictions  until july  we may be limited in the amount of capital stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital 
also  our indemnity obligation to verizon may discourage  delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us during this period in a transaction that the holders of our securities might consider favorable 
we may complete a future significant strategic transaction that may not achieve intended results or could increase the number of our outstanding shares or amount of outstanding debt or result in a change of control 
we continuously evaluate and may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions 
any such transaction could happen at any time  could be material to our business and could take any number of forms  including  for example  an acquisition  merger or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
evaluating potential transactions and integrating completed ones may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters 
the success of these potential transactions will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing business 
even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses  we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames 
in addition  acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies 
if we complete an acquisition  investment or other strategic transaction  we may require additional financing that could result in an increase in the number of our outstanding shares or the aggregate amount of our debt  although there are restrictions on our ability to issue additional shares of stock for these purposes until july see we will be unable to take certain actions until july because such actions could jeopardize the tax free status of the transaction  and such restrictions could be significant 
the number of shares of our common stock or the aggregate principal amount of our debt that we may issue may be significant 
a strategic transaction may result in a change in control of our company or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business 
risks related to liquidity  financial resources and capitalization if the lingering impact of the ongoing economic uncertainty continues through  it may have an impact on our business and financial condition 
disruption and uncertainty in the capital markets  and tightening of credit availability may continue through this economic scenario may affect the financial health of our customers  vendors and partners  which in turn may negatively affect our revenues  operating expenses and cash flows 
in addition  we have a million revolving credit facility 
although we believe  based on currently available information  that the financial institutions with commitments under the revolving credit facility will be able to fulfill their commitments to us  as applicable  we cannot be certain of this in the future 
volatility in asset values related to frontier s pension plan may require us to make contributions to fund pension plan liabilities 
frontier s pension plan assets have decreased from  million at december   to  million at december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is a result of ongoing benefit payments of million offset by million of positive investment returns and contributions of cash and real property of million during the company expects to make contributions of approximately million in volatility in our asset values or returns may require us to make additional contributions in future years 
substantial debt and debt service obligations may adversely affect us 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which amounted to approximately billion at december  we have access to a million revolving credit facility and may also obtain additional long term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs  subject to certain restrictions under the terms of our existing indebtedness 
despite the substantial indebtedness that we have  we are not prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness 
the potential significant negative consequences on our financial condition and results of operations that could result from our substantial debt include limitations on our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing  instances in which we are unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to make required debt payments  which circumstances have the potential of accelerating the maturity of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness  the allocation of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt  thus reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purposes  including operating costs  capital expenditures and dividends that would otherwise improve our competitive position  results of operations or stock price  requiring us to sell debt or equity securities or to sell some of our core assets  possibly on unfavorable terms  to meet payment obligations  compromising our flexibility to plan for  or react to  competitive challenges in our business and the communications industry  and the possibility of our being put at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who do not have as much debt as us  and competitors who may be in a more favorable position to access additional capital resources 
in addition  our senior notes are rated below investment grade by independent ratings agencies 
this can result in higher borrowing costs for us 
we cannot assure you that these rating agencies will not lower our current debt ratings  if in the rating agencies judgment  such an action is appropriate 
a lowering of a rating may further increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital 
we will require substantial capital to upgrade and enhance our operations 
the acquired business historical capital expenditures  excluding expenditures relating to the fiber to the home network  were significantly lower than our level of capital expenditures for our legacy operations when compared on a per access line basis 
replacing or upgrading our infrastructure will require significant capital expenditures  including any expected or unexpected expenditures necessary to make replacements or upgrades to the existing infrastructure of the acquired business 
if this capital is not available when needed or required as a result of the regulatory approval process in connection with the transaction  our business will be adversely affected 
responding to increases in competition  offering new services  and improving the capabilities of  or reducing the maintenance costs associated with  our plant may cause our capital expenditures to increase in the future 
accelerated losses of access lines  the effects of increased competition  lower subsidy and access revenues and the other factors described above may reduce our cash generated by operations and may require us to increase capital expenditures 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue paying dividends 
effective february   our board of directors set the annual cash dividend at per share  a reduction from our prior dividend level of per share 
however  the amount and timing of future dividend payments is subject to applicable law and will be made at the discretion of our board of directors based on factors such as cash flow and cash requirements  capital expenditure requirements  financial condition and other factors 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries risks related to regulation changes in federal or state regulations may reduce the switched access charge revenues we receive 
a significant portion of frontier s total revenues approximately million  or  in and approximately million  or  in are derived from switched access charges paid by other carriers for services that frontier legacy operations or the acquired business  as the case may be  provides or provided in originating and terminating intrastate and interstate long distance traffic 
as a result  frontier expects a significant portion of the company s revenues will continue to be derived from switched access charges paid by these carriers for services that the company will provide in originating and terminating this traffic 
the amount of switched access charge revenues that the company will receive for these services is regulated by the fcc and state regulatory agencies 
on november   the fcc adopted the usf icc report order 
intercarrier compensation  which is the payment framework that governs how carriers compensate each other for the exchange of traffic  will transition over a number of years beginning in mid to a near zero rate for terminating traffic by carriers will be able to recover a portion of those revenues through end user rates and other replacement support mechanisms 
additionally  the order requires voip providers to pay interstate terminating interconnection charges and requires all carriers terminating traffic to provide appropriate call information  thus prohibiting so called phantom traffic 
the order preempts the states with regard to the regulation of intrastate terminating access rates 
the reform of the universal service fund shifts the existing high cost portion of the fund from supporting voice services to supporting broadband deployment in high cost areas 
the usf icc report order has been challenged by certain parties in court and certain parties have also petitioned the fcc to reconsider various aspects of the order 
accordingly  although we believe that the usf icc report order will provide a stable regulatory framework to facilitate frontier s ongoing focus on the deployment of broadband into its rural markets  frontier cannot predict the long term impact at this time 
the fcc also has an ongoing proceeding considering whether to make changes to its regulatory regime governing special access services 
when and how these proposed changes will be addressed is unknown and  accordingly  frontier cannot predict the impact of future changes on the company s results of operations 
certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation 
in addition  frontier has been approached by  and or is involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states 
although the fcc has pre empted state jurisdiction on certain access charges  many states are still considering moving forward with their proceedings 
frontier cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on the company s subsidy or switched access revenues 
however  future reductions in the company s subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect the company s profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses 
we are reliant on support funds provided under federal and state laws 
a significant portion of frontier s total revenues approximately million in the aggregate  or  in and approximately million in the aggregate  or  in are derived from federal and state subsidies for rural and high cost support  commonly referred to as universal service fund subsidies 
the usf icc report order changes how federal subsidies will be calculated and disbursed  with this change being phased in beginning in these changes will transition the federal universal service high cost fund  which supports voice service in high cost areas  to the connect america fund caf  which will support broadband deployment in unserved and underserved high cost areas 
as part of this transition  in price cap carriers will receive the same amount of support from all usf high cost programs as in as part of the caf phase i implementation  the fcc will make available for price cap ilecs an additional million in interim incremental high cost broadband support for broadband deployment to unserved areas 
the fcc anticipates that it will replace this interim program with a phase ii caf long term solution in  though the interim program may continue if no solution is put in place 
frontier will receive a portion of the million caf phase i interim support  although the extent is not yet known 
the usf icc report and order requires carriers receiving the interim support to deploy broadband in areas that are currently unserved based on a formula that will expect deployment to a certain number of new locations 
the exact formula is currently under reconsideration at the fcc and the outcome of that decision is not yet known 
some states where frontier operates continue to evaluate the manner in which they will determine state subsidy eligibility 
federal subsidies representing interstate access support  high cost loop support and local switching support represented approximately million  or  or frontier s total revenues in and approximately million  or  or frontier s total revenues in state subsidies represented approximately million  or  of frontier s total revenues in and approximately million  or less than  in approximately million  or  of frontier s total revenues in and approximately million  or in  represent a surcharge to customers local  long distance and interconnection to recover universal service fund contribution fees which are remitted to the fcc and recorded as an expense in other operating expenses 
our company and our industry will likely remain highly regulated  and we could incur substantial compliance costs that could constrain our ability to compete in our target markets 
as an incumbent local exchange carrier  some of the services we offer are subject to significant regulation from federal  state and local authorities 
this regulation could impact our ability to change our rates  especially on our basic voice services and our access rates  and could impose substantial compliance costs on us 
regulation could constrain our ability to compete and  in some jurisdictions  may restrict our ability to expand our service offerings 
in addition  changes to the regulations that govern our business including any implementation of the usf icc report order may have an adverse effect on our business by reducing the allowable fees that we may charge  imposing additional compliance costs  reducing the amount of subsidies or otherwise changing the nature of our operations and the competition in our industry 
at this time it is unknown how these regulations will affect frontier s operations or ability to compete in the future 
this and other fcc rulemakings and state regulatory proceedings  including those relating to intercarrier compensation  universal service and broadband services  could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations 
in addition  in connection with our internet access offerings  we could become subject to laws and regulations as they are adopted or applied to the internet 
there is currently only limited regulation applicable to these services 
as the significance of the internet expands  federal  state and local governments may pass laws and adopt rules and regulations  or apply existing laws and regulations to the internet including internet access services  and related matters are under consideration in both federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies 
we cannot predict whether the outcome of pending or future proceedings will prove beneficial or detrimental to our competitive position 
risks related to technology in the future  as competition intensifies within our markets  we may be unable to meet the technological needs or expectations of our customers  and may lose customers as a result 
the communications industry is subject to significant changes in technology 
if we do not replace or upgrade technology and equipment  we may be unable to compete effectively because we will not be able to meet the needs or expectations of our customers 
replacing or upgrading the combined infrastructure could result in significant capital expenditures 
in addition  rapidly changing technology in the communications industry may influence our customers to consider other service providers 
for example  we may be unable to retain customers who decide to totally replace their wireline telephone service with wireless telephone service 
we may be unable to attract or retain new customers from cable companies due to their deployment of enhanced broadband and voip technology 
in addition  new capacity services for wireless broadband technologies may permit our competitors to offer broadband data services to our customers throughout most or all of our service areas 
our internet services could be adversely affected and we may be subject to increased costs and claims in connection with internet and systems security and malicious internet practices 
we use encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide secure transmission of confidential information  including our business data and customer information 
we also rely on employees in our network operations centers  data centers  call centers and retail stores to follow our procedures when handling such information 
any unauthorized access  computer viruses  accidental or intentional release of confidential information or other disruptions could result in increased costs  customer dissatisfaction leading to loss of customers and revenues  and fines and other liabilities 
in addition  our company or our customers using our network to access the internet may become victim to malicious and abusive internet activities  including unsolicited mass advertising spam  peer to peer file sharing  distribution of viruses  worms and other destructive or disruptive software 
these activities could adversely affect our network  result in excessive call volume at our call centers and damage our or our customers equipment and data

expected cost savings resulting from the transaction based on current estimates and assumptions  we expect to achieve additional cost savings as a result of the transaction  principally by leveraging the scalability of our existing corporate administrative functions  information technology and network systems to cover certain former acquired business functions and systems  by in sourcing certain functions formerly provided by third party service providers to the acquired business and by achieving improved efficiencies and more favorable rates with third party vendors 
we estimate that our annualized cost savings will reach approximately million by the end of our savings from our targeted initiatives list which includes  but is not limited to  network cost savings  contractor reductions  cancellation or reduction of vendor services  benefit changes and real estate savings was approximately million  or million on an annualized basis  and combined with the savings achieved in of approximately million  or million on an annualized basis  equates to an annualized cost savings run rate of approximately million as of the end of the foregoing future cost savings are based on our estimates and assumptions that  although we consider them reasonable  are inherently uncertain 
significant business  economic  competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control  may affect these expected cost savings 
see forward looking statements above 
as a result  there can be no assurance that these or any other future cost savings or synergies will actually be realized 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries a liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million excluding restricted cash of million  representing funds escrowed for future broadband expansion and service quality initiatives 
our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations 
for the year ended december   we used cash flow from operations  cash on hand and debt proceeds to fund all of our cash investing and financing activities  primarily capital expenditures  dividends and debt payments 
the consummation of the transaction resulted in a combined company with significantly larger business operations and  consequently  greater working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs 
upon consummation of the transaction  we assumed approximately billion principal amount of debt 
as a result of our greater liquidity requirements  we entered into a new revolving credit facility which increased our line of credit to million to provide sufficient flexibility to meet our liquidity needs 
as of december   we had not made any borrowings utilizing this facility 
based on the level of debt incurred and the additional cash flows resulting from the transaction  our capacity to service our debt has been significantly enhanced as compared to our capacity immediately prior to the transaction  although our overall debt increased 
at december   we had a working capital surplus of million 
we believe our operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and existing revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  make required debt payments  pay taxes  pay dividends to our stockholders  pay our integration costs and capital expenditures  and support our short term and long term operating strategies through effective february   our board of directors set the annual cash dividend at per share 
the board reduced the dividend in order to strengthen our balance sheet and improve operational and financial flexibility 
however  a number of factors  including but not limited to  losses of access lines  pricing pressure from increased competition  lower subsidy and switched access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated from operations 
in addition  although we believe  based on information available to us  that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us  this could change in the future 
as of december   we had approximately million and million of debt maturing in and  respectively 
in addition  the fcc and certain state regulatory commissions  in connection with granting their approvals of the transaction  specified certain capital expenditure and operating requirements for the acquired territories for specified periods of time post closing 
these requirements focus primarily on certain capital investment commitments to expand broadband availability to at least of the households throughout the acquired territories with minimum speeds of mbps by the end of and mbps by the end of to satisfy all or part of certain capital investment commitments to three state regulatory commissions  we placed an aggregate amount of million in cash into escrow accounts and obtained a letter of credit for million in another million of cash in an escrow account with a cash balance of million and an associated liability of million as of december  was acquired in connection with the transaction to be used for service quality initiatives in the state of west virginia 
as of december   million had been released from escrow 
as of december   the letter of credit had been reduced to million 
the aggregate amount of these escrow accounts and the letter of credit has decreased and will continue to decrease over time as frontier makes the required capital expenditures in the respective states 
cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows provided by operating activities improved million  or  in as compared to the improvement was primarily the result of the additional six months of cash flow from the acquired business during cash refunds net of cash taxes paid for taxes of million were received in  while cash paid for taxes was million and million in and  respectively 
our cash taxes reflect the continued impact of bonus depreciation under the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization  and job creation act of we expect that in our cash taxes will be approximately million 
in the third quarter of  the company contributed four administrative properties appraised at million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan 
the company is leasing back the properties from its pension plan for years at a combined aggregate annual rent of approximately million 
the properties are managed on behalf of the pension plan by an independent fiduciary  and the terms of the leases were negotiated with the fiduciary on an arm s length basis

capital expenditures in and included million and million  respectively  associated with the acquired business 
we continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects  emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction 
we anticipate capital expenditures for business operations to be approximately million to million for and capital expenditures for our final integration activities in to be approximately million

the senior notes were issued at a price equal to of their face value 
in the third quarter of  we completed an exchange offer for the privately placed senior notes for registered notes 
upon completion of the transaction  we also assumed additional debt of million  including million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due october  other debt financings on october   we completed a registered offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due the issue price was of the principal amount of the notes  and we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses

we may also refinance existing debt or exchange existing debt for newly issued debt obligations 
frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries credit facility we have a million revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had not made any borrowings utilizing this facility 
the terms of the credit facility are set forth in the revolving credit agreement  dated as of march   among the company  the lenders party thereto  and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent the revolving credit agreement 
associated facility fees under the credit facility will vary from time to time depending on the company s credit rating as defined in the revolving credit agreement and were per annum as of december  the credit facility is scheduled to terminate on january  during the term of the credit facility  the company may borrow  repay and reborrow funds  and may obtain letters of credit  subject to customary borrowing conditions

letters of credit issued under the credit facility will also be subject to fees that vary depending on the company s credit rating 
the credit facility will be available for general corporate purposes but may not be used to fund dividend payments 
letter of credit facility we also have a million unsecured letter of credit facility 
the terms of the letter of credit facility are set forth in a credit agreement  dated as of september   among the company  the lenders party thereto  and deutsche bank ag  new york branch the bank  as administrative agent and issuing bank the letter of credit agreement 
an initial letter of credit for million was issued to the west virginia public service commission to guarantee certain of our capital investment commitments in west virginia in connection with the transaction 
the initial commitments under the letter of credit agreement expired on september   with the bank exercising its option to extend million of the commitments to september  the company is required to pay an annual facility fee on the available commitment  regardless of usage 
the covenants binding on the company under the terms of the letter of credit agreement are substantially similar to those in the company s other credit facilities  including limitations on liens  substantial asset sales and mergers  subject to customary exceptions and thresholds 
covenants the terms and conditions contained in our indentures  the credit agreement  the revolving credit agreement and the letter of credit agreement include the timely payment of principal and interest when due  the maintenance of our corporate existence  keeping proper books and records in accordance with us gaap  restrictions on the incurrence of liens on our assets  and restrictions on asset sales and transfers  mergers and other changes in corporate control 
we are not subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends either by contract  rule or regulation  other than that imposed by the general corporation law of the state of delaware 
however  we would be restricted under the credit agreement  the revolving credit agreement and the letter of credit agreement from declaring dividends if an event of default occurred and was continuing at the time or would result from the dividend declaration 
the credit agreement and the revolving credit agreement each contain a maximum leverage ratio covenant 
under those covenants  we are required to maintain a ratio of i total indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash in excess of million to ii consolidated adjusted ebitda as defined in the agreements over the last four quarters no greater than to at december   the ratio of our net debt to adjusted operating cash flow leverage ratio was times

as of december   we were in compliance with all of our debt and credit facility covenants 
dividends we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends 
effective february   our board of directors has set the annual cash dividend rate at per share 
our ability to fund a regular quarterly dividend will be impacted by our ability to generate cash from operations 
the declarations and payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors  and will depend upon many factors  including our financial condition  results of operations  growth prospects  funding requirements  applicable law  restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness and other factors our board of directors deem relevant 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities 
future commitments a summary of our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  is as follows contractual obligations in thousands payment due by period total thereafter long term debt obligations  excluding interest interest on long term debt operating lease obligations financing lease obligations purchase obligations liability for uncertain tax positions total at december   we had outstanding performance letters of credit totaling million 
critical accounting policies and estimates we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements  accordingly  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  impairment of intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and purchase price allocations  among others 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of our ability to collect accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to bankruptcies of telecommunications companies or any other customers 
asset impairment we review long lived assets to be held and used  including customer lists  and long lived assets to be disposed of for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair market value 
if any assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value 
also  we periodically reassess the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets to determine whether any changes are required 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments 
intangibles our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name  which resulted from the purchase of ilec properties 
we test for impairment of these assets annually  or more frequently  as circumstances warrant 
we test for goodwill impairment at the operating segment level  as that term is defined in us gaap 
effective with the third quarter of  the company reorganized into six operating segments in order to leverage the full benefits of its local engagement model 
the six operating segments consist of the following regions national  northeast  southeast  central  midwest and west 
our operating segments are aggregated into one reportable segment since they have similar economic characteristics 
in conjunction with the reorganization of our operating segments effective with the third quarter of  we reassigned goodwill to our reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach 
this structure is consistent with how our chief operating decision makers ceo  cfo  coo review our results on a daily  weekly and monthly basis 
after making the change in our operating segments  we reviewed our goodwill impairment test by comparing the ebitda multiples for each reporting unit to their carrying values noting that no impairment indicator was present 
no potential impairment was indicated and no further analysis was deemed necessary 
our annual goodwill impairment testing date is december each of the operating segments is also a reporting unit 
the first step in the goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit to its fair value 
the result of this first step indicated that fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units 
as a result  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
goodwill by reporting unit operating segment at december  is as follows reporting units in thousands east southeast west central national midwest goodwill enterprise values for rural ilec properties are typically quoted as a multiple of cash flow or ebitda 
marketplace company comparisons and analyst reports support a range of values around a multiple of to times annualized ebitda 
for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test we define ebitda as operating income  net of acquisition and integration costs  non cash pension opeb costs and severance and early retirement costs  plus depreciation and amortization 
we determined the fair value estimates using times ebitda but also used lower ebitda multiples to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess of fair value over the carrying values of the reporting units 
total fair value determined in this manner is then allocated to the reporting units based upon each unit s relative share of consolidated ebitda 
our method of determining fair value has been consistently applied for the three years ending december  depreciation and amortization the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based upon the estimated useful lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation expense is principally based on the composite group method for substantially all of our property  plant and equipment assets 
given the varying estimated useful lives of our property  plant and equipment assets  the company utilizes multiple asset categories with separately determined composite lives and individual depreciation rates for each asset category 
within the composite group method  we group individual assets  including cable and wire  into asset categories utilizing homogeneous characteristics  where such assets i are principally used in the same manner throughout the company  ii are subject to similar operating conditions and iii have similar estimated useful lives 
examples of the asset categories we utilize include aerial cable copper  aerial cable fiber  aerial cable station connections  underground cable copper and underground cable fiber 
as a result of continuing changes in technology  an independent study is conducted annually to update the estimated remaining useful lives of all individual asset categories 
the annual study includes models that consider actual usage  replacement history and certain assumptions about technology evolution to estimate the remaining useful lives of our asset base by asset category 
an independent study was performed in to determine the estimated remaining useful lives for our acquired business and these new lives were adopted effective july   the acquisition date for those assets 
we revised our estimated remaining useful lives for frontier legacy plant assets  effective october  the composite depreciation rate for for our property  plant and equipment assets was  as a result of this study 
there have been no significant changes to the ranges of estimated useful lives for the individual asset categories  including the cable and wire asset groups  during the three years ended december  the latest study was completed in the fourth quarter of and after review and analysis of the results  we adopted new estimated remaining useful lives for certain plant assets as of october  our composite depreciation rate for plant assets was as a result of this study 
intangible assets acquired in the transaction were recorded at an estimated fair value of billion with an estimated useful life of nine years for the residential customer list  as distinguished from the years used for the business customer list 
for both classes of assets  the sum of the years digits method is used to amortize the intangible assets  which tracks more closely with the projected revenue stream of each asset class 
our frontier legacy customer list intangible assets do not distinguish between residential and business classes and the amortization period is five years on the straight line method 
we periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required 
we anticipate depreciation expense of approximately million to million and amortization expense of approximately million for pension and other postretirement benefits our estimates of pension expense  other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates 
in connection with the completion of the transaction on july   certain employees were transferred from various verizon pension plans into pension plans that were then merged with the frontier communications pension plan the plan effective august  assets of million were transferred into the plan during the second half of and assets of million were transferred into the plan in august the plan has a receivable of million as of december   that will be settled by the transfer of assets in early we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former frontier legacy employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical  dental  life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents 
all of the employees who are still accruing pension benefits are employees represented by unions 
the accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts 
these actuarial assumptions include the following discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover  healthcare cost trend rates  expected retirement age  optional form of benefit and mortality 
we review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries 
we consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions 
the discount rate is used to value  on a present value basis  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations opeb as of the balance sheet date 
the same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year 
the measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term  high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on the citigroup above median pension curve  the towers watson index  the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next 
this rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
our discount rate was for valuation of the year end pension obligations and for valuations of the year end opeb obligations at year end  and at year end the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we considered published surveys of expected market returns  and year actual returns of various major indices  and our own historical year  year and year investment returns 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to in fixed income securities  to in equity securities and to in alternative investments 
we review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate 
our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year 
in  and  our expected long term rate of return on plan assets was 
our actual return on plan assets in was 
for  we will assume a rate of return of 
our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date 
we expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for will be approximately million to million before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures 
in  they were million before amounts capitalized into the cost of capital expenditures 
we expect to make contributions to our pension plan of approximately million in we made contributions to our pension plan of approximately million in  consisting of cash payments of million and the contribution of real property with a fair value of million 
we made cash contributions of million in no contributions were made to our pension plan during income taxes our effective tax rate in decreased to from in the higher rate in was primarily related to the write off of certain deferred tax assets in of approximately million related to transaction costs which were not tax deductible 
prior to the closing of the transaction  these costs were deemed to be tax deductible as the transaction had not yet been successfully completed 
these costs were incurred to facilitate the transaction and once the transaction closed  these costs had to be capitalized for tax purposes 
income taxes for include the reduction of deferred tax balances based on the application of enacted state tax statutes for million and the net reversal of a reserve for uncertain tax positions for million  partially offset by the impact of a million charge resulting from the enactment on may  of the michigan corporate income tax that eliminated certain future tax deductions 
our effective tax rate in approximated the statutory rate 
contingencies we currently do not have any contingencies in excess of million recorded on our books 
purchase price allocation the transaction the allocation of the approximate billion in total consideration to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business is a critical estimate 
the estimates of the fair values assigned to plant  customer list and goodwill  are more fully described in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the estimated expected life of a customer used to amortize the customer list is a critical estimate 
new accounting pronouncements there were no new accounting standards that were adopted by the company in  or that would be adopted in future years  with any material financial statement impact

asu changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and ifrs 
asu also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this new guidance is to be applied prospectively  and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

this new guidance is to be applied retrospectively  and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued asu no 
that defers the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu we do not expect the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

asu  intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
after assessing qualitative factors  if an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  no further testing is necessary 
if an entity determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then the traditional two step goodwill impairment test must be performed 
while asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is permitted

revenue revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local  network access  long distance  data  video and internet services 
such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management  with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts 
revenue for increased  million  or  to  million as compared to excluding the additional six months of revenue of  million attributable to the acquired business  our revenue for decreased million  or as compared to this decline in is a result of decreases in the number of residential and business customers  switched access  video and other revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
revenues from data and internet services  such as hsi  for as compared to grew and increased as a percentage of total revenues  and revenues from voice services  like local and long distance services  and from switched access and subsidy including federal and state subsidies declined and decreased as a percentage of our total revenues 
switched access and subsidy revenue of million represented of our revenues for switched access revenue was million for  or of our revenues  as compared to million for  or of our revenues 
subsidy revenue was million in  or of our revenues  as compared to million in  or of our revenues 
we expect declining revenue trends in switched access and subsidy revenue in consolidated revenue for increased  million  or  to  million as compared to excluding the additional six months of revenue of  million attributable to the acquired business  our revenue decreased million  or  as compared to this decline for our frontier legacy operations in is a result of decreases in the number of residential and business customers  services revenue  switched access revenue  long distance services revenue and directory revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
change in the number of our access lines is one metric that is important to our revenue and profitability 
we lost access lines primarily because of changing consumer behavior including wireless substitution  economic conditions  changing technology  competition  and by the loss of second lines upon the addition of hsi service 
our frontier legacy operations lost approximately  access lines net during  or on an annual basis  comparable to the  access lines net  or on an annual basis  lost during the acquired business lost approximately  access lines net during  or on an annual basis  as compared to the  access lines net  or on an annual basis  lost during the six months ended december  economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our bundled service offerings  and cause us to increase our promotions and or lower our prices for our products and services  which would adversely affect our revenue  profitability and cash flow 
during  the company added approximately  hsi subscribers net 
during the first quarter of  the company announced a price increase implemented in april for fios video customers in the state of indiana who are on month to month plans 
while the company implemented a number of retention promotions  losses of fios video customers occurred during  as did the loss of fios data customers  although the absolute number of losses declined throughout the year 
during  we lost approximately  fios data customers and added approximately  other hsi subscribers 
in connection with the transaction  the company agreed to focus primarily on certain capital investment commitments to expand broadband availability and speeds 
the company plans to significantly expand broadband availability and speed over the next several years 
we expect to continue to increase hsi subscribers in while the number of access lines is an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends  it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate our business 
management believes that customer counts and understanding different components of revenue is most important 
for this reason  presented in the table titled other financial and operating data below is an analysis that presents customer counts  average monthly revenue  products per customer  percentage of customers on price protection plans and churn 
it also categorizes revenue into customer revenue residential and business and regulatory revenue switched access and subsidy revenue 
despite the decline in residential customers and the decline in total access lines  customer revenue all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue for our frontier legacy operations  declined in by only percent as compared to the prior year 
the decline in customers and access lines was partially offset by increased penetration of additional products sold to both residential and business customers  which has increased our average monthly revenue per customer 
a substantial further loss of customers and access lines  combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue  profitability and cash flows to decrease in other financial and operating data as of increase as of increase as of as of december  decrease december  decrease july  december  access lines residential business total access lines hsi subscribers video subscribers for the year ended december  increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease revenue in s residential business customer revenue switched access and subsidy total revenue switched access minutes of use in millions average monthly total revenue per access line frontier legacy total company average monthly customer revenue per access line frontier legacy total company as of or for the as of or for the as of or for the year ended increase year ended increase year ended december  decrease december  decrease december  residential customer metrics customers revenue in s products per residential customer frontier legacy total company average monthly residential revenue per customer frontier legacy total company percent of customers on price protection plans frontier legacy customer monthly churn frontier legacy total company business customer metrics customers revenue in s average monthly business revenue per customer frontier legacy total company products per residential customer primary residential voice line  hsi and video products have a value of long distance  frontier secure  second lines  feature packages and dial up have a value of calculation excludes the mohave cellular limited partnership

switched access and subsidy revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies  including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to the fcc 
subsidy revenue  excluding the additional six months of revenue related to the acquired business  for of million  decreased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to decreased support for local switching  the federal universal service fund and the federal high cost fund

federal subsidies have historically been driven by many factors  including the national average cost per local loop nacpl 
the usf icc report order changes how federal subsidies will be calculated and disbursed  with this change being phased in beginning in these changes will transition the federal universal service high cost fund  which supports voice services in high cost areas  to the connect america fund caf  which will support broadband deployment in high cost areas 
caf phase i will be implemented in  and price cap carriers will receive the same amount of support from all usf high cost programs as in in addition  the fcc in caf phase i will make available for price cap ilecs an additional million in incremental high cost broadband support to be used for broadband deployment to unserved areas 
the fcc anticipates that it will replace this interim program with a phase ii caf long term solution in  though the interim program will continue if no such solution is put in place 
frontier will receive a portion of the million caf phase i interim support  although the extent is not yet known 
the usf icc report and order requires carriers receiving the caf phase i interim support to deploy broadband in areas that are currently unserved based on an fcc formula that is currently under reconsideration at the fcc and the outcome of that decision is not yet known 
some states where frontier operates continue to evaluate the manner in which they will determine state subsidy eligibility 
certain states also have their own open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation 
in addition  we have been approached by  and or are involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states 
although the fcc has pre empted state jurisdiction on certain access charges  many states are still considering moving forward with their proceedings 
we cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or switched access revenues 
however  future reductions in our subsidy or switched access revenues may directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have an equal level of associated variable expenses

frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities  including those associated with our pension assets 
market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a result  we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks  and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our pension investment portfolio and related obligations  and floating rate indebtedness 
our long term debt as of december  was approximately fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes 
we had no interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt in effect at december  and our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  all but million of our outstanding borrowings at december  have fixed interest rates 
in addition  our undrawn million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with libor  as defined 
consequently  we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
an adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable rate obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure at december   a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure at december   the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately billion  based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately years 
as of december   there has been no material change in the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations since december  equity price exposure our exposure to market risks for changes in equity security prices as of december  is limited to our pension assets 
we have no other security investments of any material amount 
the company s pension plan assets have decreased from  million at december  to  million at december   a decrease of million  or 
this decrease is a result of ongoing benefit payments of million offset by million of positive investment returns and million of cash and real property contributions  consisting of cash payments of million and the contribution of real property with a fair value of million 
we expect that we will make contributions to our pension plan of approximately million in frontier communications corporation and subsidiaries
