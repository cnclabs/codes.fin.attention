table of contents sales of multi purpose maintenance products in the americas segment increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this sales increase was driven by higher sales of wd multi purpose maintenance products in the us  which were up primarily due to new distribution within the mass retail channel  regained distribution within the home center channel and the impact of promotional activities for the wd multi use products during fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increased sales of wd products in the us were slightly offset by lower sales of these same products in latin america  which were down by primarily due to new trade restrictions and the unstable economic and political conditions  particularly in argentina and mexico  all of which continue to have a negative impact on our business development in those countries 
in addition  the overall sales increase of the multi purpose maintenance products in the americas segment was also attributable to the successful launch of the wd specialist product line which began shipping during fiscal year in the us and canada and realized positive sales results as compared to the initial forecasted sales for both regions

although sales of the homecare and cleaning products in the us  which is where the majority of such sales originate  decreased from period to period  sales of spot shot products increased in the us for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to new distribution and significant promotional display activities that were conducted during the current fiscal year  but not in the prior fiscal year 
this increase was more than offset by lower sales of carpet fresh and our automatic toilet bowl cleaners in the us due to lost distribution  competitive factors  and category declines

we experienced sales decreases throughout the europe direct markets for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  with percentage decreases in sales as follows the germanics sales region   italy   uk   iberia   and france  

table of contents the sales decline in the direct markets was primarily due to the adverse economic conditions  which have existed throughout europe since the beginning of our fiscal year and which worsened during the second half of the year  as well as the increased level of competition

sales in asia  which represented of the total sales in the asia pacific segment  increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the stable economic conditions which existed for much of the asia region during most of fiscal year the distributor markets in the asia region experienced a sales increase of million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the continued growth of the wd multi use products throughout the distributor markets  including those in indonesia  south korea and the philippines 
sales in china increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to the ongoing growth of our base business and the higher level of orders placed by our customers during promotional programs that were conducted in the first and third quarters of fiscal year in addition  sales in china were positively impacted by the timing of customer orders  specifically the higher level of such orders which were placed in advance of price increases that will become effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year foreign currency exchange rates also had a favorable impact on sales results in china from year to year 
on a constant currency basis  sales would have increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year

foreign currency exchange rates also had a favorable impact on sales results from year to year 
on a constant currency basis  sales would have increased million  or  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
gross profit gross profit increased to million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased to for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for the prior fiscal year due to a variety of items which negatively impacted gross margin  including costs associated with petroleum based materials and aerosol cans  the net additional costs incurred in support of changes that we are currently making to our north american supply chain infrastructure  other raw materials and manufacturing costs  sales mix changes and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these unfavorable items were partially offset by the positive impacts of sales price increases and lower manufacturing costs in our asia pacific segment from period to period 
gross margin was negatively impacted by percentage points due to the combined effects of changes in the costs of petroleum based materials and aerosol cans from period to period 
there is often a delay of one quarter or more before changes in raw material costs impact cost of products sold due to production and inventory life cycles 
the majority of this combined negative impact to gross margin from period to period was due to the increase in costs associated with petroleum based material 
we expect that petroleum based material costs will continue to be volatile and that volatility will impact our cost of products sold in future periods 
in addition  gross margin was negatively impacted by percentage points from period to period due to our north american supply chain restructure project 
as a result of this project  we incurred higher warehousing  handling fees and freight costs  which were all partially offset by lower manufacturing fees from our third party contract manufacturers  during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
a large portion of these additional costs resulted from us moving inventory between our various third party contract manufacturers and distribution centers in support of the redesign of our north american supply chain architecture 
the activities related to this redesign project started in the first quarter of fiscal year and include consolidation of our third party contract manufacturers and the restructuring of our distribution center network 
these changes  once completed  are expected to improve service delivery to our customers and to reduce overall costs associated with our north american supply chain network 
as we continue to transition to our new supply chain architecture  we may incur additional expenses in advance of the ultimate savings that we expect to gain once the implementation of this new architecture is complete 
we also incurred higher costs associated with raw materials related to our homecare and cleaning products  as well as increased manufacturing costs in our europe segment  which when combined negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points from period to period 
sales mix changes negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the higher sales mix in the distributor market in our europe segment year over year 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted gross margin by percentage points 
the aforementioned unfavorable impacts to gross margin were significantly offset by the sales price increases  which positively affected gross margin by percentage points for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
these sales price increases were implemented in certain locations and markets throughout most of fiscal year and in the second half of fiscal year lower manufacturing costs in our asia pacific segment also positively affected gross margin by percentage points from period to period 

table of contents note that our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to those of other consumer product companies  since some of these companies include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for shipment to our customers from our distribution centers and contract manufacturers and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively

as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses remained constant at for the fiscal years ended august  and the increase in sg a expenses was largely attributable to higher employee related costs  higher professional services costs and increased freight costs 
employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses  profit sharing  stock based compensation and other fringe benefits  increased million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to annual compensation increases and higher staffing levels in all segments 
this increase in compensation costs was partially offset by lower bonus and stock based compensation expenses from period to period 
although we started to experience some reduction in our freight costs in the third quarter of fiscal year as a result of our north american supply chain restructure  freight costs increased overall by million year over year primarily due to increased diesel costs and reduced truckload sizes as a result of smaller  more frequent orders being placed by our customers during the first half of the fiscal year professional services costs increased million due primarily to higher legal fees 
other miscellaneous expenses  which primarily include broker sales commissions  meeting expenses  office overhead expenses and software support expenses and fees  increased by million period over period 
the increases in sg a expenses described above were partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with new product exploration from period to period 
the decrease in new product exploration expenses within research and development of million was primarily due to the increased level of spending in this area during fiscal year related to the development of the wd specialist product line  which was launched in the first quarter of fiscal year changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased sg a expenses by million for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
we continued our research and development investment  the majority of which is associated with our multi purpose maintenance products  in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products

advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  increased million  or  to million from million for the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses remained constant at for the fiscal years ended august  and the increase in advertising and sales promotion expenses was due to a higher level of advertising and promotional activities period over period  primarily in our asia pacific segment 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on advertising and sales promotion expenses for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
investment in global advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year is expected to be in the range of to of net sales

amortization of definite lived intangible assets expense amortization of our definite lived intangible assets was million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization for the fiscal year ended august  was related to the additional amortization expense of flushes  spot shot and trade names starting march  as these intangible assets were changed to definite lived from indefinite lived intangible assets at february  the amortization for the fiscal year ended august  related only to the carpet fresh and x trade names and certain non contractual customer relationships from the acquisition of the line of products in fiscal year income from operations by segment the following table summarizes income from operations by segment in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  change from prior year dollars percent americas europe asia pacific income from operations for the americas segment includes corporate expenses  none of which are allocated to the other segments

the increases in sg a expenses described above were fully offset by lower employee related costs from period to period 
employee related costs  which include salaries  bonuses  profit sharing  stock based compensation and other fringe benefits  decreased million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to lower bonus expense 
in fiscal year  certain of our business segments did not achieve the sales and other profit performance metrics required to trigger payout of bonuses 
as a result  bonus expense and the related fringe benefit expense decreased million for fiscal year compared to fiscal year this decrease in bonus expense from period to period was slightly offset by a million increase in employee related costs as a result of increased staffing levels in fiscal year and the annual compensation increases  which were implemented in the first quarter of fiscal year and not in fiscal year we continued our research and development investment  the majority of which is associated with our multi purpose maintenance products  in support of our focus on innovation and renovation of our products 
research and development costs for the fiscal years ended august  and were million and million  respectively 
the level and types of expenses incurred within research and development can vary or offset each other from period to period depending upon the types of activities being performed by our product development team  team tomorrow 
advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in advertising and sales promotion expenses was due to a higher level of advertising and promotional activities period over period  primarily in our europe and asia pacific segments 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of million on advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year compared to fiscal year thus  on a constant currency basis  advertising and sales promotion expenses for fiscal year would have been million resulting in an increase in such expenses of million period over period 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities we employ and the period in which the costs are incurred 
total promotional costs recorded as a reduction to sales were million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
therefore  our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
amortization of definite lived intangible assets expense amortization of our definite lived intangible assets was million and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the increase in amortization for the fiscal year ended august  was related to the flushes  spot shot and trade names which were changed to definite lived intangible assets from indefinite lived intangible assets at february  the amortization for the fiscal year ended august  related only to the carpet fresh and x trade names and certain non contractual customer relationships from the acquisition of the line of products in fiscal year 
table of contents beginning march   the trade name is being amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life of twenty years  and the flushes and spot shot trade names are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of seventeen years 
the non contractual customer relationships intangible asset and the trade name are recorded and amortized in pounds sterling and are converted to us dollars for reporting purposes 
therefore  a portion of the fluctuation in amortization expense from period to period is the result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates

as a percentage of net sales  gross profit for the europe segment decreased to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year primarily due to the higher costs of petroleum based materials  sales mix changes and increased manufacturing costs in europe

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the decrease in the effective income tax rate from period to period was primarily due to the increase in the percentage benefit from the qualified domestic production deduction which increased from to of qualified production activities income from period to period 
the decrease was also attributable to the reinstatement of the research and experimentation credit during the fiscal year ended august  as well as the increasing proportion of the company s earnings which are foreign and are taxed at lower rates 
net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal year compared to million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis  for fiscal year changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year had a favorable impact of million on net income for fiscal year thus  on a constant currency basis  net income for fiscal year would have been million 
performance measures and non gaap reconciliations in managing our business operations and assessing our financial performance  we supplement the information provided by our financial statements with certain non gaap performance measures 
these performance measures are part of our rule  which includes gross margin  cost of doing business  and ebitda  the latter two of which are non gaap performance measures 
cost of doing business is defined as total operating expenses less amortization of definite lived intangible assets and depreciation in operating departments and 
table of contents ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we target our gross margin to be at or above of net sales  our cost of doing business to be at or below of net sales  and our ebitda to be at or above of net sales 
although our results for these performance measures may vary from period to period depending on various factors  including economic conditions and our level of investment in activities for the future  we continue to focus on and work towards achievement of our targets over the long term 
the following table summarizes the results of these performance measures fiscal year ended august  gross margin cost of doing business as a percentage of net sales ebitda as a percentage of net sales we use the performance measures above to establish financial goals and to gain an understanding of the comparative performance of the company from period to period 
we believe that these measures provide our shareholders with additional insights into the company s results of operations and how we run our business 
the non gaap financial measures are supplemental in nature and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net income  income from operations or other financial information prepared in accordance with gaap as indicators of the company s performance or operations 
reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to our financial statements as prepared in accordance with gaap are as follows cost of doing business in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  total operating expenses gaap amortization of definite lived intangible assets depreciation in operating departments cost of doing business net sales cost of doing business as a percentage of net sales ebitda in thousands  except percentages fiscal year ended august  net income gaap provision for income taxes interest income interest expense amortization of definite lived intangible assets depreciation ebitda net sales ebitda as a percentage of net sales liquidity and capital resources overview the company s financial condition and liquidity remain strong 
net cash provided by operations was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year we believe we continue to be well positioned to weather any uncertainty in the capital markets and global economy due to our strong balance sheet 
table of contents and efficient business model  along with our growing and diversified global revenues 
we continue to manage all aspects of our business including  but not limited to  monitoring the financial health of our customers  suppliers and other third party relationships  implementing gross margin enhancement strategies and developing new opportunities for growth 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and cash available from our revolving credit facility with bank of america  na bank of america 
to date  we have used the proceeds of the revolving credit facility for our stock repurchases and plan to continue using such proceeds for our general working capital needs and stock repurchases under any existing board approved share buy back plans 
during the fiscal year ended august   we borrowed million us dollars under the revolving credit facility and repaid million along with the associated interest of million with cash on hand 
in addition  we periodically have extended the maturity date of draws on the line of credit  however the balance on these draws has remained within a short term classification as a result of these extensions 
as of august   we had a million outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility agreement requires us to maintain minimum consolidated earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of million  measured on a trailing twelve month basis  at each reporting period 
at august   we were in compliance with all debt covenants as required by the revolving credit facility and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
we would need to have a significant decrease in sales and or a significant increase in expenses in order for us to not meet the debt covenants 
the million  fixed rate term loan  had a year term  which originated in october and was financed through prudential capital 
on october   we paid off the final balance due under this term loan of million and the associated interest of million with cash on hand 
at august   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents 
of this balance  million was held in europe  australia and china in foreign currencies 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings at these locations in order to ensure sufficient working capital  expand operations and fund foreign acquisitions in these locations 
we believe that our future cash from domestic operations together with our access to funds available under our unsecured revolving credit facility will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements  capital expenditures  share repurchases  dividend payments  acquisitions and new business development activities in the united states 
although we hold a significant amount of cash outside of the united states and the draws on the credit facility to date have been made by our entity in the united states  we do not foresee any issues with repaying or refinancing these loans with domestically generated funds since we closely monitor the use of this credit facility 
in the event that management elects for any reason in the future to repatriate some or all of the foreign earnings that were previously deemed to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states  we would incur additional tax expense upon such repatriation 
we believe that our existing consolidated cash and cash equivalents at august   the liquidity provided by our million revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our projected consolidated operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including future debt  principal and interest payments  future capital expenditure requirements  future share repurchases  future dividend payments which are determined on a quarterly basis by the company s board of directors  alternative investment opportunities  debt covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business

the increase in inventories from period to period was primarily attributable to increased purchases of product that we chose to make from our third party contract manufacturers in support of the redesign of our north american supply chain architecture 
not only do we expect that this new supply chain structure will result in higher levels of inventory than we have held in prior periods since we are moving product more quickly into our third party distribution centers which is company owned inventory  but we also expect that our inventory levels will fluctuate from period to period as we complete the transition phases of this redesign project 
in addition  inventories increased due to million of product including raw materials  components and finished products that we are obligated to purchase from one of our third party contract manufacturers  iq products company  in conjunction with the unanticipated termination of our business relationship with them which is the subject of pending litigation 
trade accounts receivable balances decreased for fiscal year whereas the balances increased for fiscal year primarily due to higher sales volumes in the final months of fiscal year compared to fiscal year and the timing of payments received from customers from period to period 
accrued payroll and related expenses decreased from period to period primarily due to the payment of fiscal year bonuses during the first quarter of fiscal year which were significantly lower than those paid in the prior year for fiscal year bonuses and lower bonus accruals in fiscal year accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from period to period primarily due to the increased inventory purchases related to the new supply chain architecture  the termination of the business relationship with iq products company and the timing of payments to suppliers 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year cash provided by operating activities decreased for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year due to changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily changes in trade accounts receivable  accrued payroll and related expenses  inventories  accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
trade accounts receivable increased primarily due to higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year accrued payroll and related expenses decreased from year to year primarily due to the payment of fiscal year bonuses during the first quarter of fiscal year which were significantly higher than those paid in the prior fiscal year and lower bonus accruals for fiscal year inventories increased due to additional purchases in support of the wd specialist line  which was launched in september  and promotions in the future quarters 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased from year to year due primarily to the increase in accounts payable balances resulting from increased business activities and the timing of payments 
also contributing to the overall change in cash provided by operating activities for both fiscal year compared to fiscal and fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the impact of changes in various 
table of contents account balances related to income taxes from period to period as a result of the year end provision for income taxes 
these entries resulted in changes to account balances for other assets  deferred tax assets and liabilities  income taxes payable and deferred and other long term liabilities 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to higher purchases of property and equipment of million  which were more than offset by higher proceeds from the sales of property and equipment of million  the majority of which came from the sale of our warehouse facility located in memphis  tennessee during the first quarter of fiscal year net cash used for investing activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to higher purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment during fiscal year were primarily for machinery and equipment  computer equipment and software 
also contributing to the increase in net cash used for investing activities was the purchase of million in short term investments during fiscal year financing activities net cash used in financing activities decreased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year driven in part by the million in draws that we executed against our revolving credit facility with bank of america during fiscal year this increase in cash was significantly offset by million in repayments made on this revolving credit facility and a million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options from year to year 
in addition  there was a million decrease in treasury stock purchases during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
net cash used for financing activities increased million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due primarily to million of treasury stock purchases which were transacted during the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal year the treasury stock purchases were partially offset by an increase of million from period to period in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
effect of exchange rate changes all of our foreign subsidiaries currently operate in currencies other than the us dollar and a significant portion of our consolidated cash balance is denominated in these foreign currencies  particularly at our uk subsidiary which operates in pound sterling 
as a result  our cash and cash equivalents balances are subject to the effects of the fluctuations in these currencies against the us dollars at the end of each reporting period 
the net effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  when expressed in us dollar terms  was a decrease in cash of million for fiscal year  an increase in cash of million for fiscal year and a decrease in cash of million for fiscal year these changes from period to period are primarily due to the significant fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates for the pound sterling against the us dollar 
the pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate decreased from to during fiscal year  increased from to during fiscal year and decreased from to during fiscal year share repurchase plans on december   the company s board of directors approved a share buy back plan  which was in effect through december   and authorized the company to acquire up to million of its outstanding shares

contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of minimum contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations and commitments as of august  for the next five years and thereafter in thousands 
future events could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
total year years years thereafter operating leases the following summarizes other commitments which are excluded from the contractual obligations table above as of august  we have ongoing relationships with various suppliers contract manufacturers who manufacture our products 
the contract manufacturers maintain title and control of certain raw materials and components  materials utilized in finished products  and of the finished products themselves until shipment to our customers or third party distribution centers in accordance with agreed upon shipment terms 
although we typically do not have definitive minimum purchase obligations included in the contract terms with our contract manufacturers  when such obligations have been included  they have been immaterial 
in the ordinary course of business  supply needs are communicated by us to our contract manufacturers based on orders and short term projections  ranging from two to five months 
we are committed to purchase the products produced by the contract manufacturers based on the 
table of contents projections provided 
this obligation includes purchasing obsolete or slow moving inventory from our contract manufacturers which we have done so in the past under these commitments  the amounts of which have been immaterial 
upon the termination of contracts with contract manufacturers  we obtain certain inventory control rights and are obligated to work with the contract manufacturer to sell through all product held by or manufactured by the contract manufacturer on our behalf during the termination notification period 
if any inventory remains at the contract manufacturer at the termination date  we are obligated to purchase such inventory which may include raw materials  components and finished goods 
prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  amounts for inventory purchased under termination commitments have been immaterial 
as a result of the unanticipated termination of the iq products company contract manufacturing agreement in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we are obligated to purchase million of inventory which is included in inventories in the company s consolidated balance sheet as of august  under the terms of the credit facility agreement with bank of america  we may borrow funds in us dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the three year period commencing june  through june  as of august   we had million outstanding on this credit facility 
based on our most recent cash projection  we expect to borrow additional amounts against this credit facility ranging from million to million in fiscal year we estimate that the interest associated with these borrowings will be approximately million for fiscal year based on the applicable interest rates and the expected payment dates of such borrowings 
at august   the liability recorded for uncertain tax positions  excluding associated interest and penalties  was approximately million 
we have estimated that up to million of unrecognized tax benefits related to income tax positions may be affected by the resolution of tax examinations or expiring statutes of limitation within the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions and these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
our financial results may have varied from those reported had different assumptions been used or other conditions prevailed 
our critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition and sales incentives sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to our customer when risks of loss and title have passed 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns  sales incentives  trade promotions and cash discounts 
we must make judgments and certain assumptions in order to determine when delivery has occurred 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  we determine an average time of transit of product to our customers  and this is used to estimate the time of delivery and whether revenue should be recognized during the current reporting period for such shipments 
differences in judgments or estimates related to the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition 
sales incentives are also recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
sales incentives include on going trade promotion programs with customers and consumer coupon programs that require us to estimate and accrue for the expected costs of such programs 
these programs include cooperative 
table of contents marketing programs  shelf price reductions  coupons  rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for shelf space and or favorable display positions in their stores and other promotional activities 
costs related to these sales incentive programs  with the exception of coupon costs  are recorded as a reduction to sales upon delivery of products to customers 
coupon costs are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as a reduction to sales as incurred  which is when the coupons are circulated 
sales incentives are calculated based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
the determination of sales incentive costs and the related liabilities require us to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns  status of trade promotion activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves accordingly on a quarterly basis 
our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates are different from the estimated rates 
if our accrual estimates for sales incentives at august  were to differ by  the impact on net sales would be approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions related to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances 
we specifically analyze historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and conditions and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we review our accounts receivable balances and our assumptions used to determine their collectability on a periodic basis and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts accordingly on a quarterly basis 
accounting for income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax liability or asset is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from the differences in financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in addition to valuation allowances  we provide for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet the recognition thresholds or measurement standards prescribed by the authoritative guidance on income taxes 
amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in periods when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
us federal income tax expense is provided on remittances of foreign earnings and on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested 
us federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
we determine whether our foreign subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely based on the capital needs of the foreign subsidiaries 
we reassess this determination each reporting period 
changes to this determination may be warranted based on our experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected remittances 
valuation of goodwill the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with the authoritative guidance on goodwill  intangibles and other 
we assess for possible impairments to goodwill at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
under updated authoritative guidance which was issued by the fasb in september  we are permitted to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test and then  if needed  the 
table of contents second step  to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
however  if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is more than its carrying amount  we do not need to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values  including goodwill 
we determine the fair values of our reporting units using the income valuation approach or other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
any impairment losses are recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
we elected to early adopt the provisions of this new guidance on goodwill in conjunction with our second quarter of fiscal year annual goodwill impairment test and we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount 
in performing this qualitative assessment  we assessed relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of each of our reporting units 
factors that were considered included  but were not limited to  the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market conditions  overall financial performance and expected financial performance  other entity specific events  such as changes in management or key personnel  and events affecting our reporting units  such as a change in the composition of net assets or any expected dispositions 
based on the results of this qualitative assessment  we determined that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of each of our reporting units is less than its fair value and  thus  the two step quantitative analysis was not required 
as a result  we concluded that no impairment of our goodwill existed as of february  in addition  there were no indicators of impairment identified as a result of our review of events and circumstances related to our goodwill or definite lived intangible assets subsequent to february  during our impairment tests performed in fiscal years and  we also did not identify or record any impairment losses related to our goodwill 
recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued updated authoritative guidance related to new disclosure requirements on offsetting financial assets and liabilities 
the new rules require companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position  as well as instruments and transactions subject to a netting arrangement 
the updated authoritative guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this updated authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial statement disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued updated authoritative guidance to amend the presentation of comprehensive income 
under these new presentation rules  companies will have the option to present other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under both alternatives  companies will be required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
in the single continuous statement approach  the guidance requires the entity to present the components of net income and total net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for other comprehensive income  along with the total of comprehensive income in that statement 
in the two statement approach  the income statement will be followed immediately by the statement of other comprehensive income  which will include the amount for total comprehensive income 
the amendments in this guidance also require that reclassifications from other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements  but this portion of the 
table of contents guidance was indefinitely deferred in accordance with the accounting standards update no 
which was issued by the fasb in december the updated authoritative guidance on comprehensive income is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company has evaluated this updated authoritative guidance  and expects to include this information as a continuous statement or a separate statement starting in fiscal year related parties on october   the company s board of directors elected mr

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  the company employs established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
all of the company s international subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company is exposed to foreign currency related risk when the financial statements of its international subsidiaries are translated for consolidation purposes from functional currencies to us dollars 
this foreign currency risk can affect sales  expenses and profits as well as assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company does not enter into any hedging activities to mitigate this foreign currency translation risk 
the company s uk subsidiary  whose functional currency is pound sterling  utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to limit its exposure in converting cash and intercompany accounts receivable balances denominated in non functional currencies 
the principal currency affected is the euro 
the company regularly monitors its foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions 
while the company engages in foreign currency hedging activity to reduce its risk  for accounting purposes  none of its foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
the company has performed a sensitivity analysis related to its foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at august  if the foreign currency exchange rates relevant to those contracts were to change unfavorably by  the company would incur a loss of approximately million 
interest rate risk as of august   the company had a million outstanding balance on its million three year revolving credit facility agreement with bank of america  na bank of america 
this million revolving credit facility is subject to interest rate fluctuations 
under the terms of the credit facility agreement  the company may borrow loans in us dollars or in foreign currencies from time to time during the three year period  which expires on june  all loans denominated in us dollars will accrue interest at the bank s prime rate or at libor plus a margin of percent together with any applicable mandatory liquid asset costs imposed by non us banking regulatory authorities 
all loans denominated in foreign currencies will accrue interest at libor plus percent 
any significant increase in the bank s prime rate and or libor rate could have a material effect on interest expense incurred on any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility
