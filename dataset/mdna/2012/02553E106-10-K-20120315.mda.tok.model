com  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  the possibility of engaging in future franchise agreements  growth through acquisitions  and or internally developing additional new brands  the possibility that our credit facilities may not be available for future borrowings  the possibility that rising prices of raw materials  labor  energy and other inputs to our manufacturing process  if unmitigated  will continue to have a significant impact to our profitability  and 
table of contents the possibility that we may be required to take additional store impairment charges related to underperforming stores 
we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we estimate gift card breakage and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net sales 
we determine an estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed 
we recognize royalty revenue generated from our franchise agreements based upon a percentage of merchandise sales by the franchisee 
this revenue is recorded as a component of net sales when earned 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company records merchandise receipts at the time merchandise is delivered to the foreign shipping port by the manufacturer fob port 
this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to us 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical 
table of contents percentages and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
asset impairment 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc  property  plant  and equipment  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment at the individual store level  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
impairment losses are recorded on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets 
when events such as these occur  the impaired assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded separately as a component of operating income under loss on impairment of assets 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
investment securities 
in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  we measure our investment securities using level  level and level inputs 
level and level inputs are valued using quoted market prices while we use a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the fair value of our level investments 
the assumptions in our dcf model include different recovery periods depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield and illiquidity 
these assumptions are subjective and they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation and related charge 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional net impairment loss recognized in earnings in the future 
we evaluate our investments for impairment in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities asc 
asc provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
additionally  asc requires additional disclosures relating to debt and equity securities both in the interim and annual periods as well as requires us to present total other than temporary impairment otti with an offsetting reduction for any non credit loss impairment amount recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term and the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term 
we calculate a weighted average expected term based on historical experience 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose 
table of contents to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as computed pursuant to asc deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits  may materially impact the effective income tax rate 
we evaluate our income tax positions in accordance with asc which prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under asc  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances or net income 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal years following those with weeks  including fiscal  the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
sales from american eagle  aerie and kids stores are included in comparable store sales 
sales from aeo direct and franchise stores are not included in comparable store sales 
our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise and achieving an optimal level of sales 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising executives  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our 
table of contents distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
merchandise profit is the difference between net sales and merchandise costs 
the inability to obtain acceptable levels of sales  initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 
operating income our management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses and our level of capital expenditures 
store productivity store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price aur  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover our management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity our management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
our management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
results of operations overview we delivered positive top line sales performance as a result of investments in key categories and a revenue driving promotional strategy in the fourth quarter 
total comparable stores sales for the year increased  in contrast to the decrease recorded in the first half of the year  driven by the comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter 
for the year  ae comparable store sales increased  aerie comparable store sales increased and sales for aeo direct increased 
the increased sales levels partially offset higher product costs 
increased product costs and our second half promotional activity resulted in pressure on merchandise margin for the year  which declined basis points as a rate to sales 
operating expenses were well controlled leading to basis points of improvement in selling  general and administrative expense as a rate to sales 
sg a dollars increased due to variable expense related to the sales increase and planned investments in advertising 
operating income for the year was million  which includes million in store impairment charges and million of executive transition costs 
income from continuing operations was per diluted share  and includes a per diluted share impact from the store impairment and a per diluted share impact from executive transition costs 
this compares to income from continuing operations of per diluted share last year  which includes a realized loss from the sale of investment securities of per diluted share 
we ended fiscal with million in cash  short term and long term investments  an increase of million from last year 
during the year  we generated million of cash from operations 
the cash from operations was offset by million of capital expenditures  a million purchase of intangible assets  and value returned to shareholders through share repurchases of million and dividend payments of million 
merchandise inventory at the end of fiscal was million  an increase of on a cost per square foot basis 
the increase reflects a high single digit increase in the ending average cost per unit driven by increased cotton costs

gross profit gross profit decreased to billion from billion in fiscal gross profit as a percent to net sales decreased by basis points to from last year 
the percentage decrease was attributed to a basis point decrease in merchandise margin and a basis point increase in buying  occupancy and warehousing costs  as a percent to net sales 
the decrease in merchandise margin was primarily the result of average unit cost increases  driven by higher product costs  and increased markdowns from our promotional activity 
buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased as a rate to sales as a result of the impact of increased rent  partially offset by the increase in comparable store sales for the year 
there was million of share based payment expense  consisting of time based awards  included in gross profit this year compared to million last year

there was million of share based payment expense  consisting of time based awards  included in selling  general and administrative expenses this year compared to million last year 
loss on impairment of assets the loss on impairment of assets of million resulted from our evaluation of under performing stores which exhibited an unanticipated increase in negative cash flow trends driven by fourth quarter results 
this impairment consisted of retail stores  largely related to the aerie brand 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to million from million last year 
this increase is primarily due to a greater property and equipment base driven by our level of capital expenditures  partially offset by disposals related to store closures during the year 
as a percent to net sales  depreciation and amortization expense decreased to from as a result of higher comparable store sales for the period 
realized loss on sale of investment securities there was no realized loss on sale of investment securities this year  compared to million  or per diluted share  last year 
the loss in fiscal was primarily due to the liquidation of of our auction rate security investment portfolio 
other income  net other income  net increased to million from million last year 
the change is primarily due to additional proceeds received from the ars call option this year 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate from continuing operations decreased to approximately in fiscal from in fiscal the higher effective income tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to losses on the sale of certain ars investments for which no income tax benefit was recognized

realized loss on sale of investment securities the realized loss on sale of investment securities was million  or approximately per diluted share  for fiscal this compares to a loss of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the loss in fiscal was primarily due to the liquidation of of our ars investment portfolio 
our ars investment portfolio was originally purchased as highly liquid short term instruments 
due to the deterioration of the ars market and ars investments experiencing failed auctions or long term auction resets  our ars investment portfolio was subsequently classified as long term  with a weighted average contractual maturity of approximately years 
this liquidation allowed us to convert substantially our entire ars investment portfolio to short term liquid assets  with total cash proceeds of million plus accrued interest and a net realized loss of million for the liquidation 
additionally  in the first half of fiscal  we liquidated million of ars investments for proceeds of million and a total realized loss of million

fair value measurements asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exit price associated with the sale of an asset or transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
financial instruments valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  asc establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
the tiers include level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs ie  projections  estimates  interpretations  etc 
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of january   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these include cash equivalents and short and long term investments  including ars 

table of contents in accordance with asc  the following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets cash equivalents and investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of january  fair value measurements at january  carrying amount quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets level significant other observable inputs level significant unobservable inputs level in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash money market commercial paper treasury bills total cash and cash equivalents short term investments treasury bills state and local government ars total short term investments long term investments ars call option total long term investments total percent to total we used a discounted cash flow dcf model to value our level investments 
for fiscal  the assumptions in our model for level investments  excluding the ars call option  included a recovery period of five months  a discount factor for yield of and illiquidity of 
these assumptions are subjective 
they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions ie  an increase in the recovery period by one year or an increase to the discount rate and illiquidity premium of basis points would not result in a material change to the valuation 
the fair value of the ars call option described in note to the consolidated financial statements was also estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
the model considered potential changes in yields for securities with similar characteristics to the underlying ars and evaluated possible future refinancing opportunities of the issuers of the ars 
the analysis then assessed the likelihood that the options would be exercisable as a result of the underlying ars being redeemed or traded in a secondary market at an amount greater than the exercise price prior to the end of the option term 
future changes in the fair values of the ars call option will be recorded within the consolidated statements of operations 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment securities  including a description of the securities and a discussion of the uncertainties relating to their liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources our uses of cash are generally for working capital  the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores  information technology upgrades  distribution center improvements and expansion  the purchase of both short and long term investments  the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends 
historically  
table of contents these uses of cash have been funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash on hand 
additionally  our uses of cash include the development of the aerie and kids brands 
we expect to be able to fund our future cash requirements in the us and canada through current cash holdings as well as cash generated from operations 
in the future  we expect that our uses of cash will also include further development of the aerie and kids brands 
our growth strategy includes internally developing new brands and the possibility of further international expansion or acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate these options to support future growth 
in the event we do pursue such options  we could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction  or that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability 
the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity january  january  working capital in s current ratio the million increase in our working capital and corresponding increase in the current ratio as of january  compared to january   resulted primarily from net income  net of non cash adjustments  offset by the use of cash for investing and financing activities

during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the payment of dividends and the partial repayment of million in borrowings against our demand line of credit 

table of contents asc requires that cash flows resulting from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost for share based payments be classified as financing cash flows 
accordingly  for fiscal  for fiscal and fiscal  the excess tax benefits from share based payments of million  million and million  respectively  are classified as financing cash flows
