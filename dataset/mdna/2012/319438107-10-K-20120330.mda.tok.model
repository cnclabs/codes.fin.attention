item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview the company is a bank holding company which owns of the stock of first capital bank the bank 
we are headquartered in glen allen  virginia and conduct our primary operations through our wholly owned subsidiary 
through its seven full service branch offices and courier service  the bank serves the greater richmond metropolitan area which includes the counties of henrico  chesterfield and hanover  the town of ashland and the city of richmond  virginia 
we target small to medium sized businesses and consumers in our market area and emerging suburbs outside of the greater richmond metropolitan area 
in addition  we strive to develop personal  knowledgeable relationships with our customers  while at the same time offering products comparable to statewide regional banks located in its market area 
we believe that the marketing of customized banking services has enabled it to establish a niche in the financial services marketplace in the richmond metropolitan area 
the continuing difficult economic environment during and resulted in continuing elevated loan loss provisions  which negatively impacted our financial performance as we realized a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a million loss for the year ended december  net loss allocable to common shareholders  which adds to the net loss the dividends and discount accretion on preferred stock  was a loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of million for the key factor affecting the results was a million provision for loans losses due to an unstable economic environment which resulted in a significant increase in the level of our charge offs 
return on average equity for the year ended december  was  while return on average assets was  compared to and  respectively  for for the year ended december   assets increased million to million or from million at december  total net loans at december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the december  amount of million 
deposits increased million to million  or from the december  amount of million 
the company remains well capitalized with capital ratios above the regulatory minimums 
the company has been keenly focused on five primary objectives for the last three years 
in order of importance  those areas are asset quality  capital preservation  liquidity  reducing exposure to real estate acquisition and development loans and improving core earnings 
each of these objectives will be discussed elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and this section are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and applications of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 

table of contents first capital bank s critical accounting policies relate to the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses and establishment of fair value of financial instruments 
the evaluation of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the bank s existing portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i asc contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when occurrence is probable and can be reasonably estimated  and ii asc receivables  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
the company s allowance for loan losses is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based on independent methodologies 
all components of the allowance represent an estimation performed pursuant to applicable gaap 
management s estimate of each homogenous pool component is based on certain observable data that management believes are most reflective of the underlying credit losses being estimated 
this evaluation includes credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes  geographic  borrower and industry concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  the findings of internal credit quality assessments and results from external bank regulatory examinations 
these factors  as well as historical losses and current economic and business conditions  are used in developing estimated loss factors used in the calculations 
applicable gaap requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the net realizable value of the collateral 
this statement also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on impaired loans 
reserves for commercial loans are determined by applying estimated loss factors to the portfolio based on historical loss experience and management s evaluation and risk grading of the commercial loan portfolio 
reserves are provided for noncommercial loan categories using historical loss factors applied to the total outstanding loan balance of each loan category 
additionally  environmental factors based on national and local economic conditions  as well as portfolio specific attributes  are considered in estimating the allowance for loan losses 
while management uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if future economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the valuations or  if required by regulators  based upon information available to them at the time of their examinations 
such adjustments to original estimates  as necessary  are made in the period in which these factors and other relevant considerations indicate that loss levels may vary from previous estimates 
securities available for sale and certain mortgage loans held for sale  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
from time to time  certain assets  consisting primarily of other real estate owned and impaired loans  may be recorded at fair value on a non recurring basis 
these non recurring fair value adjustments typically are a result of the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or a write down occurring during the period 
for example  if the fair value of an asset in these categories falls below its cost basis  it is considered to be at fair value at the end of the period of the adjustment 
in periods where there is no adjustment  the asset is generally not considered to be at fair value 
management 
table of contents believes this is a critical accounting policy because the estimation of fair value involves a high degree of complexity and requires us to make subjective judgments that often require assumptions or estimates about various matters 
results of operations net interest income we generate a significant amount of our income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
interest expense is a function of the average amount of deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
net interest income represents our principal source of earnings 
net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income 
the following table reflects an analysis of our net interest income using the daily average balance of our assets and liabilities as of the periods indicated

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  the low interest rates during the last year has placed downward pressure on the company s yield on earning assets and related interest income 
the decline in earning asset yields  however  has been offset principally by repricing of money market accounts and certificates of deposit to lower yields 
the company also expects net interest margin to be negatively impacted by continued low rates over the next several quarters 
net interest income for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  net interest income increased due to a basis point increase in the net interest margin from for the year ended december  to for the comparable period of average earning assets decreased million  or  to million for from million for average loans  net of unearned income decreased million for to million

the decline in earning asset yields  however  has been offset principally by repricing of money market accounts and certificates of deposit 
the company also expects net interest margin to be relatively stable over the next several quarters

this commitment is more fully discussed in the asset quality section below 
non interest income year ended december  compared to year ended december  non interest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for increasing profitability 
management continues to consider areas where non interest income can be increased 
non interest income increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in

total noninterest expense increased or thousand to million for as compared to million for the year noninterest expense was of average assets for the year ended december  salaries and employee benefits increased to million for the year as compared to million for salaries and benefits increased primarily due to adding a compliance officer  an additional lending officer and a controller during in addition  a mortgage operation was started during the third quarter in which individuals were employed for that function 
occupancy costs increased thousand as the result of increases in real estate taxes  utilities  and maintenance costs related to the purchase of the corporate headquarters in in addition  the company rented facilities for the mortgage operation starting in july depreciation expense increased thousand due to depreciation on the renovation of the corporate headquarters and depreciation for a full year on the purchase of the building

at december   we had no concentration of loans in any one industry exceeding 

table of contents asset quality the company continued to experience deterioration in asset quality during  principally within the builder residential real estate portfolio and the land development portfolio  as the housing market remained soft 
while economic indicators suggest the recession has technically ended and there are some signs of increased economic activity  the signals are somewhat mixed and there could be additional deterioration in asset quality in the near term 
the magnitude of any such softening is largely dependent upon any lagging impact on commercial real estate  the recovery of residential housing  and the pace at which the economies in the markets we serve recover 
the company does not originate or purchase loans from foreign entities or loans classified by regulators as highly leveraged transactions 
the company s loan portfolio does not include exposure to option adjustable rate mortgage products  high loan to value ratio mortgages  interest only mortgage loans  subprime mortgage loans or mortgage loans with initial teaser rates 
the company does have junior lien mortgages second mortgages  primarily home equity loans 
the company s second mortgage portfolio is originated within the company s footprint and represented approximately of the total loan portfolio at december   down from at december  the company has low loss experience within this portfolio and is prompted to perform updated valuations upon identification of a borrower weakness 
the sources of valuations are appraisals  broker price opinions  and automated valuation models 
resources continue to be devoted specifically to the ongoing review of the loan portfolio and the workouts of problem assets to minimize any losses to the company 
the company has in place a special assets loan committee  which includes the company s chief lending officer  chief credit officer  and other senior lenders and credit officers 
this committee formulates strategies  develops action plans  and approves all credit actions taken on significant problem loans 
management continues to monitor delinquencies  risk rating changes  charge offs  market trends and other indicators of risk in the company s portfolio  particularly those tied to residential and commercial real estate  and adjusts the allowance for loan losses accordingly 
historically  and particularly in the current economic environment  the company seeks to work with its customers on loan collection matters while taking appropriate actions to improve the company s position and minimize any losses 
these loans are closely managed and evaluated for collection with appropriate loss reserves established whenever necessary

we place loans on a non accrual when the collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when we place a loan on non accrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on non accrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals on interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses to be charged against earnings

these lines of credit  which bear interest at prevailing market rates  permit us to borrow funds in the overnight market  and are renewable annually 
interest rate sensitivity the most important element of asset liability management is the monitoring of the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements 
the income stream of the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent there is a difference between the amount of the company s interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid  mature or repriced in specific periods 
our goal is to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk to changes 
table of contents in interest rates 
we seek to meet this goal by influencing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of the various lending and deposit taking lines of business and by managing discretionary balance sheet asset and liability portfolios 
we monitor interest rate levels on a daily basis at meetings of the asset liability sub committee 
the following reports and or tools are used to assess the current interest rate environment and its impact on our earnings and liquidity monthly and year to date net interest margin and spread calculations  monthly and year to date balance sheet and income statements versus budget  quarterly net portfolio value analysis  a weekly survey of rates offered by other local competitive institutions and gap analysis matching maturities or repricing dates of interest sensitive assets to those of interest sensitive liabilities by periods and a risk manager model used to measure earnings at risk and economic value of equity at risk 
the data in the following table reflects repricing or expected maturities of various assets and liabilities 
the gap analysis represents the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in a specific time interval 
interest sensitivity gap analysis presents a position that existed at one particular point in time  and assumes that assets and liabilities with similar repricing characteristics will reprice at the same time and to the same degree

the federal reserve board has established minimum regulatory capital standards for bank holding companies and state member banks 
the regulatory capital standards categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four categories that weight balance sheet assets according to risk  requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets

one of our primary goals for was capital preservation

liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits with banks  federal funds sold  short term investments  securities classified as available for sale as well as loans and securities maturing within one year 
as a result of our management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding  management believes we maintain overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy our depositors requirements and meet our clients credit needs 
we also maintain additional sources of liquidity through a variety of borrowing arrangements 
the bank maintains federal funds lines with a large regional money center banking institution and a local community bankers bank 
these available lines currently total approximately million  of which there were no outstanding draws at december  
table of contents we have a credit line at the federal home loan bank of atlanta in the amount of approximately million which may be utilized for short and or long term borrowing 
advances from the federal home loan bank totaled million at december  at december   cash  federal funds sold  short term investments  securities available for pledge or sale and available lines were of total deposits up from at december  maintaining liquidity at levels to cover any eventuality was a primary goal of and we feel that the levels maintained during and accomplish that goal
