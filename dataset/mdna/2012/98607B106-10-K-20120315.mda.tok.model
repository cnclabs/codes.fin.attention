overview we are a leading crop nutrient company in china in term of total sales in we are primarily engaged in research  development  manufacturing and sales of fulvic acid based crop and animal nutrient products for the agriculture and stock farming industry 
we are headquartered in beijing with production facilities in hohhot  inner mongolia autonomous region of china inner mongolia 
our products are sold nationwide in provinces  autonomous regions and centrally administered municipalities across china 
currently  our principal product is liquid crop nutrient  from which we derived substantially all of our sales for the year ended december  we also produce powder animal nutrient product which is mainly used for dairy cows 
we market both products under the trade name shengmingsu in chinese which means life essential 
we produce our liquid crop nutrient product based on a patented formula utilizing fulvic acid as the primary compound base which is combined with various micro nutrients such as zinc and boron as well as macro nutrients like nitrogen  phosphorous and potassium npk that are essential for the health of crops 
our product s core fulvic acid compound improves crop yield by enhancing the absorption of fertilizers and micro nutrients 
in addition  the micro nutrients and npk included in our product formulation serves as a supplement during key growth stages of crops 
we believe that our product is particularly well suited for use in china  which generally has highly degraded farming soil as a result of over farming  decades of over use of chemical fertilizers and less advanced farming practices compared with more developed nations 
after water dilution  our liquid crop nutrient product is most commonly applied through directly spraying onto leaves of crops and typically used at certain critical growth stages of crops in addition to normal fertilizer application 
in  we sold approximately  tons of our liquid crop nutrient product  the revenue from which represented of our total revenue  and tons of our animal nutrient product  the revenue from which represented of our total revenue 
recent developments on may   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with mspea  an affiliate of morgan stanley  and full alliance  our largest shareholder  pursuant to which we sold to mspea  shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of us million 
on may  and june   we and three of our officers and directors were named in putative class action lawsuits filed in the us federal district court for the southern district of new york alleging  among other things  that we and such officers and directors issued false and misleading information to investors about our financial and business condition 
these securities class action complaints generally allege that yongye s business was not growing at the rate represented by the defendants and that yongye s financial results as reported to the securities and exchange commission were inconsistent with its production capabilities 
on december   the securities class actions were consolidated and a consolidated class action complaint was filed alleging we and our officers and directors issued false and misleading information to investors about our financial and business conditions 
on march   the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed this action with prejudice as to themselves as named plaintiffs 
on july  we and certain of our officers and directors were named in a derivative suit filed in the first judicial district court of the state of nevada and carson city alleging  among other things  that such directors and officers breached their fiduciary duties to us  misrepresented our earnings  wasted corporate assets and unjustly enriched themselves at the expense of us 
the derivative complaint also alleges that yongye  at the direction of or with the approval of its directors  failed to implement and adequate system of internal and financial controls 
this lawsuit is in its early stage 
we believe the claims contained in the lawsuit to be without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
factors affecting our operating results market potential for crop nutrient products in china the long term market growth of crop nutrient products in china is primarily driven by the need to improve crop yield to ensure sufficient food supply in view of limited and shrinking per capita arable land in china 
currently  with only approximately of the world s arable land  china needs to feed billion people  or approximately of the world s population 
according to the national population and family planning commission of china  china s population will reach billion by therefore  the country faces the challenge of producing additional food to feed the additional million people within the next years 
this puts great pressure on china s agricultural system to increase production output

over farming  decades of overuse of chemical fertilizers and less advanced farming practices have led to degraded soil quality in china 
although  according to fao  china leads the world in fertilizer consumption  applying more fertilizers than the world average on a per hectare basis  the crop yield lags behind most developed countries 
this creates a huge demand for crop nutrient products that can help improve fertilizer utilization and increase crop yield 
fulvic acid based crop nutrients are particularly well suited for the market  as it can allow crops to more effectively absorb fertilizers and minerals from the degraded soils

the market for our crop nutrient product is large and has attractive long term growth prospects 
china has billion mu each mu is equivalent to approximately square meters of arable land in total 
typically  each mu of arable land requires at least ml of our liquid crop nutrient product for one growing season 
for the year of  our crop nutrient product is estimated to have been used in only less than of the arable land in china  assuming there is one and half growing season per annum on average for all the arable land across china 
distribution network the agricultural goods market is very fragmented and spans over  villages in over  counties in over provincial regions in china 
as farmers in china tend to be less mobile  it is vital to distribute at the village level in order to address this market 
however  due to the scattered nature of china s villages  it is necessary to work through county level distributors in order to overcome barriers related to geography  local cultures and business networks 
to sell to farmers through village retail stores  crop nutrient manufacturers typically work with provincial level distributors to manage county level distributors or work directly with county level distributors 
in order to more rapidly achieve nationwide coverage  we have adopted a strategy to work with provincial level distributors which in turn sell our products to county level distributors  branded retailers and end customers 
we invest significantly in branding  training and technical support to motivate and maintain the long term loyalty of our distributors and branded retailers  which is critical to successfully selling product through a multi tier distribution network 
since we enter and expand into provincial regions at different times  our sales in different provincial markets vary due to different market penetration rates 
our end customers are comprised of large farms which purchase directly from distributors  and individual farmers who purchase through branded retailers or through promotional events held by local distributors 
our branded retailer network has been a key driver of our sales 
the number of branded retailers increased from  as of december  to  as of december  jiangsu  xinjiang  heilongjiang  henan  yunnan and hebei provinces accounted for the majority of newly recruited branded retailers 
seasonality our liquid crop nutrient product is most commonly applied by directly spraying onto leaves of crops in the second and third quarters  which corresponds to the growing seasons for most crops in most parts of china 
accordingly  the sales during the second and third quarters typically represent of our annual sales 
we typically accumulate higher volumes of finished goods during the non peak season in preparation for the subsequent peak sales seasons which will result in higher inventory turnover days during non peak seasons 
agriculture sector the agriculture industry in china enjoys favorable government policies 
in  there was rmb billion us billion budgeted government spending on agriculture  rural areas and farmers  higher than in according to the th five year national economic and social plan of china  the chinese government will continue to support the agriculture industry 
increasing the agriculture production capacity and developing high yield  high quality and high efficiency agriculture are the focus of the chinese government 
given our product s ability to improve fertilizer utilization  increase crop yield  improve product quality  and enhance crop s drought resistance  we expect that we will further benefit from the chinese government s agricultural policy 
in addition  agriculture continues to be a heavily invested sector in china 
brand name investors continue to invest into china s agriculture industry because they have confidence in china s long term outlook 
the market volume for agriculture products is large  both for domestic sales and export 
this is driven by the growing demand for higher quality food products domestically and international reliance on food products from china 
currently  china is the world s biggest grower and consumer of grains and yet must boost crop yields by at least a year to ensure the country has enough food to feed its billion people  according to the former minister of agriculture  sun zhengcai china economic net  july  
additional policy changes are expected to include protecting farmland and increasing rural incomes to retain farming interest 
the goal of government policies is to maintain self sufficiency in food production because no other country can feed the world s biggest population  according to sun 
our strategy must be based on stable farmland  and seeking ways to improve yields  sun said in a speech to local officials  outlining the government s near and long term agriculture policy and objectives 
china  which harvested more summer crops  aims also to boost grain and oilseed output this year  sun said 
to ensure next year s crops production  officials must stabilize area planted with winter wheat and use idle land in the off season to grow rapeseed  sun said 
new land reform policy farmland in china is owned by the local government  but given to local farmers for cultivation under year use contracts 
with the allure of higher incomes and better living conditions in the city  in some places  farmers have abandoned the land and no other farmers have stepped in to bring it back into production 
this has created a shortage of productive agricultural land 
the government has acknowledged this issue and recently enacted a new land use reform policy which liberalizes the exchange of land among the nation s farmers 
this creates a new model for china s million farmers with the idea being to create more stable farmland by shifting the country away from the single household farm plot model to the amalgamation of larger scale operations which should be more productive due to technology and economies of scale 
farmers will be able to transfer their land use rights to others through a new market system for rural land use rights 
chinese authorities commented that  without modernizing agriculture  china cannot modernize  without stability and prosperity in rural areas  china cannot have stability and prosperity 
these changes are enacted to ensure national food security and the supply of major agricultural products  and promote increases in agricultural production  farm incomes and rural prosperity 
china s ongoing agriculture modernization  usda  april 
drought many regions in china have experienced drought in the past several years and our company s growth to date was partly due to the anti natural disaster feature of its shengmingsu product 
we believe one important benefit of our shengmingsu branded crop nutrient product is to help crop counteract the effects of water deprivation 
crops sprayed with shengmingsu are able to better withstand the effects of drought and continue to flourish alongside withering crops which received only traditional fertilizer 
our crop nutrient product has been used in a number of drought affected areas to assist local farmers in combating the conditions

this significant increase in accounts receivable was attributable to i our substantial sales increase by us million from us million in to us million in which represents an increase of  ii in  we experienced significantly more sales in september  october and november than the corresponding months in amounting to us million  which have historically been non peak season months and which were to be collected in the first and second quarters of  and iii the significant increase of our accounts receivable turnover days from days in to days in the significant increase of our accounts receivable turnover days in was primarily due to the delayed payments by certain of our distributors which also conduct business in distribution of nitrogen  potash and phosphorus npk fertilizers  in addition to our nutrient products 
since the npk fertilizer suppliers typically have a substantially lower profit margin  the npk fertilizer suppliers normally require distributors to pay deposit upfront at year end to guarantee the normal supply in next year 
in  china tightened its monetary policy and it became very difficult to obtain financing from financial institutions 
thus our distributors were under greater liquidity pressure than before 
in order to respond to the cash flow shortage caused by the tightened financing  such distributors took full advantage of our six month credit term to pay deposit for npk fertilizer 
the delay in payments from the distributors was not due to excessive inventories held by such distributors  which could not be sold 
the shipments and sales of our products are based on the orders initiated by our distributors 
their orders are based on the demand of the end customers or county level distributors 
in addition  none of our distributors has any dispute on any outstanding account receivables

accounts receivable represents those receivables derived in the ordinary course of business 
accounts receivable is reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on estimates of market condition and distributors financial status  aging analyses of accounts receivable balances  historical experience and other factors surrounding the credit risk of specific distributors 
past due balances of accounts receivable are reviewed individually for collectability 
as of december   there were past due balances of accounts receivable due from certain distributors 
in addition  as of february   these distributors also had past due balances 
although we have the enforceable right for collection and intend to pursue collection  we believe that the collectability of these past due balances are doubtful  and we recorded an allowance for doubtful receivables in the amount us million as of december  after our wuchuan facility was put into operation  we have significantly increased production capacity 
in addition  we improved inventory management and reduced inventory turnover days to days for the year ended december  compared to days for the same period of the cash consideration for the resource project is rmb million or approximately us million  of which rmb million or approximately us million remains to be paid 
according to preliminary third party analysis  the mineral resource of the project we acquired is at surface level and the open pit mining method is recommended 
also  our wuchuan facility was built near the mineral resource project to minimize future shipping expense 
in december  yongye nongfeng obtained two short term bank loans of rmb  equivalent to us  and rmb  equivalent to us  each with a fixed annual interest rate of  from china citic bank 
these two short term bank loans are pledged by the inventory  land use right and buildings of yongye nongfeng 
these two short term loans are due on june  total equity increased by us million from us million as of december  to us million as of december  the increase in our total equity was mainly due to an increase in retained earnings of us million for the net income attributable to yongye international  inc during the year and an increase in common stock and additional paid in capital of us million  as a result of the  and  restricted shares granted to management and independent directors

of the us million increase of sales for the year ended december   us million  or  were derived from existing provincial markets  primarily due to higher penetration rate  more effective channel management and continued retail network development in provinces such as jiangsu  heilongjiang jilin liaoning  hebei  inner mongolia  henan and guangdong 
in jiangsu and hebei  our sales continued to grow as our distributors effectively executed our marketing programs 
in heilongjiang jilin liaoning and inner mongolia  demand from large farms increased significantly 
we also achieved significant growth in newly developed provincial markets including yunnan  jiangxi  sichuan  shaanxi and anhui 
for example  farmers in yunnan province increased usage of our liquid nutrient product for tobacco and flowers 
for the year ended december   the average selling price asp of our liquid crop nutrient product was us  per ton  as compared to us  per ton for the same period of the small increase in our asp is primarily the result of the effect of currency rate fluctuations 
these increases of our sales from the year of to were driven by higher demand for our liquid crop nutrient product throughout our market area  including our traditional markets with higher penetration of  and the new markets with significant growth 
the growth was mainly due to the great increase in the quantity of product sold while our prices remained relatively stable in most region market except hebei 
additionally  after the acquisition of hebei customer list  we are selling at a higher price directly to lower level distributors in hebei  which is yongye s largest regional market in china  representing approximately of sales in the following table set forth the sales breakdown by region for the year ended december   and vs vs sales by region us mm change in us vs change in change in us vs change in hebei beijing tianjin inner mongolia shandong guangdong hainan henan heilongjiang jilin liaoning xinjiang hubei hunan gansu qinhai jiangsu shanxi anhui x shaanxi x sichuan chongqin x jiangxi fujian x yunnan guizhou x zhejiang na guangxi na ningxia shanghai na others total less than us  our gross profit increased by us million from us million in to us million in  representing an increase of

the gross margin increase from to was mainly due to the benefits from economics of scale 
moreover  after the acquisition of hebei customer list in july  our increased margin for the sales made in hebei province also contributed to the increase of gross profit ratio

as a percentage of sales for the year ended december   selling expenses increased by to as compared to of sales in the year ended december   due to an increase of us million in advertising expenses mainly resulting from more promotional activities in  as we entered into more geographic markets and conducted several nation wide joint programs with china central television station cctv

the decrease in fair value during the year ended december  resulted in a gain of us  the decrease in fair value of the warrants was primarily due to the decrease in our stock price from us per share at january  to us at december  the change in fair value of the warrants for the year ended december  resulted in a loss of us  as compared with a loss of us  for the year ended december  corporate income taxes we did not carry on any business and did not maintain any branch office in the united states during the years ended december    and and do not intend to repatriate any earnings from the chinese operations

liquidity and capital resources our company has historically financed its operations and capital expenditures principally through issuance of common shares and bank loans 
as is customary in the industry  we provide credit terms to all of our distributors which typically exceed the terms that we receive from our suppliers 
currently  we provide credit terms of up to six months to distributors with well established trading records 
therefore  our liquidity needs have generally consisted of working capital necessary to finance receivables and raw material and finished goods inventory 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future cash needs for the coming growing season 
we may  however  require additional cash resources due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
therefore  there can be no assurance that such additional investment will be available to us  or if available  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us

the changes were primarily due to the increase of us million in working capital employed  which was primarily driven by higher accounts receivables  but was partially offset by utilization of deposits to raw material suppliers for the year ended december  as compared to when the deposits were made to the suppliers 
other factors include an increase of us million in earnings and a non cash expense of us million for management stock compensation 
for the year ended december   the change was mainly due to more efficient controls on working capital  effective collection on receivables  as well as the significant growth of sales compared with the same period of our accounts receivable increased by us million in as compared to  representing an increase of 
this significant increase in accounts receivable was attributable to i our substantial sales increase by us million from us million in to us million in which represents an increase of  ii in  we experienced significantly more sales in september  october and november than the corresponding months in amounting to us million  which were usually non peak season in the past and which were to be collected in the first and second quarter of  and iii the significant increase of our accounts receivable turnover days from days in to days in the significant increase of our accounts receivable turnover days in was primarily due to the delayed payments by certain of our distributors which also conduct business in distribution of nitrogen  potash and phosphorus npk fertilizers  in addition to our nutrient products

in december  we entered into two short term bank loan agreements with china citic bank for an aggregate loan amount of us million 
for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in  the changes were mainly due to that we received cash from our offerings in may and december amounting to us million  which was offset by expenses incurred in stock issuance costs of us million  as well as the repayment of loans and payables of us million during the year ended december  net current assets at december  increased by us million to us million from us million  or  over december  impact of inflation we are subject to commodity price risks arising from price fluctuations in the market prices of the raw materials 
we have generally been able to pass on cost increases through price adjustments 
however  the ability to pass on these increases depends on market conditions influenced by the overall economic conditions in china 
we manage our price risks through productivity improvements and cost containment measures 
we do not believe that inflation risk is material to our business or our financial position  results of operations or cash flows at this time

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the footnote to our company s financial statements summary of significant accounting policies describes the major accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the financial statements 
the following are considered to be the company s critical accounting policies accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recognized and carried at the original invoiced amount less an allowance for any uncollectible accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and review the composition of accounts receivable  analyze historical bad debts  customer concentration  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate if allowance for doubtful accounts is needed 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we primarily determine the allowance by analyzing specific customer accounts that have known or potential collection issues and applying an estimated loss rate on the customer accounts with consideration of the aging of the receivable balances  customer payment patterns during the year and subsequent to year end 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
in the event that we believe an account receivable will become uncollectible  we record additional provision to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting effect of this entry is a charge to income 
as of december   we recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts in the amount of us million 
if the financial condition of our distributors deteriorates in future  we would make further allowance for doubtful accounts  which could be significant 
furthermore  the financial condition deterioration of our distributors  in turn  directly affects our revenue recognition 
one of the criteria to recognize revenues is that the collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
as such  deteriorating payment ability of our distributors will result in revenue recognition of our product sales being delayed  generally until the receipt of cash 
inventory we value our finished goods inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes cost of direct labor and raw materials  as well as allocation of variable and fixed production overhead 
variable production overheads are allocated to each unit of production based on the actual use of the production facilities 
fixed production overheads are allocated to the cost of conversion based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we define normal production capacity as being a reasonable level of production volume supported by sufficient customer demand without any abnormal equipment downtime due to shortages of materials and labor  taking into consideration the loss of production capacity resulting from planned maintenances 
we would write down the cost of excessive inventory 
the factors considered in evaluating whether excessive inventory exists are our forecast of future demand  including existing customers order and forecasted orders  and the expiration date for the specific products 
inventory write downs are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
if our current assumptions about future production  inventory levels or demand were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs would be required  which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations

however  the cumulative amount of compensation cost recognized at any date equals at least the portion of the grant date value of such award that is vested at that date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk all of our net sales  and majority of costs and expenses are denominated in rmb 
although the conversion of the rmb is highly regulated in china  the value of the rmb against the value of the us dollar or any other currency nonetheless may fluctuate and be affected by  among other things  changes in china s political and economic conditions 
under current policy  the value of the rmb is permitted to fluctuate within a narrow band against a basket of certain foreign currencies 
china is currently under significant international pressures to liberalize this government currency policy  and if such liberalization were to occur  the value of the rmb could appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar 
because substantially all of our earnings and majority of our cash assets are denominated in rmb  other than certain cash deposits we keep in a bank in hong kong and us  appreciation or depreciation in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar would affect our financial results reported in us dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations 
fluctuations in the exchange rate will also affect the relative value of any dividend we issue in future that will be exchanged into us dollars and earnings from  and the value of  any us dollar denominated investments we make in the future 
very limited hedging transactions are available in china to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all 
in addition  our currency exchange losses may be magnified by prc exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert rmb into foreign currency 
interest rate risk we have not been  nor does it anticipate being  exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates 
our risk exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest income generated by cash deposited in interest bearing savings accounts 
we have not used  and do not expect to use in the future  any derivative financial instruments to hedge its interest risk exposure 
however  our future interest income may fall short of its expectation due to changes in interest rates in the market 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from its cash in bank and accounts receivable 
the credit risk on cash in bank and fixed deposits is limited because the counterparties are recognized financial institutions 
accounts receivable are subjected to credit evaluations 
an allowance would be made  if necessary  for estimated irrecoverable amounts by reference to past default experience  if any  and by reference to the current economic environment 
inflation inflationary factors  such as increases in the cost of our products and overhead costs  could impair our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales revenue if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs 
company s operations are substantially in foreign countries substantially all of our operations are conducted in china and are subject to various political  economic  and other risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting business in china 
among other risks  our company and our subsidiaries operations are subject to the risks of restrictions on transfer of funds  export duties  quotas  and embargoes  domestic and international customs and tariffs  changing taxation policies  foreign exchange restrictions  and political conditions and governmental regulations
