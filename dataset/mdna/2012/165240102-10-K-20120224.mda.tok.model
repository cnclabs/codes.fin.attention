item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the trust was organized as a self advised reit in the state of maryland in june  with a focus on investments in primarily upper upscale hotels in major business and convention markets and  on a selective basis  premium select service and extended stay hotels in urban settings or unique locations in the us we believe industry dynamics since our inception have created and will continue to create attractive opportunities to acquire high quality hotels  at prices below replacement costs  with attractive yields on investment and significant upside potential 
we completed our ipo in january and have since acquired or committed to acquire the following hotels hotel location rooms acquisition date hyatt regency boston boston  ma march  hilton checkers los angeles los angeles  ca june  courtyard anaheim at disneyland resort anaheim  ca july  boston marriott newton newton  ma july  le meridien san francisco san francisco  ca december  homewood suites seattle convention center seattle  wa may  w chicago city center chicago  il may  hotel indigo san diego gaslamp quarter san diego  ca june  courtyard washington capitol hill navy yard washington  dc june  hotel adagio san francisco  ca july  denver marriott city center denver  co october  holiday inn new york city midtown st street new york  ny december  hyatt place new york midtown south new york  ny under contract in mid  us lodging demand started to decline as a result of the economic recession which led industry revpar to decline for the year  as reported by smith travel research 
throughout  the decrease in lodging demand accelerated with revpar down for the year  the largest decline recorded by smith travel research since they began tracking the us lodging industry 
in  demand for rooms increased in almost all of the major markets as general economic indicators began to experience improvement 
with lodging demand increasing  pricing power began to return in major markets in the second half of revpar increased in as compared to  as reported by smith travel research 
in  we saw the progressive trends of improved fundamentals in the us lodging industry continue and strengthen with revpar increasing as compared to as a result of an increase in occupancy of percentage points and an increase in adr of 
our hotel portfolio saw an even greater increase in revpar than that of the industry as our hotels are located in major markets and primarily driven by the business transient customer  which are generally higher rated business 
given occupancy levels at our hotels had already stabilized to over  our hotels were able to continue reducing the amount of discounted business in order to take in higher rated business and increase adr 
increases in adr typically result in higher hotel profitability than increases in occupancy since variable hotel expenses generally do not increase correspondingly 
in addition  our hotels which benefit from group business also began to see group rates and booking pace improve meaningfully during the year 
we expect these positive operating trends to continue in and for several years to come as business and international travel look poised to remain strong  despite the slow overall economic growth  persistently high unemployment rates  and increased global volatility and risk related to the european debt crisis 
these trends will be further supported with supply of available rooms expected to rise at depressed levels over the next several years 
we remained active in growing our hotel portfolio and executing our acquisition strategy in  acquiring or committing to acquire eight high quality hotels with aggregate purchase prices of million  all located in central business districts of markets with high barriers to entry 
beginning in the third quarter and continuing through the date of this report  the hotel transaction market slowed as compared to the first half of as a consequence of increased global economic concerns and volatility  and its resulting impact on the equity capital markets 
we believe  with global economic concerns and volatility slowly dissipating and with debt maturities expected to increase in the second half of and likely motivating certain hotel 
table of contents owners to sell  hotel transaction activity will increase 
however  given our current leverage and our desire to avoid issuing new equity at our current trading price  we expect to pursue only the most compelling opportunities to make acquisitions in the near term 
we will continue to proactively asset manage our current hotel portfolio and invest in select return on investment projects to generate strong internal growth

as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our primary source of cash to meet operating requirements  including payment of dividends in accordance with the reit requirement of the us federal income tax laws  payment of interest on any borrowings and funding of any capital expenditures  will be from our hotels results of operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations 
we intend to incur indebtedness to supplement our investment capital and to maintain flexibility to respond to industry conditions and opportunities 
we are targeting an overall debt level not to exceed of the aggregate purchase prices of all of our portfolio hotels 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as new hotel acquisitions and scheduled debt maturities  through additional secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on  among other things  general market conditions for hotel companies and reits and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze alternate sources of capital in an effort to minimize our capital costs and maximize our financial flexibility 
in february  we filed a registration statement on form s with the sec  registering equity securities with a maximum aggregate offering price of up to million 
as of december   we had equity securities with a maximum aggregate offering price of million available to issue under this registration statement 
on october   we amended our credit agreement providing for a new three year secured revolving credit facility  maturing on october  the amended credit agreement increased the maximum amount we may borrow from million to million  and provides for the possibility of further future increases  up to a maximum of million  in accordance with the terms of the amended credit agreement 
subject to certain conditions  the revolving credit facility allows for a one year extension 
the interest rate for borrowings under the revolving credit facility was reduced to libor plus the spread over libor based on our consolidated leverage ratio as compared to libor plus  subject to a libor floor of under the previous facility 
the amount we can borrow under our revolving credit facility is based on the value of our hotels included in the borrowing base  as defined in the amended credit agreement 
as of february   the revolving credit facility was secured by seven hotels providing borrowing availability of million  of which we had million outstanding 
the amended credit agreement contains standard financial covenants  including certain leverage ratios  coverage ratios  and a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility and other long term debt 
on february   we declared a dividend in the amount of per share payable to common shareholders of record as of march  the dividend will be paid on april  we expect to continue declaring distributions to shareholders  as required to maintain our reit status  although no assurances can be made that we will continue to generate sufficient income to distribute similar aggregate amounts in the future 
the per share amounts of future distributions will depend on the number of our common and preferred shares outstanding from time to time and will be determined by our board of trustees following its periodic review of our financial performance and capital requirements  and the terms of our existing borrowing arrangements 
we currently have the room hyatt place new york midtown south  currently under development  under contract for a purchase price of million  plus customary pro rated amounts and closing costs 
we expect to fund the purchase price with available cash and by borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
we have already deposited million under the purchase and sale agreement  which is non refundable except in the event of a default under the purchase and sale agreement by the seller or expressly otherwise provided by the purchase and sale agreement 
in conjunction with signing the definitive agreement  we agreed to loan the seller million  the proceeds of which will be used toward completing construction of the hotel 
the loan bears interest at per annum and is secured by a second mortgage lien on the hotel 
the loan matures at the earlier of the closing on the hotel acquisition or december   but may be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the loan agreement 
given the acquisition is subject to completion of the hotel by the third party developer and customary closing conditions  we can give no assurance that the acquisition will be consummated 
failure to complete this acquisition could subject us to risks relating to the recovery of the amount of the bridge financing we have provided  and cause us to incur costs in our efforts to make such recoveries 

table of contents capital expenditures we maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the franchisor s standards and the agreed upon requirements in our management and loan agreements 
the cost of all such routine improvements and alterations will be paid out of property improvement reserves  which will be funded by a portion of each hotel s gross revenues 
routine capital expenditures will be administered by the management companies 
however  we will have approval rights over the capital expenditures as part of the annual budget process 
from time to time  certain of our hotels may be undergoing renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotels  such as guestrooms  meeting space  and or restaurants  in order to better compete with other hotels in our markets 
in addition  often after we acquire a hotel  we are required to complete a property improvement plan pip in order to bring the hotel up to the respective franchisor s standards 
if permitted by the terms of the management agreement  funding for a renovation will first come from the ff e reserve 
to the extent that the ff e reserve is not adequate to cover the cost of the renovation  we will fund the remaining portion of the renovation with cash and cash equivalents on hand or available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
there were no other material off balance sheet arrangements at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years revolving credit facility  including interest term loan  including interest other mortgage loans  including interest corporate office lease ground leases assumes no additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility and interest payments on the revolving credit facility and term loan are based on the interest rate in effect as of december  also assumes that no extension options are exercised 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility and term loan 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is generally lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in the winter months 
we expect that our operations will generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
accordingly  we expect that we will have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
these general trends are  however  expected to be greatly influenced by overall economic cycles 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investments in hotels we allocate the purchase prices of hotels acquired based on the fair value of the acquired property  ff e  and identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of the liabilities assumed 
in making estimates of fair value for 
table of contents purposes of allocating the purchase price  we utilize a number of sources of information that are obtained in connection with the acquisition of a hotel  including valuations performed by independent third parties and cost segregation studies 
we also consider information obtained about each hotel as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
hotel acquisition costs  such as transfer taxes  title insurance  environmental and property condition reviews  and legal and accounting fees  are expensed in the period incurred 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally to years for buildings and building improvements and three to ten years for ff e 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets 
replacements and improvements at the hotels are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
upon the sale or retirement of a property and equipment  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets are recorded on non market contracts  including air rights and lease  management and franchise agreements  assumed as part of the acquisition of certain hotels 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the market rates for corresponding contracts measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contracts acquired 
no value is allocated to market contracts assumed 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related contracts 
we review our hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our hotels due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss is recognized 
share based compensation from time to time  we grant restricted share awards to employees and trustees 
to date  we have granted two types of restricted share awards time based awards and performance based awards 
we measure share based compensation expense for the restricted share awards based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of time based awards is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the measurement date  which is generally the date of grant 
the fair value of performance based awards is determined using a monte carlo simulation performed by a third party valuation specialist 
a monte carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions  including historical volatility and correlation of the price of our common shares and the price of the common shares of our peer group  a risk free rate of return  and an expected term 
for time based awards  share based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the entire award 
for performance based awards  share based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each award 
for both time based awards and performance based awards  once the total amount of share based compensation expense is determined on the date of the grant  no adjustments are made to the amount recognized each period 
no share based compensation expense is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
revenue recognition hotel revenues  including room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we earn interest income from cash and cash equivalent balances 
based on our cash and cash equivalents as of december   if interest rates increase or decrease by  our interest income will increase or decrease by approximately million annually  respectively 
as of december   we had million of debt outstanding from borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
as of that date  amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus the spread over libor based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
if prevailing libor on our debt under our revolving credit facility were to increase or decrease by  the increase or decrease in interest expense on our debt would increase or decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually  assuming that the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility was to remain at million  the balance at december
