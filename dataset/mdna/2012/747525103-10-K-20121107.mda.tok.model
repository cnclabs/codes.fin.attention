item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent developments revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income of billion  which were impacted by the following key items we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma and ofdma based wireless devices  an increase of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in fiscal total reported device sales were approximately billion  an increase of approximately  compared to approximately billion in fiscal on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of our mhz spectrum for billion  and as a result  we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of billion during the second quarter of fiscal against this backdrop  the following recent developments occurred during fiscal with respect to key elements of our business or our industry worldwide wireless connections grew by approximately to reach approximately billion 
worldwide g connections all cdma based grew by approximately to approximately billion  which was approximately of total wireless subscriptions  including approximately million cdma x xev do subscriptions and approximately billion wcdma hspa td scdma subscriptions 
some customers built devices that incorporated two msm integrated circuits 
in such cases  which represent approximately of our gross volume  we count only one msm integrated circuit in reporting the msm integrated circuit shipments 
total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in us dollars as reported to us by our licensees of all licensed cdma based  ofdma based and multimode cdma ofdma subscriber devices including handsets  modules  modem cards and other subscriber devices by our licensees during a particular period collectively  g g devices 
not all licensees report sales the same way eg  some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions  such as transportation  insurance and packing costs  while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports  and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time 
total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period 
according to wireless intelligence estimates as of november   for the quarter ending september  wireless intelligence estimates for cdma x xev do connections do not include wireless local loop 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on cdma  ofdma and other technologies 
we derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products  fixed license fees payable in one or more installments and ongoing royalties for use of our intellectual property  and fees for messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing  and related services and software hosting services 
operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services revenues and research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments qct  qtl  qwi and qsi 
qct is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on cdma  ofdma and other technologies for use in voice and data communications  networking  application processing  multimedia and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  tablets  laptops  data modules  handheld wireless computers and gaming devices  access points and routers  data cards and infrastructure equipment  and in wired devices  particularly broadband gateway equipment  desktop computers  televisions and blu ray players 
the msm integrated circuits  which include the mobile data modem  qualcomm single chip and qualcomm snapdragon processor based devices  perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications  as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions 
in addition  our snapdragon processors provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities 
qct s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have been assembled into packages or modules and have completed the final test manufacturing processes 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits 
turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
under the two stage manufacturing model  we purchase wafers and die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third party manufacturers for probe  assembly and final test services 
qtl grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which  among other rights  includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd including td scdma  gsm gprs edge and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale ie  licensee s selling price of licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg  certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  etc qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees sales of cdma and wcdma subscriber equipment products 
qwi  which includes our qes  qis  qgov and firethorn divisions  generates revenues primarily through sales of products  services including software development and software aimed at the support and delivery of wireless applications 
qes sells integrated wireless systems and services to transportation and logistics companies to manage their assets and workforce 
qis provides content enablement services for the wireless industry  including its brew  plaza and other products and services 
qis also provides qchat push to talk and other software products and services for wireless operators 
qgov provides development and other services and related products involving wireless communications technologies to government agencies and their contractors 
firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable mobile commerce services 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi makes strategic investments that we believe will open new opportunities for our technologies  support the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology 
many of these strategic investments are in early stage companies 
qsi also holds wireless spectrum  including the broadband wireless access bwa spectrum held by our subsidiaries bwa subsidiaries that were established to operate a wireless network in india 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we intend to pursue various exit strategies from each of our qsi investments at some point in the future 
the assets and liabilities of the bwa subsidiaries are presented as held for sale at september  as a result of our agreement with bharti airtel limited bharti  which provides that bharti s ownership interest in the bwa subsidiaries will increase over time to if certain conditions are met 
in addition  the results of qsi s flo tv business are presented as discontinued operations and are therefore not included in qsi s segment revenues or loss before income taxes 
nonreportable segments are comprised of display and other product and services initiatives  including our qmt division 
qmt continues to develop an interferometric modulator imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical system mems structure combined with thin film optics 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we updated the business plan and related internal forecasts for our qmt division to reflect a focus on licensing our next generation imod display technology while directly commercializing only certain imod products 
as a result  we tested the qmt division s goodwill and other long lived assets for impairment and concluded that the fair value of the qmt reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and that the carrying values of qmt s long lived asset groups were recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we revised our plans with respect to certain equipment comprising an asset group and recorded an impairment charge of million 
discontinued operations on march   the flo tv business and network were shut down 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of our mhz spectrum for billion  and as a result  we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of billion during the second quarter of fiscal all remaining assets have been considered disposed of since march   the date on which the assets ceased to be used 
since the shut down of the flo tv business and network  we have been working to sell the remaining assets and exit contracts 
accordingly  the results of operations of the flo tv business are presented as discontinued operations 
income loss from discontinued operations includes share based compensation and excludes certain general corporate expenses allocated to the flo tv business during the periods presented 
summarized results from discontinued operations were as follows in millions year ended september  september  september  revenues income loss from discontinued operations income tax expense benefit discontinued operations  net of income taxes looking forward the deployment of g networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks  thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets  g connected computing devices and other consumer electronics 
according to the global mobile suppliers association gsa  as of november  to complement their existing g networks  more than wireless operators have deployed and more than wireless operators are planning to deploy ofdma based technology  often called g  in new wireless spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services 
as a result  we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for g and g g multimode products and services around the world 
in addition  we expect an increasing number of devices  such as computers  consumer electronics and networking equipment  to require multiple communications technologies to support a variety of connected applications 
as we look forward to the next several months  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business the worldwide transition from g to g and g g networks is expected to continue  including the further expansion of g in china  india and other emerging regions 
we expect that the emergence of lower end smartphone products will contribute to such expansion 
we expect consumer demand for advanced g and g g multimode devices  including smartphones and data centric devices  such as tablets and e readers  to continue at a strong pace 
we expect that cdma based device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with active competition throughout the world at all price tiers 
additionally  varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger growth of cdma based device shipments in emerging regions  as compared to developed regions  are expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of cdma based devices 
we continue to invest significant resources toward the development of technologies and products for voice and data communications  primarily in the wireless industry  including advancements to g and g lte an ofdma based standard networks  wireless baseband chips  our converged computing communications snapdragon chips  multimedia products  software and services  as well as our imod and other display technologies 
we expect industry demand for nanometer integrated circuits to continue to be strong 
accordingly  even as we continue to increase our supply of nanometer integrated circuits  we may still experience supply shortages for our nanometer integrated circuit products during the early part of fiscal our qct business anticipates a strong first quarter in fiscal as the supply of nanometer integrated circuits increases and as new g and g g devices are launched for the holiday season 
in addition to the foregoing business and market based matters  we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  share based compensation  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products  licensing of our intellectual property and software  and sales of messaging  software hosting  software development and other services and related hardware 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
we license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products 
licensing revenues include license fees payable in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on licensees sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee  typically to years 
from time to time  licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons  and when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
we also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions 
at september   our goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and billion  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
for intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non monetary exchange  the estimated fair values of the assets received or  for non monetary exchanges  the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded values  except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment 
for example  the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows  total addressable market  pricing and share forecasts  competition  technology obsolescence  future tax rates and discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models 
new information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in goodwill impairment charges related to our firethorn division due to the operating performance of new product applications falling significantly short of expectations 
we hold investments in marketable securities  including equity securities  non investment grade debt securities  equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds  corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities and mortgage and asset backed securities 
the fair value of these investments totaled billion at september   with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss 
we record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
in addition  the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring impairment charges 
when assessing these investments for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost  the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class  negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others  the performance and pricing of the investee s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general  and analyst recommendations  as applicable 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
if we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary  we may record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities 
share based compensation 
share based compensation expense recognized during fiscal  and was billion  million and million  respectively 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date  or at the acquisition date for assumed awards  based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using a lattice binomial option pricing model and the fair value of stock option awards assumed using the black scholes option pricing model 
accordingly  the fair value of an option award as determined using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price on the valuation date as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options  we used the implied volatility of market traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the option pricing model 
the assumption inputs related to employee exercise behavior include estimates of the post vest forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factors  which are based on historical experience 
beginning in fiscal  we began to issue restricted stock units rsus to employees 
since such time  the number of stock options granted to employees has decreased  and we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future 
we estimate the fair value of rsus based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or date the awards are assumed 
if rsus do not have the right to participate in dividends  the fair value is discounted by the dividend yield 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
we are participating in the irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return 
a benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustments by the irs are less likely to occur 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
at september   net deferred tax assets were billion  which included a valuation allowance of million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions 
at september   we had unused federal  state and foreign net operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities  we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for these net operating losses 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made 
during fiscal  we established our qct segment s non united states headquarters in singapore 
we obtained tax incentives in singapore  including a tax exemption for the first five years provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria in singapore 
the location of qct s headquarters in singapore will not result in any change in foreign tax during the first five years  as compared to tax that would be owed under the previous structure of qct s non united states operations 
our singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal and again in fiscal as a result of expiration of these incentives 
we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states 
should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves 
however  the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations

equipment and services revenues  mostly related to sales of msm and accompanying rf and pm integrated circuits  were billion  billion and billion in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in equipment and services revenues in fiscal and resulted primarily from increases of billion and billion  respectively  related to higher unit shipments  increases of million and million  respectively  related to sales of connectivity products primarily resulting from the acquisition of atheros in the third quarter of fiscal and increases of million and million  respectively  related to the net effects of changes in product mix and lower selling prices of such products 
approximately million  million and million msm integrated circuits were sold during fiscal  and  respectively excluding the second msm for customers who built devices with two msms starting in fiscal 
the decreases in ebt as a percentage of revenues in fiscal and were primarily due to decreases in gross margin percentage  partially offset by the effects of higher increases in qct revenues relative to the increases in research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
qct gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal and as a result of the net effects of lower average selling prices  unfavorable product mix and higher product support costs  partially offset by a decrease in average unit costs 
the higher product support costs in fiscal primarily related to increased expenses incurred to facilitate additional supply of nanometer integrated circuits 
qct inventories increased by in fiscal from million to million primarily due to an increase in work in process and finished goods related to growth of the business 
during fiscal  we updated the method we use to quantify the dollar impact of changes in qct unit shipments as compared to the impact of changes in product mix and changes in product prices 
the information presented for the fiscal increase reflects the updated method

the million decrease in qsi loss before taxes from continuing operations in fiscal  excluding this charge  was primarily attributable to a million increase in net realized gains on investments and a million decrease in interest expense as a result of capitalizing interest starting in the third quarter of fiscal related to the bwa network in india 
qsi earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal included a million gain on the sale of our australia spectrum license 
the remaining million increase in qsi loss before taxes from continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense attributable to loans related to the bwa spectrum won in the india auction in june liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion at september   an increase of billion from september  this increase included billion in proceeds from the sale of substantially all of our mhz spectrum and billion in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  consisted of billion held domestically and billion held by foreign subsidiaries 
of the amount of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries at september   billion is indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated 
due to tax and accounting considerations  we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified investment and non investment grade fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents  marketable debt securities  debt funds and derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps 
changes in the general level of united states interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest bearing securities and the fair value of interest rate swaps held in connection with our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time  our fixed interest bearing securities could lose value 
when the general economy weakens significantly  the credit profile  financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate  and our interest bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily 
we may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk return trade offs that do not perform well 
the following table provides information about our interest bearing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and loans and debentures that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows  weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates 
we have assumed that the interest bearing securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate the securities for presentation purposes 
additionally  the table provides information about our derivative instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for such securities  the table presents the notional amount  weighted average yield and contractual maturity 
interest rate sensitivity principal or notional amount by expected maturity average interest rates dollars in millions thereafter no single maturity total fixed interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate trading securities interest rate other marketable securities interest rate time deposits interest rate interest rate swaps receive interest rate interest rate swaps pay interest rate floating interest bearing securities cash and cash equivalents interest rate trading securities interest rate other marketable securities interest rate interest rate swaps receive interest rate interest rate swaps pay interest rate loans and debentures interest rate denominated in indian rupees 
cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value 
the loans and debentures approximate fair value 
the debentures can be redeemed by us without penalty on certain dates 
additionally  each holder has the right to demand redemption of its portion of the debentures outstanding on june  subject to sufficient prior written notice 
equity price risk 
we hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk 
we have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size  style  industry and geography  and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at september  would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of million 
at september   gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were million 
although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur net other than temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties 
we utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes 
counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions 
in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments  we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us  which could have a negative impact on our results 
at september   we had a net asset of million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of cdma based devices 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in our hedged foreign currency  we would not incur a loss 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
at september   we had a net asset of million related to foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on intercompany payments of operating expenditures relating to a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
if our forecasted operating expenditures were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would not incur a loss 
at september   we had a net liability that was negligible related to foreign currency forwards  futures  options and swaps that were not designated as hedging instruments related to our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading 
if the foreign exchange rates relevant to these contracts were to change unfavorably by and we do not have an offset foreign currency exposure relating to debt instruments held in our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading  we would incur a loss of million 
at september   we had floating rate bank loans and debentures in the aggregate of billion  which are payable in full in indian rupees in december and june  respectively 
the loans and debentures are payable in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries that are party to the loans and debentures  however  we are subject to foreign currency translation risk  which may impact our liability for principal repayment and interest expense that we will record in the future 
if the foreign currency exchange rate were to change unfavorably by  we would incur additional principal of million and interest cost of million through the remainder of the contractual terms of the loans and debentures 
financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
