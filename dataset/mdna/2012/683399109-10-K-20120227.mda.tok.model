overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing innovative therapies that target the molecular mechanisms that cause cancer 
by applying our expertise to develop and commercialize therapies designed to exploit the genetic and molecular differences between cancer cells and normal cells  we have built two franchise platforms one in kinase inhibition and one in proteasome inhibition 
in our kinase inhibitor franchise  our lead product  nexavar sorafenib tablets is approved for unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
with our development and marketing partner bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc  or bayer  we share equally 
table of contents in the profits and losses of nexavar worldwide  except japan 
a second kinase inhibitor  regorafenib  is an investigational agent that has already demonstrated positive phase survival data in metastatic colorectal cancer  and is being evaluated in a phase study in gastrointestinal stromal tumors  or gist 
onyx will receive a twenty percent royalty on potential future global oncology sales of this bayer compound  if approved 
in our proteasome inhibitor franchise  our lead agent is carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with multiple myeloma and solid tumors 
carfilzomib is a late stage compound with the potential for accelerated marketing approval in the united states based on our current clinical trial data and assuming a favorable regulatory outcomes 
we are also developing two other novel proteasome inhibitors  including an oral protease inhibitor oprozomib onx and an immunoproteasome inhibitor onx 
in addition  we expect to continue to expand our development pipeline  with multiple clinical or preclinical stage product candidates 
our first commercially available product  nexavar sorafenib tablets  is approved by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
nexavar is a novel  orally available kinase inhibitor and is one of a class of anticancer treatments that target both cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth through the inhibition of key signaling pathways 
in december  nexavar became the first newly approved drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer in over a decade 
in november  nexavar was approved as the first and is currently the only systemic oral therapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer 
nexavar is now approved in more than countries for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
we and bayer are also conducting clinical trials of nexavar in several important cancer types in addition to advanced kidney cancer and unresectable liver cancer  including lung  thyroid  and breast cancers 
we and bayer are commercializing nexavar for the treatment of patients with unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
nexavar has been approved and is marketed for these indications globally 
in the united states  we co promote nexavar with bayer 
outside of the united states  bayer manages all commercialization activities 
for the years ended december   and  worldwide net sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer were billion  million and million  respectively 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our development efforts  the results of the nexavar clinical trials  the marketing of nexavar as a treatment for patients in approved indications  our dependence on collaborative parties  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
for a discussion of these and some of the other risks and uncertainties affecting our business  see item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
business highlights during  we continued to execute on our value building strategy by increasing worldwide sales of nexavar and investing in the development and pre launch commercialization of carfilzomib 
in september  we completed a new drug application nda submission to the us food and drug administration fda under the accelerated approval process for carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
onyx received a standard review designation from the fda for the application  with pdufa date set as july  in october we restructured our partnership with bayer healthcare for the global development and marketing of nexavar and entered into a new agreement related to regorafenib  a late stage oncology compound 
under the terms of the agreements  regorafenib is a bayer compound  and bayer will have the final decision making authority for global development and commercialization 
onyx is entitled to receive a twenty percent royalty on any future global net sales of regorafenib in oncology and will have the right to co promote regorafenib  with bayer  in the united states 
the status of nexavar under the revised collaboration agreement remains largely unchanged 
onyx and bayer are free to use their respective nexavar sales forces to promote regorafenib and additional products outside of the collaboration 
bayer has purchased onyx s royalty rights for sales of the product in japan in exchange for a one time payment  and will have no obligation to pay nexavar royalties to onyx on japanese sales after 
table of contents december  further  in the event of a change of control or acquisition of onyx  the profit sharing  co development and us co promotion rights related to nexavar will be preserved 
during the second quarter of  we moved to our new company headquarters at east grand avenue  south san francisco  california 
we entered into arrangements to lease and sublease these premises in july  and will continue to incur cash outlays associated with the lease and sublease of these premises 
the lease and subleased space totaled approximately  square feet at our new corporate headquarters in south san francisco  california 
the sublease lease and the lease expire in and in  approximately 
significant highlights of our or our collaborators product candidates included in september  the full results of our a study were used to file a new drug application nda under the accelerated approval process with the fda 
in december  the fda granted standard review designation to the new drug application nda for carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
we advanced enrollment in two phase trials to evaluate the efficacy of carfilzomib in multiple myeloma patients 
one trial  referred to as the aspire trial  will evaluate carfilzomib in combination with lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone  versus lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone alone 
the other trial  referred to as the focus trial will evaluate carfilzomib monotherapy in refractory multiple myeloma patients using best supportive care as the comparator 
we completed enrollment in two trials to evaluate the efficacy of nexavar in hepatocellular carcinoma hcc  or liver cancer  patients 
one trial  referred to as the storm trial  is a phase clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of nexavar as an adjuvant therapy for patients with liver cancer who have undergone resection or loco regional treatment with curative intent 
in early  we also completed enrollment in another phase trial  referred to as the search trial  which will examine nexavar tablets in combination with tarceva erlotinib tablets as a potential new treatment option for patients with advanced hcc 
a second kinase inhibitor regorafenib  a bayer compound  is an investigational agent that has already demonstrated positive phase survival data in metastatic colorectal cancer  and is being evaluated in a phase study in gastrointestinal stromal tumors  or gist 
we completed enrollment in a phase trial  referred to as the mission trial  which will evaluate the efficacy of nexavar tablets in patients with relapsed or refractory advanced predominantly non squamous nsclc who have failed two or three previous treatments 
we also completed enrollment in a phase trial  referred to as decision trial  which will evaluate the efficacy of nexavar tablets in patients who have received no prior systemic therapy 
financial highlights sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer increased to billion in from million in  and nexavar margins improved in as compared to our operating results for the year included contract revenue from collaboration of million related to the sale of the nexavar royalty stream in japan 
in addition  revenue from the nexavar collaboration agreement of million represents an increase of million  or  from million in  driven primarily by increased sales of nexavar in the asia pacific region 
total operating expenses for the year were million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a benefit as a result of a decrease in the fair value of the non current contingent consideration liability for estimated amounts payable to former proteolix 
offsetting this benefit was an increase in research and development expenses for the development of carfilzomib  particularly the phase aspire and focus trials 
cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities at december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million at december   primarily due to million received in connection with the bayer settlement offset by higher operating expenses 

table of contents outlook our initiatives for fiscal year are intended to promote the development of carfilzomib  the growth of nexavar and the growth of our development pipeline 
we expect to complete enrollment in the phase aspire trial for carfilzomib  to continue enrollment in the phase focus trial for carfilzomib  and to initiate one or more additional phase carfilzomib clinical trials 
we also expect to advance the currently enrollment phase b clinical trial for onx we expect to continue to support clinical activities for the development of nexavar in liver cancer  breast cancer  lung cancer and thyroid cancer 
in  we expect data from several clinical trials  including the phase mission trial for treatment of patients with non small cell lung cancer and the phase decision trial for treatment of patients with radioactive iodine refractory  locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer 
we are mindful that conditions in our current macroeconomic environment could affect our ability to achieve our goals  including healthcare policy changes in the united states and continued government pricing pressures internationally 
we will continue to monitor these factors and will adjust our business processes to mitigate these risks to our business 
the successes we experienced in have helped us execute our strategy and as we continue to grow our business and achieve greater operational leverage  we remain focused on nexavar revenue growth  development of carfilzomib and disciplined expense management that we believe will enable execution of our operating objectives for critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
significant estimates used in include assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of marketable securities  revenue from collaboration agreement  multiple element arrangements  the effect of business combinations  fair value measurement of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  goodwill and other intangible assets  fair value of convertible senior notes  research and development expenses  stock based compensation and the provision for income taxes 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities marketable securities consist primarily of corporate debt securities  corporate commercial paper  debt securities of united states government agencies  auction rate notes and money market funds and are classified as available for sale securities 
concentration of risk is limited by diversifying investments among a variety of industries and issuers 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices  with any unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for securities with unobservable quoted market prices  such as the aaa rated auction rate securities collateralized by student loans that are included in our investment portfolio  the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease in value 
alternatively  a decrease in either of these assumptions could result in a million increase in value 
unrealized losses are charged against investment income when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to i the extent to which the fair value is less than cost and the cause for the fair value decline  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position and iv our ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any 
table of contents anticipated recovery in fair value 
we do not intend to sell our marketable securities and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell our marketable securities prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases 
available for sale securities with initial maturities of greater than one year are classified as long term 
the amortized cost of securities in this category is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
such amortization is included in interest income 
the cost of securities sold or the amount reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income into earnings is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are included in the statements of operations 
interest earned and gains realized on marketable securities  amortization of discounts received and accretion of premiums paid on the purchase of marketable securities are included in investment income 
revenue from collaboration agreement in accordance with accounting standards codification asc subtopic  collaborative arrangements  we record our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from the collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue in one line item  revenue from collaboration agreement 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in the line item revenue from collaboration agreement  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
we and bayer each bear our own us sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these costs related to our us sales force and medical science liaisons are recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
bayer recognizes all revenue under the nexavar collaboration and incurs the majority of expenses relating to the development and marketing of nexavar 
we are highly dependent on bayer for timely and accurate information regarding any revenues realized from sales of nexavar and the costs incurred in developing and selling it  in order to accurately report our results of operations 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material changes to prior period estimates of revenues and expenses 
however  if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
multiple element arrangements beginning in  we account for multiple element arrangements  such as license and development agreements in which a customer may purchase several deliverables  in accordance with accounting standard update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  for these multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each non contingent element based upon the relative selling price of each element 
when applying the relative selling price method  we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  or third party evidence tpe of selling price  if it exists 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for a deliverable  we use best estimated selling price besp for that deliverable 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized based on when the basic four revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in an arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
business combinations we accounted for the acquisition of proteolix in in accordance with asc topic  business combinations 
asc topic establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring the total consideration transferred to and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquired target in a business combination 
the consideration paid to acquire proteolix is required to be measured at fair value and included cash consideration and contingent consideration  which are earn out payments that will be paid upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
after the total consideration transferred was calculated by determining the fair value of the contingent consideration plus the cash consideration  we assigned the purchase price of proteolix to the fair value assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this resulted in recognition of intangible assets related to in process research and development ipr d projects and goodwill 
the determination and allocation of the consideration transferred requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration and intangible assets acquired 
we believe the fair values assigned to 
table of contents our liability for contingent consideration and acquired intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition dates 
discounted cash flow models are used in valuing these assets and liabilities  and these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to estimated cash flows projected from the success of unapproved product candidates  the probability of technical and regulatory success ptrs for unapproved product candidates considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risk associated with uncertainty  achievement and payment of the milestone events 
in determining the probability of technical and regulatory success  we utilized data regarding similar milestone events from several sources  including industry studies 
we based the time needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates on the current stages of development of the product candidates  resources needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates and the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate  such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals 
inputs related to the time needed to complete the development and approval of product candidates is highly judgmental as they are not readily determinable because the drug development process can be unpredictable 
we established a discount rate based on future cash flows that would be required by a market participant for similar instruments  based on the estimated cost of capital and the inherent risk premium associated with repayment 
that discount rate  representative of the rate of return required by a market participant  has been determined by us to be  and has been applied to the contingent payment amounts to determine their present values 
changes to any of these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for these assets and liabilities resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
as a result of the acquisition of proteolix in november under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  or the merger agreement  which was entered into in october  we made a payment of million in april and may be required to pay up to an additional million payable in up to four earn out payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals for carfilzomib in the us and europe within pre specified timeframes 
the liability for contingent consideration relates to the four remaining earn out payments with a fair value of million at december  based upon a discounted cash flow model that uses significant estimates and assumptions  including the ptrs of the product candidate  carfilzomib 
for the year ended december   the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability resulted in a million benefit recognized based upon the revised probability weighted discounted cash flow 
in a letter received december   the us food and drug administration fda notified onyx that they had granted standard review designation to the new drug application nda for carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
the prescription drug user fee act pdufa date for completion of review by the fda of the nda is july  in this letter  the agency advised the company that recent oncology drug advisory committee recommendations specify a preference for phase trials for the accelerated approval pathway 
based on its preliminary review and ongoing assessment of the application  the fda outlined potential review issues including whether the application is sufficient to support an fda conclusion that the data provided within the nda meets accelerated approval criteria and whether the benefit and risk are appropriately balanced  given that the application is based on a single arm study 
as a result of this information  the liability associated with a potential future milestone payment triggered by accelerated marketing approval for carfilzomib in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma was 
table of contents reduced to a maximum of million  and the estimated probability of receiving accelerated regulatory approval in the us was reduced 
in addition  contingent consideration liability associated with a potential million payment triggered by marketing approval for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the european union was removed  because based on current development timelines  onyx does not expect approval will be obtained before the december  milestone expiration date 
as a result of these reductions in the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration  a benefit of million was recorded for full year any further changes to these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for this liability resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statements of operations 
changes in the contingent consideration liability are indicative of additional information becoming available at different balance sheet dates 
the regulatory approval of carfilzomib in the us and in europe  is largely outside of our control  and requires significant judgment 
since the ptrs by a specified milestone date could have a significant impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration liability  it is possible that there may be significant changes to the contingent consideration liability in the future 
it may also not be possible to accurately predict the outcome of a regulatory approval in the us or europe by a specified milestone date 
even though the fda provides a pdufa date  this is not indicative of the date they will provide their decision whether regulatory approval will be announced 
management has used all information available to them at each balance sheet date to determine the appropriate ptrs in calculating their best estimate of the contingent consideration liability 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with asc topic  and asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
asc topic requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations and specifies the criteria that must be met in order for intangible assets acquired in a business combination to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
our intangible assets and goodwill are determined to have indefinite lives and  therefore  are not amortized 
instead they are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances occur that indicate impairment might have occurred in accordance with asc topic through december   no impairment has been identified 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators will be based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or our overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
in the future  events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain other intangibles with determinable lives and other long lived assets are impaired resulting in an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
convertible senior notes in august  we issued  through an underwritten public offering  million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes 
the notes are accounted for in accordance with asc subtopic  debt with conversion and other options 
under asc subtopic issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature and may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the carrying amount of the liability component of the notes  as of the issuance date  was computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability issued at a effective interest rate  which was determined by considering the rate of return investors would require in our capital structure as well as taking into consideration effective interest rates derived by comparable companies 
the amount of the equity component was calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the notes and results in a corresponding increase to debt discount 
subsequently  the debt discount is amortized as interest expense through the maturity date of the notes 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation of stock options granted to employees and directors and of employee stock purchase plan shares by estimating the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes option pricing model and amortizing the fair value of the stock based awards granted over the applicable vesting period 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
we estimate expected volatility based upon a combination of historical and implied stock prices 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the expected option term calculation incorporates historical employee exercise behavior and post vesting employee termination rates 
we account for stock based com 
table of contents pensation of restricted stock award grants by amortizing the fair value of the restricted stock awards grants  which is the grant date market price  over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for restricted stock and stock option awards that contain performance or market conditions is based on the grant date fair value of the award 
compensation expense is recorded over the implicit or explicit requisite service period based on management s best estimate as to whether it is probable that the shares awarded are expected to vest 
previously recognized compensation expense is fully reversed if performance targets are not satisfied 
the company assesses the probability of the performance indicators being met on a continuous basis and records compensation expense from that date  over the remainder of the requisite service period 
net income loss for the years ended december   and includes employee stock based compensation expense of million  or per diluted share  million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
as of december   the total unrecorded stock based compensation expense for unvested stock options  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   the total unrecorded expense for unvested restricted stock awards  net of expected forfeitures  was million  which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
all stock option awards to non employees are accounted for at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  as calculated using the black scholes model 
the option arrangements are subject to periodic remeasurement over their vesting terms 
we recorded compensation expense related to option grants to non employees of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock based awards reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
in addition  our estimate of future stock based compensation expense will be affected by a number of items including our stock price  the number of stock options our board of directors may grant in future periods  as well as a number of complex and subjective valuation adjustments and the related tax effect 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used  the stock based compensation expense that was recorded for the years ended december   and could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
research and development expense research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  preclinical study expenses  clinical trial expenses  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
preclinical study expenses include  but are not limited to  costs incurred for the laboratory evaluation of a product candidate s chemistry and its biological activities and costs incurred to assess the potential safety and efficacy of a product candidate and its formulations 
clinical trial expenses include  but are not limited to  investigator fees  site costs  comparator drug costs and clinical research organization costs 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites  cooperative groups and clinical research organizations 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
we monitor service provider activities to the extent possible  however  if we incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods 

table of contents in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for clinical trials and other consulting activities  up front payment amounts are capitalized and expensed as services are performed or as the underlying goods are delivered 
if we do not expect the services to be rendered or goods to be delivered  any remaining capitalized amounts for non refundable up front payments are charged to expense immediately 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
non refundable option payments  including those previously made under our agreement with s bio  that do not have any future alternative use are recorded as research and development expense 
not all research and development costs are incurred by us 
a portion of our total research and development expenses  approximately in  in and in  relates to our cost sharing arrangement with bayer and represents our share of the research and development costs incurred by bayer 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer  there was a net reimbursable amount of million  million and million to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material differences between actual amounts and estimates 
however  if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets  and record a valuation allowance that reduces the deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and the amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against most of our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we reassess our valuation allowance for deferred income taxes 
we will consider reducing the valuation allowance when it becomes more likely than not the benefit of those assets will be realized 
as part of our accounting for the acquisition of proteolix in  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible  therefore  deferred taxes have been recorded for future non deductible amortization expenses related to intangible assets as a part of the business combination 
in the event of an impairment charge associated with goodwill  such charges are generally not tax deductible and would increase the effective tax rate in the quarter any impairment is recorded 
asc also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted this guidance on uncertain tax positions on january  under this guidance  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position would be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
nexavar is our only marketed product 
in accordance with our collaboration agreement with bayer  bayer recognizes all revenue from the sale of nexavar 
as such  for the years ended december   and  we reported no product revenue related to nexavar 
nexavar net sales as recorded by bayer were billion  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily from sales in the united states  the european union  asia pacific and other territories worldwide 
revenue from collaboration agreement 
nexavar is currently approved in more than countries worldwide for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer 
we co promote nexavar in the united states with bayer under collaboration and co promotion agreements 
under the terms of the co promotion agreement and consistent with the collaboration agreement  we and bayer share equally in the profits or losses of nexavar  if any  in the united states  subject only to our continued co funding of the development costs of nexavar worldwide outside of japan and our continued co promotion of nexavar in the united states 
outside of the united states  excluding japan  bayer incurs all of the sales and marketing expenditures  and we reimburse bayer for half of those expenditures 
in addition  for sales generated outside of the united states  excluding japan  we reimburse bayer a fixed percentage of sales for their marketing infrastructure 
research and development expenditures on a worldwide basis  excluding japan  are equally shared by both companies regardless of whether we or bayer incurs the expense 
in japan  bayer is responsible for all development and marketing costs and we received a royalty on net sales of nexavar through december  under this fourth amendment to the collaboration agreement  bayer will have no obligation to pay royalties to onyx for sales of nexavar in japan for any period after december  in the united sates  bayer provides all product distribution and all marketing support services for nexavar  including managed care  customer service  order entry and billing 
we compensate bayer for distribution expenses based on a fixed percentage of gross sales of nexavar in the united states 
we reimburse bayer for half of its expenses for marketing services provided by bayer for the sale of nexavar in the united states 
we and bayer share equally in any other out of pocket marketing expenses other than expenses for sales force and medical science liaisons that we and bayer incur in connection with the marketing and promotion of nexavar in the united states 
bayer manufactures all nexavar sold and is reimbursed at an agreed transfer price per unit for the cost of goods sold in the united states 
in the united states  we contribute half of the overall number of sales force personnel required to market and promote nexavar and half of the medical science liaisons to support nexavar 
we and bayer each bear our own sales force and medical science liaison expenses 
these expenses are not included in the calculation of the profits or losses of the collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement consists of our share of the pre tax commercial profit generated from our collaboration with bayer  reimbursement of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue 
under the collaboration  bayer recognizes all sales of nexavar worldwide 
revenue from collaboration agreement is derived by calculating net sales of nexavar to third party customers and deducting the cost of goods sold  distribution costs  marketing costs including without limitation  advertising and education expenses  selling and promotion expenses  marketing personnel expenses and bayer marketing services expenses  phase clinical trial costs and allocable overhead costs 
reimbursement by bayer of our shared marketing costs related to nexavar and royalty revenue are also included in the revenue from collaboration agreement line item 
our portion of shared collaboration research and development expenses is not included in the revenue from collaboration agreement line item  but is reflected under operating expenses 
according to the terms of the collaboration agreement  the companies share all research and development  marketing and non us sales expenses 
non us sales force and medical science liaison expenditures incurred by both companies are borne by each company separately and are not included in the calculation 
some of the revenue and expenses used to derive the revenue from collaboration agreement during the period presented are estimates of both parties and are subject to further 
table of contents adjustment based on each party s final review should actual results differ from these estimates 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material changes to prior period estimates of revenues and expenses 
however  if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration of nexavar at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods and may be required to restate our results for prior periods 
revenue from collaboration agreement increases with increased nexavar net revenue  or decreases with decreased nexavar net revenue  over and above the associated cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expenses 
increases to the associated costs of goods sold  distribution  selling and general and administrative expenses will decrease revenue from collaboration agreement and decreases to these costs will increase revenue from collaboration agreement 
additionally  prolonged or profound economic downturn may result in adverse changes to product reimbursement and pricing and sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
we expect nexavar sales and bayer s and our shared cost of goods sold  distribution  selling and general administrative expense to increase as bayer continues to expand nexavar marketing and sales activities outside of the united states  particularly from certain asia pacific countries 
revenue from collaboration agreement was million  million and million and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in revenue from collaboration agreement is primarily a result of increased net product revenue on sales of nexavar as recorded by bayer of billion for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this represents an increase of million  or and million  or  over nexavar net sales recorded by bayer for the previous years 
nexavar product sales are primarily in the united states  countries in the european union  japan and china and other territories worldwide 
the increase in revenue from collaboration is primarily as a result of increased sales in the unites states  certain countries in the european union and in the asian pacific region 
in addition  collaboration commercial profit increased to as a percentage of nexavar revenue subject to profit sharing in from in increasing the revenue from collaboration 
revenue from collaboration agreement is calculated as follows year ended december  in thousands nexavar product revenue  net as recorded by bayer nexavar revenue subject to profit sharing as recorded by bayer combined cost of goods sold  distribution  selling  general and administrative expenses combined collaboration commercial profit onyx s share of collaboration commercial profit reimbursement of onyx s shared marketing expenses royalty revenue revenue from collaboration agreement license revenue 
license revenue  as compared to prior years  was as follows for the year ending december  change vs change vs in thousands  except percentages license revenue 
table of contents in september  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with ono granting ono the right to develop and commercialize both carfilzomib and oprozomib for all oncology indications in japan 
we retain development and commercialization rights for all other countries of the world 
in accordance with asc revenue recognition  we identified the license as one of the non contingent deliverables under this agreement with stand alone value 
because vsoe or tpe of selling price for this element was unavailable  we utilized besp to apply the relative selling price method to allocate revenue to this element 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product were sold on a stand alone basis 
therefore  besp for the license is based on discounted future projected cash flows relating to the licensed territory 
revenue allocated to the license of million was recognized in september when all related knowledge and data had been transferred 
contract revenue from collaboration 
contract revenue from collaboration  as compared to prior years  was as follows for the year ending december  change vs change vs in thousands  except percentages contract revenue from collaboration on october   we and bayer also entered into a fourth amendment to our original collaboration agreement in which bayer agreed to pay us a one time lump sum of million and in exchange bayer will have no obligation to pay royalties to us for sales of nexavar in japan for any period after december  bayer may also be required to make future payments to us of up to an aggregate of million in and based on future product pricing in japan 
we recognized the revenue from the sale of the royalty revenue stream in because we have no future obligations under this arrangement 
contract revenue from collaborations in relates to a milestone fee earned when pfizer initiated phase clinical testing to advance a lead candidate from our previous cell cycle kinase discovery collaboration 
research and development expenses 
the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
clinical trial expenses include  but are not limited to  investigator fees  site costs  comparator drug costs and clinical research organization costs 
in addition  our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial sites and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 
if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
research and development expenses  as compared to prior years  were as follows for the year ending december  change vs change vs in thousands  except percentages research and development 
table of contents research and development expenses include costs to develop our product candidates and our share of the research and development costs incurred for nexavar by bayer and us under our cost sharing arrangement 
the increase in research and development expenses compared to is primarily due to investments in the development of carfilzomib  including salaries and related costs for increased personnel hired in  advancing our clinical products particularly relating to our ongoing phase clinical trials  referred to as aspire including comparator drug costs  and focus  and the expense of manufacturing carfilzomib in anticipation of a potential commercial launch 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a million reimbursement received from ono 
under the terms of the license agreement with ono  a percentage of the global development costs we incur for the development of carfilzomib and oprozomib is reimbursed by ono 
in addition  research and development expenses during  included a million write off of the remaining balance of the advance funding provided to s bio in may research and development expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in due to increased personnel hired in a significant portion of our total research and development expenses  approximately for  relates to the further development of carfilzomib  compared to and for and  respectively

our share of the research and development costs incurred for nexavar include  and of the costs incurred by bayer for nexavar for  and  respectively 
as a result of the cost sharing arrangement between us and bayer for research and development costs  there were net reimbursable amounts of million  million and million due to bayer for the years ended december   and  respectively 
such amounts were recorded based on invoices and estimates we receive from bayer 
when such invoices have not been received  we must estimate the amounts owed to bayer based on discussions with bayer 
for the periods covered in the financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material differences between actual amounts and estimates 
however  if we underestimate or overestimate the amounts owed to bayer  we may need to adjust these amounts in a future period  which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment 
as of december   our share of the nexavar development costs incurred to date under the collaboration was million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially in future periods  primarily as a result of anticipated costs to develop carfilzomib 
we are currently conducting phase  phase and phase b studies in relapsed multiple myeloma  a phase b study in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and phase b studies in multiple myeloma and relapsed solid tumors 
we also expect our research and development activities to include developing other product candidates 
additionally  we expect that bayer and we will continue to invest in the development of nexavar 
the increase in research and development expenses compared to is primarily due to increases to further develop carfilzomib 
research and development expenses in also included million in expenses related to the amortization of the million payment made to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by an million reimbursement received from ono and by lower expenses for the onx program compared to  when a milestone payment of million was made to btg international limited 
under the terms of the license agreement with ono  a percentage of the global development costs we incur for the development of carfilzomib and oprozomib is reimbursed by ono 
research and development expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in the major components of research and development costs include clinical manufacturing costs  clinical trial expenses  non refundable upfront payments  consulting and other third party costs  salaries and employee benefits  stock based compensation expense  supplies and materials and allocations of various overhead and occupancy costs 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential product candidates 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential 
table of contents target and includes proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans  each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled phase of development estimated completion is only our estimate of the timing of completion of the current in process development phases based on current information 
the actual timing of completion of those phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of completion of each clinical phase of our development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical product candidates 
the clinical development portion of these programs may span as many as seven to ten years  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainty of future preclinical and clinical study results and uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as marketing

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits  consulting  advertising and promotion expenses  legal costs  other third party costs  corporate functional expenses and allocations for overhead and occupancy costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as compared to prior years were as follows for the year ending december  change vs change vs in thousands  except percentages selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses compared to was primarily due to planned increases in employee headcount and related costs across all departments to support our planned growth  legal costs incurred in primarily for our lawsuit with bayer  prudent pre launch commercial costs for carfilzomib and increased facilities related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included stock based compensation of million in  compared to million in we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase further due to increases in personnel and due to preparations for the potential launches of carfilzomib in various territories 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses compared to is primarily due to planned increases in spending as a result of the acquisition of proteolix  an increase in external commercial expenses and an increase in employee related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included stock based compensation of million in compared to million in contingent consideration expense 
contingent consideration expense  as compared to prior years  was as follows for the year ending december  vs vs in thousands  except percentages contingent consideration as a result of the acquisition of proteolix in november under the terms of an agreement and plan of merger  or the merger agreement  which was entered into in october  we made a payment of million in april and may be required to pay up to an additional million payable in up to four earn out payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory approvals for carfilzomib in the us and europe within pre specified timeframes 
in january  we entered into amendment no 
to the merger agreement  or the amendment 
under the original merger agreement  the first of these additional earn out payments would have been in the amount of million if achieved by december   and would have been triggered by accelerated marketing approval for carfilzomib in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma 
as of december   we are no longer obligated to pay the earn out payment of million  since the milestone date has passed without the milestone having been achieved 
however  the amendment modifies this payment if the milestone is not achieved by the date originally contemplated on a sliding scale basis  as follows if accelerated marketing approval in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma is achieved after the date originally contemplated  but within six months of the original date or june   subject to extension under certain circumstances  then the amount payable will be reduced to million  and if accelerated marketing approval in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma is achieved more than six months after the date originally contemplated  but within months of the original date or december   subject to extension under certain circumstances  then the amount payable will be reduced to million 
the remaining earnout payments will continue to become payable in up to three additional installments as follows million would be triggered by marketing approval on or before december  in the european union for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma  
table of contents million would be triggered by marketing approval on or before march  in the united states for relapsed multiple myeloma  and million would be triggered by marketing approval on or before march  for relapsed multiple myeloma in the european union 
we recorded a liability for this contingent consideration related to the four earn out payments with a fair value of million at december  based upon a discounted cash flow model that uses significant estimates and assumptions  including the probability of technical and regulatory success ptrs of the product candidate  carfilzomib 
contingent consideration benefit expense is recorded for the change in the fair value of the recognized amount of the liability for contingent consideration 
during the year ended december   the company recorded a benefit of million  compared to contingent consideration expense of million and million in and respectively 
for the year ended december   the decrease in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability resulted from a million benefit recognized based upon the revised probability weighted discounted cash flow 
in a letter received december   the us food and drug administration fda notified onyx that they had granted standard review designation to the new drug application nda for carfilzomib for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
the prescription drug user fee act pdufa date for completion of review by the fda of the nda is july  in this letter  the agency advised the company that recent oncology drug advisory committee recommendations specify a preference for phase trials for the accelerated approval pathway 
our nda for accelerated approval of carfilzomib was based on a phase b trial 
also  based on its preliminary review and ongoing assessment of the application  the fda outlined potential review issues including whether the application is sufficient to support an fda conclusion that the data provided within the nda meets accelerated approval criteria and whether the benefit and risk are appropriately balanced  given that the application is based on a single arm study 
as a result of this information  the liability associated with a potential future milestone payment triggered by accelerated marketing approval for carfilzomib in the united states for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma was reduced to a maximum of million  and the estimated probability of receiving accelerated regulatory approval in the us was reduced 
in addition  contingent consideration liability associated with a potential million payment triggered by marketing approval for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the european union was removed  because based on current development timelines  onyx does not expect approval will be obtained before the december  milestone expiration date 
as a result of these reductions in the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration  a benefit of million was recorded for full year partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in the fair value of the non current liability for contingent consideration due to the passage of time 
any further changes to these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for this liability resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   the increase in the fair value of the non current liability primarily resulted from a million increase due to a change in the ptrs in the second quarter of  partially offset by a benefit recorded as a result of the amendment 
in june  positive data was presented for the carfilzomib trial  a phase b multicenter dose escalation study of carfilzomib plus lenalidomide and low dose dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients 
in july  positive data was also presented for the a carfilzomib trial  an open label  single arm phase b study of single agent carfilzomib in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients 
the data from the and a trials positively impacted the ptrs 
the remaining increase in the fair value of the non current liability for contingent consideration resulted from an million increase due to the passage of time 
any further changes to these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for this liability resulting in significant charges to our consolidated statements of operations 
lease termination exit cost 
as a result of the company s consolidation of its facilities  on may   the company ceased the use of facilities it previously occupied at powell street  emeryville  california and a portion of its facilities at allerton avenue  south san francisco  california 
during the fourth quarter of  following the acceptance of the nda filing for carfilzomib by the fda  the company reassessed the need 
table of contents for additional office space due to its ongoing development plans and reoccupied the remainder of the facility at allerton avenue  south san francisco  california 
in connection with its exit from these facilities  during  the company recorded total exit costs of approximately million  which includes million related to operating lease obligations  adjusted for the effects of deferred rent liability recognized under purchase accounting  million in other facility related costs and million in property and equipment write offs 
the estimated costs disclosed are based on a number of assumptions  and actual results could materially differ

investment income  net 
investment income consists of interest income and realized gains or losses from the sale of investments 
we had investment income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the same period in these decreases were primarily due to lower effective interest rates in the market as well as a change in the asset allocation of our investment portfolio 
our average cash balances in increased by million from  primarily as a result of million in cash received from bayer in the sale of the japan royalty stream for nexavar  which was partially offset by our increased operating expenses 
we had investment income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the same period in these decreases were primarily due to lower effective interest rates in the market as well as a change in the asset allocation of our investment portfolio 
excluding restricted cash of million attributable primarily to the escrow account for the acquisition of proteolix  which was paid to former proteolix stockholders in february  our average cash balances in decreased by million from  primarily as a result of a million payment to former proteolix shareholders in april for the achievement of a development milestone  a million payment to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx and a million interest payment on our notes  which were partially offset by million in license revenue received from ono

interest expense primarily relates to the convertible senior notes due issued in august  and includes non cash imputed interest expense of million in  million in and million in  as a result of the application of asc other expense 
other expense of million for the year ended december  primarily relates to a million expense recorded for the impairment of our equity investment in s bio 
income taxes 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision benefit for income taxes of million  million and million  respectively  related to continuing operations 
our tax expense was related primarily to federal alternative minimum tax and state income taxes 
as of december   our net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes were approximately million and million 
these net operating losses can be utilized to reduce future taxable income  if any 
approximately million of the federal and million of the state net operating loss carryforwards represent the stock option deduction arising from activity under our stock option plan  the benefit of which will increase additional paid in capital when realized 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through  and the state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in through and may be subject to certain limitations 
we also had research tax credit and orphan drug credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that expire beginning in through and million for california income tax purposes that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of  as amended and similar state provisions 
as a result of these provisions  utilization of our net operating losses would be limited in the event of any future significant ownership changes 
these annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards before utilization

table of contents acquired in process research and development intangible assets for in process research and development  or ipr d  consist of product candidates resulting from our acquisition of proteolix  including carfilzomib  oprozomib and onx we determined that the combined estimated fair values of carfilzomib  oprozomib and onx was million as of november   or the acquisition date 
we used an income approach  which is a measurement of the present value of the net economic benefit or cost expected to be derived from an asset or liability  to measure the fair value of carfilzomib and a cost approach to measure the fair values of oprozomib and onx under the income approach  an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the present value of the incremental after tax cash flows excess earnings attributable solely to the intangible asset over its remaining useful life 
under the cost approach  an intangible asset s fair value is equal to the costs incurred to date to develop the asset to its current stage 
to calculate fair value of carfilzomib under the income approach  we used probability weighted cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the inherent risks associated with this type of asset 
we estimated the fair value of this asset using a present value discount rate based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of proteolix 
this is comparable to the estimated internal rate of return for proteolix s operations and represents the rate that market participants would use to value this asset 
cash flows were generally assumed to extend either through or beyond the patent life of the asset  depending on the circumstances particular to the asset 
in addition  we compensated for the phase of development for this program by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows 
we believe that the level and timing of cash flows appropriately reflect market participant assumptions 
the projected cash flows from this project were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the project considering its stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidate  the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
the resultant probability weighted cash flows were then discounted using a rate we believe is appropriate and representative of a market participant assumption 
for the other two intangible assets acquired  oprozomib and  we used the costs incurred by proteolix to develop these assets to their current stage as their fair value as result of the lack of financial projections for these assets in their current development stages  at the acquisition date 
these ipr d programs represent proteolix s incomplete research and development projects which had not yet reached technological feasibility at acquisition 
a summary of these programs and estimated fair values at the acquisition date is as follows product candidates description estimated acquisition date fair value in thousands carfilzomib first in a new class of selective and irreversible proteasome inhibitors associated with prolonged target suppression  improved antitumor activity and low neurotoxicity for treatment against multiple myeloma and solid tumors

table of contents liquidity and capital resources with the exception of the profitability we achieved for the years ended december   and  we have incurred significant annual net losses since our inception and have relied primarily on public and private financing  combined with milestone payments we received from our collaborators  to fund our operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities of million compared to million at december  the increase of million was primarily attributable to a million payment received from bayer in october with the sale of the nexavar royalty stream in japan as well as a million increase in cash from our collaboration with bayer as a result of increased sales of nexavar 
offsetting this increase was an increase in our operating expenses in as well as a million interest payment on our notes 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and current and non current marketable securities of million  excluding million of restricted cash  compared to million at december  the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a million payment to former proteolix shareholders in april for the achievement of a development milestone  a million payment to s bio in may for the expansion and acceleration of the development collaboration program for onx and onx and a million interest payment on our notes  which were partially offset by million in license revenue received from ono

expenditures for capital equipment amounted to approximately million in  million in  and million in capital expenditures in were primarily for construction of facilities in south san francisco  california that we leased and subleased beginning in july and for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
please refer to note  commitments and contingencies of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
capital expenditures in and were primarily for equipment to accommodate our employee growth 
at december   our investment portfolio includes million aaa rated securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities that are collateralized by student loans 
since february  these types of securities have experienced failures in the auction process 
however  a limited number of these securities have been redeemed at par by the issuing agencies 
as a result of the auction failures  interest rates on these securities reset at penalty rates linked to libor or treasury bill rates 
the penalty rates are generally higher than interest rates set at auction 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  and our belief that the market for these student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified the auction rate securities with a par value of million as non current marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
we have determined the fair value to be million for these securities  based on a discounted cash flow model  and have reduced the carrying value of these marketable securities by million through accumulated other comprehensive income loss instead of earnings because we have deemed the impairment of these securities to be temporary 
further adverse developments in the credit market could result in an impairment charge through earnings in the future 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease in value 
alternatively  a decrease in either of these assumptions could result in a million increase in value 
currently  we believe these investments are not other than temporarily impaired as all of them are substantially backed by the federal government  but it is not clear in what period of time they will be settled 
we do not intend to sell the securities and we believe it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities 
table of contents prior to the recovery of their amortized cost bases 
we believe that  even after reclassifying these securities to non current assets and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs beyond we anticipate our operating costs to increase in as we continue to incur expenses towards the development of carfilzomib  oprozomib and onx in addition  the terms of the agreement and plan of merger for proteolix provide that we may be required to pay up to an additional million in earn out payments upon the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of other milestones 
in july  we entered into arrangements to lease and sublease a total of approximately  square feet located at east grand avenue  south san francisco  california 
the total monthly base rent in the first year for both the lease and sublease was approximately  beginning in september as of december   the total obligation lease obligations will be approximately million 
in november  we entered into arrangements to lease a total of approximately  square feet located at east grand avenue  south san francisco  california and anticipate that we will incur cash outlays associated with the lease of these premises 
the total monthly base rent in the first year for the lease is approximately million and is expected to begin in the total lease obligation will be approximately million 
as part of the lease  we paid a refundable deposit of million in  that we expect to receive in the first quarter of  following the waiver of a termination right to the lease 
we believe that our existing capital resources and interest thereon will be sufficient to fund our current and planned operations beyond however  if we change our development plans  including acquiring or developing additional product candidates or complementary businesses  we may need additional funds sooner than we expect 
we anticipate that we will incur cash outlays to conduct and support additional clinical trials both currently underway and planned for the development of carfilzomib and our other development candidates 
we also expect to incur cash outlays as we prepare for a potential commercial launch of carfilzomib  should it receive marketing approval 
further  we may be obligated to make up to an additional million of contingent earn out payments upon the achievement of regulatory approvals for carfilzomib in the us and europe  payable in either cash or common stock  at our discretion 
the terms of the development and license agreement dated november  with btg provide that we may be required to make payments to btg of up to million upon the attainment of certain global development and regulatory milestones  plus additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain marketing approvals and commercial milestones 
while most of our anticipated development costs are unknown at the current time  we may need to raise additional capital to continue the funding of our product development programs and our development plans in future periods beyond we intend to seek any required additional funding through collaborations  public and private equity or debt financings  capital lease transactions or other available financing sources 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders may result 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs or to obtain funds through collaborations with others that are on unfavorable terms or that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our cash in that we invest only in highly rated securities  diversify our portfolio of investments by limiting the exposure to any one issuer and maintain a short over all duration 
our portfolio consists of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  us government and government related securities  investment grade corporate and municipal bonds 
while we believe we take active measures to mitigate investment risk  such risks cannot be 
table of contents fully eliminated because of market circumstances particularly in the last few years 
our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
as part of our risk management procedures  we use analytical techniques including sensitivity analysis to monitor the interest rate risk in our portfolio 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  or  as of december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline or increase  respectively  by approximately million 
additionally  a hypothetical increase or decrease of in market interest rates during the year ended december  would have resulted in a change of million in our investment income for the year ended december  the table below presents the amounts and related weighted interest rates of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  maturity fair value in millions average interest rate maturity fair value in millions average interest rate cash equivalents  fixed rate months months marketable securities  fixed rate over months over months our notes  with a total par value of million at december   bear interest at a fixed rate of 
due to the fixed interest rate  we have no exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
however  underlying market risk exists related to an increase in our stock price which may make the conversion of our notes to common stock beneficial to the holders of such notes 
conversion of the notes currently would have a dilutive effect on any future earnings and book value per common share 
liquidity risk at december   our investment portfolio includes million aaa rated securities with an auction reset feature auction rate securities that are collateralized by student loans 
since february  these types of securities have experienced failures in the auction process 
however  a limited number of these securities have been redeemed at par by the issuing agencies 
as a result of the auction failures  interest rates on these securities reset at penalty rates linked to libor or treasury bill rates 
the penalty rates are generally higher than interest rates set at auction 
based on the overall failure rate of these auctions  the frequency of the failures  the underlying maturities of the securities  a portion of which are greater than years  and our belief that the market for these student loan collateralized instruments may take in excess of twelve months to fully recover  we have classified the auction rate securities with a par value of million as non current marketable securities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as december  we have determined the fair value to be million for these securities  based on a discounted cash flow model  and have reduced the carrying value of these marketable securities by million through accumulated other comprehensive income loss instead of earnings because we have deemed the impairment of these securities to be temporary 
further adverse developments in the credit market could result in an impairment charge through earnings in the future 
the discounted cash flow model used to value these securities is based on a specific term and liquidity assumptions 
an increase in either of these assumptions could result in a million decrease in value 
alternatively  a decrease in either of the assumptions could result in a million increase in value 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a majority of nexavar sales are generated outside of the united states  and a significant percentage of nexavar commercial and development expenses are incurred outside of the united states 
our revenue from collaboration agreement is dependent on these foreign currency denominated activities 
in addition  we incur research and development and general and administrative expenses outside of the united states 
as a result of these underlying non us dollar denominated activities  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars for presentation 
table of contents in our financial statements  as well as our operating margins 
the primary foreign currency that we are exposed to is the euro 
a hypothetical increase or decrease of in exchange rates between the euro versus the us dollar during the year ended december  would have resulted in a million change in our net income based on our expected exposures 
for the euro  we utilize an average exchange rate for the reporting period 
as we expand  we could be exposed to exchange rate fluctuation in other currencies 
exchange rates between foreign currencies and us dollars have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
commencing in the third quarter of  we established a foreign currency hedging program 
the objective of the program is to mitigate the foreign exchange risk arising from transactions or cash flows that have a direct or underlying exposure in non us dollar denominated currencies in order to reduce volatility in our cash flow and earnings 
currently  we hedge a certain portion of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure with options  typically no more than one year into the future 
these derivative instruments  which include derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges under asc  derivatives and hedging  are intended to reduce the effects of variations in our cash flow resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  in certain circumstances  these derivative instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss 
our cash flows are denominated in us dollars
