executive summary we are a profitable and growing specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition  development and commercialization of branded prescription products 
our primary target markets are hospital acute care and gastroenterology  which are characterized by concentrated physician bases that we believe can be penetrated effectively by relatively small  targeted sales forces 
we are dedicated to providing innovative products that improve quality of care for patients 
we operate in a single operating segment of specialty pharmaceuticals products 
our marketed product portfolio includes acetadote acetylcysteine injection for the treatment of acetaminophen poisoning  caldolor ibuprofen injection  the first injectable treatment for pain and fever approved in the united states  and kristalose lactulose for oral solution  a prescription laxative 
in early  we acquired rights to a late stage product candidate that we intend to develop under the brand name hepatoren ifetroban injection for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome 
we market and sell our approved products through our hospital and field sales forces in the united states and are working with partners to reach international markets 

table of contents the following is a summary of our highlights and recent developments 
for more information  please see part i  item i  business  of this form k 
the fda approved our snda for our new formulation of acetadote  which was the result of a phase iv commitment we made to the fda upon receipt of initial marketing approval of the product 
we filed a response with the uspto for a patent to protect our proprietary discoveries related to the new acetadote formulation 
this formulation patent was allowed and issued in china in april we also recently filed a second us patent application related to the safety profile of the new formulation 
in february  we received a notice of allowance for the composition of matter related to our new formulation of acetadote 
once issued  the patent will expire in august we implemented a pull through sales strategy for caldolor  with an emphasis on activities required to build volume and use in centers that have already stocked the product 
we acquired the rights to hepatoren  an injectable form of ifetroban for the treatment of hrs 
we continued our efforts in our clinical studies  with four studies designed to support caldolor  one study for an additional indication for kristalose and one phase ii dose escalation clinical study to evaluate hepatoren for the treatment of hrs 
we acquired the rights to certain assets of kristalose  including the kristalose trademark and fda registration 
the acquisition allows us better control of the supply chain  and allows us to pursue additional indications to increase the marketability of kristalose 
at cet  we continued to expand our collaboration partners by entering into an agreement with washington university in st 
louis to co develop promising biomedical technologies 
we continue to collaborate with vanderbilt university  the university of tennessee and the university of mississippi 
we continued to expand our international presence by entering into marketing agreements with harvest health co  ltd in taiwan and insanbakti in malaysia to market caldolor and acetadote 
in addition  al nabil international became our commercial partner of caldolor and acetadote in the uaein late in addition to the above highlights  we added key individuals to our management team 
in february  tan cheow choon was appointed director of international business 
based in singapore  choon is responsible for executing our initiative to expand our product markets across asia 
in october  we named rick s 
greene as vice president and chief financial officer 
he had previously been serving as the interim vice president of finance and accounting since april in  we evaluated our financial position and elected to pay in full our outstanding term debt balance  resulting in the elimination of interest costs associated with this debt 
we also modified our line of credit facility with bank of america to provide for up to million of available funds  with an option to increase it to million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
we reduced the cost of the loan  extended the maturity date to december and modified certain financial and restrictive covenants more favorable to us 
we continue to repurchase shares under a rule b plan that was authorized by our board of directors in may and modified in january the plan provides for the repurchase of up to million  plus the amount repurchased in  of our outstanding stock from time to time in the open market 
the timing and amount of purchases are determined by us based on evaluation of market conditions  stock price and other factors 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on past experience and on other factors we deem reasonable given the circumstances 
past results help form the basis of our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not determined from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are most critical with respect to our accounting for revenue recognition  inventory  provision for income taxes  stock based compensation  research and development accounting  and intangible assets 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
together  sab  and topic of the accounting standards codification 
our revenue is derived primarily from the product sales of acetadote  caldolor and kristalose 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is probable 
delivery is considered to have occurred upon either shipment of the product or arrival at its destination based on the shipping terms of the transaction 
when these conditions are satisfied  we recognize gross product revenue  which is the price we charge generally to our wholesalers for a particular product 
other income  which is a component of net revenues  includes rental and grant income 
other income was less than one percent of net revenues in and  and less than three percent in our net product revenue reflects the reduction of gross product revenue at the time of initial sales recognition for estimated accounts receivable allowances for chargebacks  discounts and damaged product as well as provisions for sales related accruals of rebates  product returns and administrative fees and fee for services 
our financial statements reflect accounts receivable allowances of million at december  and  and million at december   respectively  for chargebacks  discounts and allowances for product damaged in shipment 
the following table reflects our sales related accrual activity for the periods indicated below september  september  september  balance at january current provision current provision for prior period sales actual returns credits balance at december the allowances for chargebacks  discounts  and damaged products and sales related accruals for rebates and product returns are determined on a product by product basis and are established by management as our best estimate at the time of sale based on each product s historical experience  adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such allowances and accruals 
additionally  these allowances and accruals are established based on the following the contractual terms with customers  analysis of historical levels of discounts  returns  chargebacks and rebates  communications with customers  purchased information about the rate of prescriptions being written and the level of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  if known  and expectations about the market for each product  including any anticipated introduction of competitive products 
the allowances for chargebacks and accruals for rebates and product returns are the most significant estimates used in the recognition of our revenue from product sales 
of the accounts receivable allowances and our sales related accruals  our accrual for fee for services and product returns represents the majority of the balance 
sales related accrued liabilities for rebates  product returns  service fees  and administrative fees totaled million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
of these amounts  our estimated liability for fee for services represented million  million and million  respectively  while our accrual for product returns totaled million  million and million  respectively 
if the actual amount of cash discounts  chargebacks  rebates  and product returns differs from the amounts estimated by management  material differences may result from the amount of our revenue recognized from product sales 
a change in our rebate estimate of one percentage point would have impacted net sales by approximately million in each of 
table of contents the three years ended december  a change in our product return estimate of one percentage point would have impacted net sales by million for the year ended december  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
any expired product return would be from a prior period  given the shelf life of the products 
as a general rule  we do not allow customers to purchase additional product prior to a scheduled price increase 
we occasionally make an exception to this policy when we offer odd lot quantities at a slightly reduced price or when a customer opens a new facility and requests special terms on its initial purchase 
to date  we believe these types of transactions have not been material 
moreover  when we offer special terms  we review the transaction against our revenue recognition policy for proper treatment 
if we determine such transactions have become material  we will disclose the impact in the notes to our financial statements 
while we do not have regular access to our customers inventory levels  we review each order from all of our customers 
to the extent that an order reflects more than a normal purchasing pattern  management discusses the order with the customer prior to agreeing to process the order 
inventories we provide valuation reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about remaining shelf life  future demand and market conditions 
the reserve for estimated inventory obsolescence was calculated based upon specific review of the inventory expiration dates and the quantity on hand at december  in comparison to our expected inventory usage 
the amount of actual inventory obsolescence and unmarketable inventory could differ either higher or lower in the near term from the amounts accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
income taxes we provide for deferred taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
our principal differences are related to the timing of deductibility of certain items such as depreciation  amortization and expense for options issued to nonemployees 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using management s estimate of tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which management believes those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in our results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of nonqualified stock options is recognized when the benefit is used to offset income taxes payable 
as of december   we have unrecognized federal net operating loss carryforwards associated with the exercise of nonqualified options of million 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
in addition  incremental compensation expense is recognized upon the modification  cancellation or repurchase of equity awards 
the fair value of stock options and warrants are calculated using the black scholes option pricing model on the date of grant 
we estimate volatility in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
as there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering and  therefore  a lack of company specific historical or implied volatility data  we have determined the share price volatility based on an analysis of certain publicly traded companies that we consider to be our peers 
the comparable peer companies used for our estimated volatility are publicly traded companies with operations which we believe to be similar to ours 
when identifying companies as peers  we consider such characteristics as the 
table of contents type of industry  size and or type of product s  research and or product development capabilities  and stock based transactions 
we intend to continue to consistently estimate our volatility to value stock options in this manner until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of our own shares becomes available  or circumstances change such that the identified entities are no longer similar to us 
in this latter case  we would utilize other similar entities whose share prices are publicly available 
we estimate the expected life of employee share options based on the simplified method allowed by sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the average between the weighted average vesting period and the contractual term 
the expected term for options granted to nonemployees is generally the contractual term of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury note  stripped principal  on the date of grant with a term substantially equal to the corresponding option s expected term 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends nor do we plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of employee options granted during and september  september  dividend yield expected term in years expected volatility risk free interest rate the following assumptions were used in calculating the fair value of nonemployee options granted during and september  september  dividend yield expected term in years expected volatility risk free interest rate during  we began issuing restricted stock awards at no cost in lieu of stock options to employees  directors and consultants 
compensation expense for restricted stock granted to employees and directors is generally equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
if a sufficient disincentive for nonperformance does not exist at the date of grant  the compensation cost is remeasured at each reporting date at the then current fair market value of the underlying common stock until the award vests 
research and development we account for research and development costs and accrue expenses based on estimates of work performed  patient enrollment or fixed fee for services 
as work is performed and or invoices are received  we adjust our estimates and accruals 
to date  our accruals have been within our estimates 
total research and development costs are a function of studies being conducted and will increase or decrease based on the level of activity in any particular year 
intangible assets intangible assets include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in determining the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including quoted market prices  third party independent appraisals and discounted cash flow models  as considered necessary 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net product revenues 
net product revenue increased million  or  in as compared to net product revenue increased million for acetadote  which was partially offset be a decreases in kristalose revenue of million and caldolor of million 
an increase in volume of approximately and an increase in the average selling price contributed to the increase in acetadote revenue 
in early  we introduced the new formulation of acetadote that is free of ethylene diamine tetracetic acid or other stabilization and chelating agents and is preservative free 
the new formulation of acetadote has been well received in the market  and continues to be the treatment of choice for acetaminophen overdose 
additionally  acetadote revenue was positively impacted by the shortage of the oral form of n acetylcysteine due to manufacturing delays 
the shortage is expected to continue into management is unable to determine the degree to which the shortage has contributed to acetadote revenue or the impact on future revenue when the shortage problem is corrected 
the decrease in kristalose net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in volume  partially offset by an increase in the average selling price 
during  we experienced manufacturing delays caused by a change in ownership of the plant that produces kristalose 
as previously noted  we acquired the full rights to kristalose in and believe this will help alleviate some of the manufacturing delays we experienced in gross product revenue for caldolor increased million in as compared to the increase in gross revenue was primarily due to increased volume as we continue to penetrate our target market 
additionally  during the first quarter of  we initiated a shift in focus and began transitioning part of our sales and marketing resources to driving pull through use of caldolor in facilities stocking the product 
in the fourth quarter of  we notified our wholesalers that we will discontinue the mg offering of caldolor and concentrate our sales efforts on mg 
as a result  we recognized a reserve for potential returns related to the mg product  of which a majority was related to sales in prior years 
the result of this reserve plus the normal sales allowances resulted in a decrease in net product revenue of million 
other revenue 
other revenue decreased million in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the recognition of million of federal grant funding from the qualifying therapeutic discovery project  a component of the healthcare reform legislation enacted in this program was not available in cost of products sold 
cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenues increased from in to in the increase was primarily due to the recognition of million of inventory write downs during for potentially obsolete inventory 
excluding this charge  cost of products sold as a percentage of net revenues would have been 
this decrease was primarily due to the change in our sales mix in the periods 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expense totaled approximately million in  representing a decrease of million  or  over the decrease was primarily due a decrease in royalty expense as a result of the acetadote royalty agreement expiring in january and sales force and related expenses due to a reduction in headcount and savings associated with bringing the field sales force in house  rather than outsourcing 
these decreases were partially offset by increased marketing and advertising expense due to significant investments made in marketing the new formulation of acetadote and enhancing the brand message 
research and development 
research and development expense totaled million in  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase was primarily due to increased personnel costs as we expanded our research and development team and increased annual product and establishment fees from the fda for our products 
we are currently performing clinical trials on each of our products and product candidates  and expect research and development costs to increase in as these studies progress 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense totaled million in  representing an increase of million  or  over the increase was primarily due to increased charitable contributions as we donated inventory for humanitarian needs  increased travel expenses as we continue to expand our products world wide and increased consulting and personnel costs 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense totaled million in  representing a decrease of million  or  over the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the payoff of our term debt in july and lower interest rates as a result of modifying our line of credit agreement 
in august  we amended our debt agreement to provide up to million of availability under our line of credit  with the option of increasing it to million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
as a result of amending our debt agreement  we were able to reduce the interest cost through the term of the line of credit facility december  
income tax expense 
as a percentage of income before income taxes  the tax rate decreased from in to in the decrease was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income without a corresponding increase in the nature and amount of permanent differences and the effects of the therapeutic discovery tax credit in as previously noted  we received million of federal tax grants in  which represented of the eligible expenses 
the full amount of the eligible expenses was not deductible for federal income purposes 
the therapeutic discovery tax credit was not available in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for totaled approximately million  representing an increase of approximately million  or  over the same period in net revenue increased million for acetadote and decreased million and million for kristalose and caldolor  respectively 
the increase in acetadote revenue was positively impacted by a increase in volume and an increase in the average selling price  offset by an increase in fee for service deductions due to additional arrangements with our wholesalers 
while kristalose gross revenue increased  net revenue was impacted by an increase in the gross to net revenue deductions primarily associated with rebates and expired product returns 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we completed the commercial launch of caldolor  and recognized million of net revenue in our sales forces continued to maintain a consistent level of focus on acetadote and kristalose while they progressed the promotion of caldolor

research and development 
research and development expense for totaled approximately million  representing a decrease of approximately million  or  over the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in of approximately million of milestone expenses incurred upon the fda approval of caldolor in june this decrease was offset by additional costs incurred in related to annual fda product and establishment fees  increased salary and related expenses resulting from an increase in personnel and increased costs related to furthering our development efforts for our products and product candidates

based on current interest rates  we do not believe we are exposed to significant downside risk related to a change in interest on our money market accounts 
in the first quarter of  we analyzed our return on our investments and determined investing in variable rate demand notes and a portfolio of government backed securities including us treasuries  government sponsored enterprise debentures and government sponsored adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  would yield a higher return with minimal additional risk 
the variable rate demand notes  or vrdns  are generally issued by municipal governments and are backed by a financial institution letter of credit 
we hold a put right on the vrdn  which allows us to liquidate the investment relatively quickly less than one week 
the government backed securities have an active secondary market that generally provides for liquidity in less than one week 
the risk related to interest rates for these accounts will produce less income than expected if market interest rates fall 

table of contents based on current interest rates  we do not believe we are exposed to significant downside risk related to change in interest on our investment accounts 
the interest rate risk related to borrowings under our line of credit is a variable rate of libor plus an applicable margin  as defined in the loan agreement at december  
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under our line of credit 
if interest rates increased by  the impact on interest expense in future periods would be less than million 
we have sufficient cash balances to pay down the line of credit to minimize our interest rate exposure 
exchange rate risk while we operate primarily in the us  we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
a portion of our research and development is performed abroad 
as of december   our outstanding payables denominated in a foreign currency totaled less than million 
currently  we do not utilize financial instruments to hedge exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
we believe our exposure to foreign currency fluctuation is minimal as our purchases in foreign currency have a maximum exposure of days based on invoice terms with a portion of the exposure being limited to days based on the due date of the invoice 
foreign currency exchange losses were immaterial for and neither a increase nor decrease from current exchange rates would have had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
