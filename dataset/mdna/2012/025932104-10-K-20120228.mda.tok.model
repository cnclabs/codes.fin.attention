new accounting standards general following is a discussion and analysis of the financial statements and other statistical data that management believes will enhance the understanding of afg s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements beginning on page f as discussed in note a accounting policies recent accounting standards  certain historical amounts presented herein will be retrospectively restated in to reflect the adoption of new accounting guidance related to deferred policy acquisition costs dpac 
overview financial condition afg is organized as a holding company with almost all of its operations being conducted by subsidiaries 
afg  however  has continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends  and taxes 
therefore  certain analyses are best done on a parent only basis while others are best done on a total enterprise basis 
in addition  because most of its businesses are financial in nature  afg does not prepare its consolidated financial statements using a current noncurrent format 
consequently  certain traditional ratios and financial analysis tests are not meaningful 
at december   afg parent held approximately million in cash and securities and had million available under a bank line of credit expiring in august results of operations through the operations of its subsidiaries  afg is engaged primarily in property and casualty insurance  focusing on specialized commercial products for businesses and in the sale of traditional fixed and indexed annuities and a variety of supplemental insurance products such as medicare supplement 
the property and casualty business is cyclical in nature with periods of high competition resulting in low premium rates  sometimes referred to as a soft market or downcycle followed by periods of reduced competition and higher premium rates  referred to as a hard market or upcycle 
for the past several years  afg s property and casualty insurance operations have experienced soft market conditions 
afg reported net earnings attributable to shareholders of million per share diluted in compared to million per share diluted in 
table of contents improved operating results in the annuity and supplemental insurance group were more than offset by a second quarter special charge to strengthen reserves for asbestos and other environmental exposures  primarily within the property and casualty run off operations  lower underwriting profit and lower investment income in the on going property and casualty operations and a fourth quarter charge for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant effect on amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions change and thus impact amounts reported in the future 
the areas where management believes the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make accounting policies critical are as follows the establishment of insurance reserves  especially asbestos and environmental related reserves  the recoverability of reinsurance  the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs  the establishment of asbestos and environmental reserves of former railroad and manufacturing operations  and the valuation of investments  including the determination of other than temporary impairments 
see liquidity and capital resources uncertainties for a discussion of insurance reserves  recoverables from reinsurers  and contingencies related to american premier s former operations and liquidity and capital resources investments for a discussion of impairments on investments 
deferred policy acquisition costs dpac and certain liabilities related to annuities and universal life insurance products are amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies 
assumptions considered in determining expected gross profits involve significant judgment and include management s estimates of assumed interest rates and investment spreads  surrenders  annuitizations  renewal premiums and mortality 
should actual experience require management to change its assumptions commonly referred to as unlocking  a charge or credit would be recorded to adjust dpac or annuity liabilities to the levels they would have been if the new assumptions had been used from the inception date of each policy 
reserves for future policy benefits related to afg s closed block of long term care business are established and related acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the policies based on policy benefit assumptions as of the date of issuance  including investment yields  mortality  morbidity  persistency  and expenses 
once these assumptions are established for a given policy or group of policies  they are not changed over the life of the policy unless a loss recognition event premium deficiency occurs 
loss recognition occurs when  based on current expectations as of the measurement date  existing contract liabilities plus the present value of future premiums  including reasonably expected rate increases  are not expected to cover the present value of future claims payments and related settlement and maintenance costs as well as unamortized acquisition costs 
adverse changes in any of the reserve assumptions in future periods could result in loss recognition and charges to earnings for afg s long term care business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources ratios afg s debt to total capital ratio on a consolidated basis is shown below dollars in millions 
management intends to maintain the ratio of debt to capital at or below and intends to maintain the capital of its significant insurance subsidiaries at or above levels currently indicated by rating agencies as appropriate for the current ratings 
december  long term debt total capital ratio of debt to total capital including debt secured by real estate excluding debt secured by real estate the ratio of debt to total capital is a non gaap measure that management believes is useful for investors  analysts and independent ratings agencies to evaluate afg s financial strength and liquidity and to provide insight into how afg finances its operations 
it is calculated by dividing afg s long term debt by its total capital  which includes long term debt  noncontrolling interests and shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains losses related to fixed maturity investments and appropriated retained earnings related to managed investment entities 
afg s ratio of earnings to fixed charges  including annuity benefits as a fixed charge  was for the year ended december  excluding annuity benefits  this ratio was for although the ratio excluding annuity benefits is not required or encouraged to be disclosed under securities and exchange commission rules  it is presented because interest credited to annuity policyholder accounts is not always considered a borrowing cost for an insurance company 
the naic s model law for risk based capital rbc applies to both life and property and casualty companies 
rbc formulas determine the amount of capital that an insurance company needs so that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december   the capital ratios of all afg insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
parent and subsidiary liquidity parent holding company liquidity management believes afg has sufficient resources to meet its liquidity requirements 
if funds generated from operations  including dividends  tax payments and borrowings from subsidiaries  are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  afg would be required to utilize parent company cash and marketable securities or to generate cash through borrowings  sales of other assets  or similar transactions 
afg can borrow up to million under its revolving credit facility which expires in august there were no borrowings under this agreement  or any other parent company short term borrowing arrangements  during during  afg repurchased million shares of its common stock for million 
during  afg issued million of senior notes due and repurchased million shares of its common stock for million 
during  afg retired million of senior debentures at maturity  issued million of senior notes due and repurchased million shares of its common stock for million 
all debentures and notes issued by afg and aag holding company  a gafri subsidiary are rated investment grade by two nationally recognized rating agencies 
under a currently effective shelf registration statement  afg can offer additional equity or debt securities 
the shelf registration provides afg with flexibility to access the capital markets from time to time as market and other conditions permit 
under tax allocation agreements with afg  its owned us subsidiaries generally pay taxes to or recover taxes from afg based on each subsidiary s contribution to amounts due under afg s consolidated tax return 

table of contents subsidiary liquidity great american life insurance company galic  a wholly owned annuity and supplemental insurance subsidiary  is a member of the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb 
the fhlb makes advances and provides other banking services to member institutions  which provides the annuity and supplemental insurance operations with a substantial additional source of liquidity 
in the fourth quarter of  the fhlb advanced galic million at interest rates ranging from 
to 
over libor average rate of 
at december  
these advances must be repaid within to years  but galic has the option to prepay all or a portion of the advances on a monthly basis 
galic has invested the proceeds from the advances in fixed maturity securities for the purpose of earning a spread over the interest payments due to the fhlb 
national interstate corporation natl  a owned property and casualty insurance subsidiary  can borrow up to million  subject to certain conditions  under an unsecured credit agreement expiring in december amounts borrowed bear interest at rates ranging from 
to 
currently 
over libor based on natl s credit rating 
there was million outstanding under this agreement at december  the maximum outstanding balance under this agreement during was million 
the liquidity requirements of afg s insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and expenses  payments of dividends and taxes to afg and contributions of capital to their subsidiaries 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have generally provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements without requiring a sale of investments or contributions from afg 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
in addition  the insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments 
the excess cash flow of afg s property and casualty group allows it to extend the duration of its investment portfolio somewhat beyond that of its claim reserves 
in the annuity business  where profitability is largely dependent on earning a spread between invested assets and annuity liabilities  the duration of investments is generally maintained close to that of liabilities 
in a rising interest rate environment  significant protection from withdrawals exists in the form of temporary and permanent surrender charges on afg s annuity products 
with declining rates  afg receives some protection from spread compression due to the ability to lower crediting rates  subject to contractually guaranteed minimum interest rates gmirs 
afg began selling new policies with gmirs below in  almost all new business since late has been issued with a gmir 
at december   the average crediting rate on afg s annuities was approximately  while the average gmir was approximately 
this margin provides afg the flexibility to lower its crediting rates by up to basis points on average in the future should market interest rates continue to remain low for a long period of time 
for statutory accounting purposes  equity securities of non affiliates are generally carried at fair value 
at december   afg s insurance companies owned publicly traded equity securities with a fair value of million 
in addition  gai s investment in natl common stock had a fair value of million and a statutory carrying value of million at december  decreases in market prices could adversely affect the insurance group s capital  potentially impacting the amount of dividends available or necessitating a capital contribution 
conversely  increases in market prices could have a favorable impact on the group s dividend paying capability 
afg believes its insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and benefits and operating expenses 
in addition  these subsidiaries have sufficient capital to meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
nonetheless  changes in statutory accounting rules  significant declines in the fair value of the insurance subsidiaries investment portfolios or significant ratings downgrades on these investments  could create a need for additional capital 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table shows an estimate based on historical patterns and expected trends of payments to be made for insurance reserve liabilities  as well as scheduled payments for major contractual obligations in millions 
within more than total one year years years years annuity  life  accident and health liabilities a property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses b long term debt  including interest operating leases total c a reserve projections include anticipated cash benefit payments only 
projections do not include any impact for future earnings or additional premiums 
b dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
based on the same assumptions  afg projects reinsurance recoveries related to these reserves totaling billion as follows within year million  years million  years million  and thereafter million 
actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates 
c afg s million liability for unrecognized tax benefits including million in interest as of december   is not included because the period of payment cannot be reliably estimated 
afg has no material contractual purchase obligations or other long term liabilities at december  off balance sheet arrangements see note p additional information financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to the financial statements 
investments afg attempts to optimize investment income while building the value of its portfolio  placing emphasis upon total long term performance 
afg s investment portfolio at december   contained billion in fixed maturities classified as available for sale and million in equity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
in addition  million in fixed maturities were classified as trading with changes in unrealized holding gains or losses included in investment income 
as detailed under net unrealized gain on marketable securities in note e to the financial statements  unrealized gains and losses on afg s fixed maturity and equity securities are included in shareholders equity after adjustments for related changes in dpac and certain liabilities related to annuities  noncontrolling interests and deferred income taxes 
dpac applicable to annuity products is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains or losses on investments as if these gains or losses had been realized  with corresponding increases or decreases net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income in afg s balance sheet 
fixed income investment funds are generally invested in securities with intermediate term maturities with an objective of optimizing total return while allowing flexibility to react to changes in market conditions 
at december   the average life of afg s fixed maturities was about six years 
fair values for afg s portfolio are determined by afg s internal investment professionals using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non binding broker quotes 
fair values of equity securities are generally based on closing prices obtained from the pricing services 
for mortgage backed securities mbs  which comprise approximately of afg s fixed maturities  prices for each security are generally obtained from both pricing services and broker quotes 
for the remainder of afg s fixed maturity portfolio  approximately are priced using pricing services and the balance is priced primarily using non binding broker quotes 
when prices obtained for the same security vary  afg s internal investment professionals select the price they believe is most indicative of an exit price 

table of contents the pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis 
based upon information provided by the pricing services  these inputs include  but are not limited to  recent reported trades  benchmark yields  issuer spreads  bids or offers  reference data  and measures of volatility 
included in the pricing of mbs are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral 
due to the lack of transparency in the process that brokers use to develop prices  valuations that are based on brokers prices are classified as level in the gaap hierarchy unless the price can be corroborated  for example  by comparison to similar securities priced using observable inputs 
valuation techniques utilized by pricing services and prices obtained from external sources are reviewed by afg s internal investment professionals who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure the fair value determination is representative of an exit price 
to validate the appropriateness of the prices obtained  these investment managers consider widely published indices as benchmarks  recent trades  changes in interest rates  general economic conditions and the credit quality of the specific issuers 
in addition  the company communicates directly with the pricing service regarding the methods and assumptions used in pricing  including verifying  on a test basis  the inputs used by the service to value specific securities 
prices obtained from a broker or pricing service are adjusted only in cases where they are deemed not to be representative of an appropriate exit price fewer than of the securities 
in general  the fair value of afg s fixed maturity investments is inversely correlated to changes in interest rates 
the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of such fair values to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on afg s fixed maturity portfolio that an immediate increase of basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at december  dollars in millions 
increases or decreases from the basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional 
fair value of fixed maturity portfolio pretax impact on fair value of bps increase in interest rates pretax impact as of total fixed maturity portfolio approximately of the fixed maturities held by afg at december   were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies 
investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated and non investment grade 
management believes that the high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
mbs are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be repaid more rapidly than scheduled as borrowers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of lower rates 
although interest rates have been low for the last few years  a weak housing market and uncertain economic conditions have led to tighter lending standards  which have resulted in fewer buyers being able to refinance the mortgages underlying much of afg s non agency rmbs portfolio 

table of contents summarized information for afg s mbs including those classified as trading at december   is shown in millions in the table below 
agency backed securities are those issued by a us government backed agency  alt a mortgages are those with risk profiles between prime and subprime 
the majority of the alt a securities and substantially all of the subprime securities are backed by fixed rate mortgages

the naic retained a third party investment management firm to assist in the determination of appropriate naic designations for mortgage backed securities based not only on the probability of loss which is the primary basis of ratings by the major ratings firms  but also on the severity of loss and statutory carrying value 
at december   based on statutory carrying value of billion of afg s mbs securities had an naic designation of or municipal bonds represented approximately of afg s fixed maturity portfolio at december  afg s municipal bond portfolio is high quality  with of the securities rated investment grade at that date 
the portfolio is well diversified across the states of issuance and individual issuers 
at december   approximately of the municipal bond portfolio was held in revenue bonds  with the remaining held in general obligation bonds 
state general obligation securities of california  illinois  new jersey and new york collectively represented only of this portfolio

the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include a whether the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  b the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis  c historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer sec filings and news releases  d near term prospects for improvement in the issuer and or its industry  e third party research and communications with industry specialists  f financial models and forecasts  g the continuity of dividend payments  maintenance of investment grade ratings and hybrid nature of certain investments  h discussions with issuer management  and i ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value 

table of contents based on its analysis of the factors listed above  management believes i afg will recover its cost basis in the securities with unrealized losses and ii that afg has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value and had no intent to sell them at december  although afg has the ability to continue holding its investments with unrealized losses  its intent to hold them may change due to deterioration in the issuers creditworthiness  decisions to lessen exposure to a particular issuer or industry  asset liability management decisions  market movements  changes in views about appropriate asset allocation or the desire to offset taxable realized gains 
should afg s ability or intent change with regard to a particular security  a charge for impairment would likely be required 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to results of operations in future periods 
significant declines in the fair value of afg s investment portfolio could have a significant adverse effect on afg s liquidity 
for information on afg s realized gains losses on securities  including charges for other than temporary impairment  see management s discussion and analysis results of operations realized gains losses on securities 
uncertainties as more fully explained in the following paragraphs  management believes that the areas posing the greatest risk of material loss are the adequacy of its insurance reserves and contingencies arising out of its former railroad and manufacturing operations 
property and casualty insurance reserves estimating the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae is inherently judgmental and is influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation 
determining the liability is a complex process incorporating input from many areas of the company including actuarial  underwriting  pricing  claims and operations management 
the estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and for expenses of investigation and adjustment of unpaid claims are based upon a the accumulation of case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting periods on direct business written case reserves  b estimates received from ceding reinsurers and insurance pools and associations  c estimates of claims incurred but not reported or ibnr including possible development on known claims  d estimates based on experience of expense for investigating and adjusting claims  and e the current state of law and coverage litigation 
the process used to determine the total reserve for liabilities involves estimating the ultimate incurred losses and lae  adjusted for amounts already paid on the claims 
the ibnr reserve is derived by first estimating the ultimate unpaid reserve liability and subtracting case reserves and lae 
in determining management s best estimate of the ultimate liability  management including company actuaries considers items such as the effect of inflation on medical  hospitalization  material  repair and replacement costs  the nature and maturity of lines of insurance  general economic trends and the legal environment 
in addition  historical trends adjusted for changes in underwriting standards  policy provisions  product mix and other factors are analyzed using actuarial reserve development techniques 
weighing all of the factors  the management team determines a single or point estimate that it records as its best estimate of the ultimate liabilities 
ranges of loss reserves are not developed by company actuaries 
this reserve analysis and review is completed each quarter and for every line of business 
each quarterly review includes in depth analysis of over subdivisions of the business  employing multiple actuarial techniques 
for each particular subdivision  actuaries use informed  professional judgment to adjust these techniques as necessary to respond to specific conditions in the data or within the business 
some of the standard actuarial methods employed for the quarterly reserve analysis may include but may not be limited to case incurred development method paid development method projected claim count times projected claim severity bornhuetter ferguson method incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
table of contents management believes that each method has particular strengths and weaknesses and that no single estimation method is most accurate in all situations 
when applied to a particular group of claims  the relative strengths and weaknesses of each method can change over time based on the facts and circumstances 
ultimately  the estimation methods chosen are those which management believes produce the most reliable indication for the particular liabilities under review 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail 
generally  the same actuarial methods are considered for both short tail and long tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both 
the methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims 
for short tail lines  management tends to give more weight to the case incurred and paid development methods  although the various methods tend to produce similar results 
for long tail lines  more judgment is involved  and more weight may be given to the bornhuetter ferguson method and the projected claim count times projected claim severity method 
liability claims for long tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment 
therefore  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability 
the level of detail in which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
data is generally analyzed by major product or by coverage within product  using countrywide data  however  in some situations  data may be reviewed by state for a few large volume states 
appropriate segmentation of the data is determined based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business  and other actuarial considerations 
supplementary statistical information is also reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate to use or if adjustments are needed to particular methods 
such information includes open and closed claim counts average case reserves and average incurred on open claims closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages average closed claim severity ultimate claim severity reported loss ratios projected ultimate loss ratios loss payment patterns within each line  results of individual methods are reviewed  supplementary statistical information is analyzed  and all data from underwriting  operating and claim management are considered in deriving management s best estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be the result of one method  or a weighted average of several methods  or a judgmental selection as the management team determines is appropriate 

table of contents the following table shows in millions the breakdown of afg s property and casualty reserves between case reserves  ibnr reserves and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves 
gross loss reserves at december  total case ibnr lae reserve statutory line of business other liability occurrence workers compensation special property fire  allied lines  inland marine  earthquake other liability claims made commercial auto truck liability medical commercial multi peril other lines total statutory reserves adjustments for gaap reserves of foreign operations deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance loss reserve discounting other total adjustments for gaap total gaap reserves while current factors and reasonably likely changes in variable factors are considered in estimating the liability for unpaid losses  there is no method or system that can eliminate the risk of actual ultimate results differing from such estimates 
as shown in footnote a to the reserve development table loss triangle on page  the original estimates of afg s liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  over the past years have developed through december   to be deficient for three years by as much as and redundant for seven years by as much as excluding the effect of special charges for asbestos and environmental exposures 
this development illustrates the historical impact caused by variability in factors considered in estimating insurance reserves 
following is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves of the more significant long tail lines of business asbestos and environmental liabilities are separately discussed below 
many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
however  future results could vary due to an unexpected change in the underlying cost trends 
this unexpected change could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies  or other factors such as those listed below in connection with afg s largest lines of business 
it is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables  and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables 
however  it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables 
utilizing the effect of a change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than to be estimated by extrapolation 
each additional change in the cost trend would increase the effect on net earnings by an amount slightly about greater than the effect of the previous 
for example  if a change in cost trends in a line of business would change net earnings by million  a change would change net earnings by approximately million 

table of contents the estimated cumulative impact that a change in cost trends would have on net earnings is shown below in millions 
effect of change in line of business cost trends other liability occurrence workers compensation other liability claims made commercial auto truck liability medical commercial multi peril the judgments and uncertainties surrounding management s reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management s most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves have developed 
the following table shows in millions what the impact on afg s net earnings would be on the more significant lines of business if the december   reserves net of reinsurance developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years

excludes asbestos and environmental liabilities 
the following discussion describes key assumptions and important variables that affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and loss adjustment expenses of the more significant lines of business and explains what caused them to change from assumptions used in the preceding period 
other liability occurrence this long tail line of business consists of coverages protecting the insured against legal liability resulting from negligence  carelessness  or a failure to act causing property damage or personal injury to others 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability occurrence include litigious climate unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues magnitude of jury awards outside counsel costs timing of claims reporting afg recorded favorable development of million in  million in and million in related to its other liability occurrence coverage where both the frequency and severity of claims were lower than previously projected 
while management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above  more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held 
for recent accident years  more weight is given to the bornhuetter ferguson method 
uncertainty has emerged regarding afg s potential exposure for claims arising from the use of chinese drywall 
the potential exposure arises from insured policyholders who may have been associated with the installation of chinese drywall in residential construction 
afg continues to monitor judicial decisions and settlements in this evolving area and is evaluating the possible implications of recent events on its potential exposure 
while the ultimate liability is uncertain  management believes that afg s reserves for claims arising from the use of chinese drywall are adequate 

table of contents workers compensation this long tail line of business provides coverage to employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations future medical cost inflation economic conditions timing of claims reporting approximately one half of afg s workers compensation business is currently written in california 
major reforms passed by the california state legislature in and in reduced employer premiums and set treatment standards for injured workers in that state 
afg s subsidiary that writes workers compensation business in california recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in due primarily to the business written in california prior to for several years after the reforms  the impact on claim settlements was more favorable than originally anticipated for claims incurred in to  resulting in favorable development through however  this trend has subsided and the favorable development has flattened for more recent years 
in both california and countrywide  economic conditions over the last couple years have led to longer duration of claims resulting in higher claim severity 
several methods including development methods and those based on claim count and severity are weighted together to produce indications of reserve need 
management continues to review the frequency  severity and loss and lae ratios implied by the indications from the standard tests and considers the uncertainties of future costs in determining the appropriate reserve level 
other liability claims made this long tail line of business consists mostly of directors and officers liability 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for other liability claims made include litigious climate economic conditions variability of stock prices magnitude of jury awards the general state of the economy and the variability of the stock price of the insured can affect the frequency and severity of shareholder class action suits that trigger coverage under directors and officers liability policies 
recent economic conditions have led to increased claims for small account business and not for profit organizations 
afg recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in on its directors and officers liability business as claim severity was significantly less than expected for claims incurred prior to claims incurred in have developed adversely as economic conditions have driven severity higher than originally anticipated 
the legal professional liability business  which has been in run off since  had favorable development of million in  million in and million in after several years of modest adverse development  as this run off liability has matured  the claim severity trends have stabilized 
while management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above  more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held 
the selection of methods vary by subdivision of the data within this line 
some businesses within this line use the paid development method while others use the case incurred development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method 

table of contents commercial auto truck liability medical this line of business is a mix of coverage protecting the insured against legal liability for property damage or personal injury to others arising from the operation of commercial motor vehicles 
the property damage liability exposure is usually short tail with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims 
the bodily injury and medical payments exposures are longer tailed  although the claim reporting is relatively quick  the final settlement can take longer to achieve 
some of the important variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto truck liability medical are similar to other liability occurrence and include magnitude of jury awards unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues litigious climate and trends change in frequency of severe accidents health care costs and utilization of medical services by injured parties afg recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in for this line of business as claim severity was lower than in prior assumptions 
commercial multi peril this long tail line of business consists of two or more coverages protecting the insured from various property and liability risk exposures 
the commercial multi peril line of business includes coverage similar to other liability occurrence  so in general  variables affecting estimation of loss reserves for commercial multi peril include those mentioned above for other liability occurrence 
in addition  this line includes reserves for a run off book of homebuilders business covering contractors liability for construction defects 
variables important to estimating the liabilities for this coverage include changing legal regulatory interpretations of coverage statutes of limitations and statutes of repose in filing claims changes in policy forms and endorsements afg recorded adverse prior year loss development of million in and million in after having favorable development of million in the adverse development resulted from higher claim frequency and severity in a block of program business related to motel hotel  apartments  restaurants  taverns and recreation 
this adverse development more than offset favorable development in coverage for non profit organizations of million in  million in and million in as claim severity was less than anticipated 
reserves of foreign operations reserves of foreign operations relate primarily to the operations of marketform group  limited  afg s owned united kingdom based lloyd s insurer 
historically  the largest line of business written by marketform has been non us medical malpractice  which provides coverage for injuries and damages caused by medical care providers  including but not limited to  hospitals and their physicians 
although marketform offers this product in approximately countries  the majority of the business has been written in the united kingdom  australia and italy 
significant variables in estimating the loss reserves for the medical malpractice business include litigious environment magnitude of court awards a slow moving judicial system including varying approaches to medical malpractice claims among courts in different regions of italy third party claims administration in italy trends in claim costs  including medical cost inflation and  in italy  escalating tables used to establish damages for personal injury 
table of contents marketform recorded adverse prior year reserve development of million in  million in and million in related primarily to its italian public hospital medical malpractice business  which it ceased writing in the development resulted from significant issues related to third party administration of claims and a challenging legal environment in italy 
management believes that current reserves  which represent its best estimate of future liabilities  are adequate 
nonetheless  it concluded that sufficient uncertainty exists with respect to italian public hospital medical malpractice reserves to leave open the year of account  in accordance with lloyd s provisions until a larger percentage of claims have been paid and the ultimate liabilities can be estimated with greater certainty 
included in afg s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december   are reserves of million related to this business 
traditional actuarial techniques are not applicable to the italian public hospital medical malpractice business due to the significant changes in this account over time 
accordingly  more detailed methods are used  including claim count development times average severity  and uplifting case reserves to historical severity levels 
recoverables from reinsurers and availability of reinsurance afg is subject to credit risk with respect to its reinsurers  as reinsurance contracts do not relieve afg of its liability to policyholders 
to mitigate this risk  substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade or better s p ratings or is secured by funds withheld or other collateral 
the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions  which are beyond afg s control and which may affect afg s level of business and profitability 
although the cost of certain reinsurance programs may increase  management believes that afg will be able to maintain adequate reinsurance coverage at acceptable rates without a material adverse effect on afg s results of operations 
afg s gross and net combined ratios are shown in the table below 
see item business property and casualty operations reinsurance for more information on afg s reinsurance programs 
for additional information on the effect of reinsurance on afg s historical results of operations see note o insurance reinsurance and the gross loss development table under item business property and casualty operations loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the following table illustrates the effect that purchasing reinsurance has had on afg s combined ratio over the last three years 
before reinsurance gross effect of reinsurance actual net of reinsurance asbestos and environmental related a e insurance reserves asbestos and environmental reserves of the property and casualty group consisted of the following in millions december  asbestos environmental a e reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable reinsurance recoverable  net of allowance gross a e reserves asbestos reserves include claims asserting alleged injuries and damages from exposure to asbestos 
environmental reserves include claims relating to polluted waste sites 

table of contents asbestos claims against manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were presented under the products liability section of their policies which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s liability 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of their policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits  creating potentially greater exposure for insurers 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
afg  along with other insurers  is and will be subject to such non products claims 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether afg and other insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
therefore  the future impact of such efforts is uncertain 
approximately of afg s net asbestos reserves relate to policies written directly by afg subsidiaries 
claims from these policies generally are product oriented claims with only a limited amount of non product exposures  and are dominated by small to mid sized commercial entities that are mostly regional policyholders with few national target defendants 
the remainder is assumed reinsurance business that includes exposures for the periods to the asbestos and environmental assumed claims are ceded by various insurance companies under reinsurance treaties 
a majority of the individual assumed claims have exposures of less than  to afg 
asbestos losses assumed include some of the industry known manufacturers  distributors and installers 
pollution losses include industry known insured names and sites 
establishing reserves for a e claims relating to policies and participations in reinsurance treaties and former operations is subject to uncertainties that are significantly greater than those presented by other types of claims 
for this group of claims  traditional actuarial techniques that rely on historical loss development trends cannot be used and a range of reasonably possible losses cannot be estimated 
case reserves and expense reserves are established by the claims department as specific policies are identified 
in addition to the case reserves established for known claims  management establishes additional reserves for claims not yet known or reported and for possible development on known claims 
these additional reserves are management s best estimate based on periodic comprehensive studies and internal reviews adjusted for payments and identifiable changes  supplemented by management s review of industry information about such claims  with due consideration to individual claim situations 
management believes that estimating the ultimate liability for asbestos claims presents a unique and difficult challenge to the insurance industry due to  among other things  inconsistent court decisions  an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos related liabilities  novel theories of coverage  and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage 
the casualty insurance industry is engaged in extensive litigation over these coverage and liability issues as the volume and severity of claims against asbestos defendants continue to increase 
environmental claims likewise present challenges in prediction  due to uncertainty regarding the interpretation of insurance policies  complexities regarding multi party involvements at sites  evolving clean up standards and protracted time periods required to assess the level of clean up required at contaminated sites 
emerging trends  such as those named below  could impact afg s reserves and payments there is a growing interest at the state level to attempt to legislatively address asbestos liabilities and the manner in which asbestos claims are resolved 
these developments are fluid and could result in piecemeal state by state solutions 
the manner by which bankruptcy courts are addressing asbestos liabilities is in flux 
afg s insureds may make claims alleging significant non products exposures 

table of contents while management believes that afg s reserves for a e claims are a reasonable estimate of ultimate liability for such claims  actual results may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded due to the difficulty in predicting the number of future claims  the impact of recent bankruptcy filings  and unresolved issues such as whether coverage exists  whether policies are subject to aggregate limits on coverage  how claims are to be allocated among triggered policies and implicated years  and whether claimants who exhibit no signs of illness will be successful in pursuing their claims 
a variation in loss cost trends  caused by any of the factors previously described  would change net income by approximately million 
afg tracks its a e claims by policyholder 
the following table shows  by type of claim  the number of policyholders that did not receive any payments in the calendar year separate from policyholders that did receive a payment 
policyholder counts represent policies written by afg subsidiaries and do not include assumed reinsurance 
number of policyholders with no payments asbestos environmental number of policyholders with payments asbestos environmental total amounts paid net of amounts received from reinsurers for asbestos and environmental claims  including loss adjustment expenses  were as follows in millions asbestos environmental total the survival ratio is a measure often used by industry analysts to compare a e reserves strength among companies 
this ratio is typically calculated by dividing reserves for a e exposures by the three year average of paid losses  and therefore measures the number of years that it would take to pay off current reserves based on recent average payments 
because this ratio can be significantly impacted by a number of factors such as loss payout variability  caution should be exercised in attempting to determine reserve adequacy based simply on the survival ratio 
at december   afg s three year survival ratios were times paid losses for the asbestos reserves and times paid losses for the total a e reserves 
excluding amounts associated with the settlements of asbestos related coverage litigation for ap green industries see item legal proceedings and another large claim  afg s three year survival ratios were and times paid losses for the asbestos reserves and total a e reserves  respectively 
data published by conning research consulting in june indicate that industry survival ratios were for asbestos reserves and for total a e reserves at december  afg has conducted comprehensive studies of its asbestos and environmental reserves with the aid of outside actuarial and engineering firms and specialty outside counsel every two years with an in depth internal review during the intervening years 
in the second quarter of  afg completed a comprehensive study of its asbestos and environmental exposures relating to the run off operations of its property and casualty group and its exposures related to former railroad and manufacturing operations and sites 
the study relied on a ground up exposure analysis 
with respect to asbestos  it considered products and non products exposures  paid claims history  the pattern of new claims  settlements and projected development 
as a result of the study  afg recorded a million special charge net of reinsurance to increase the property and casualty group s asbestos reserves by million and its environmental reserves by million 
the property and casualty group s asbestos reserves increase related primarily to exposures on business assumed from other insurers resulting from an increase in anticipated aggregate exposures in several large settlements involving several insurers in which afg has a small proportional share 
some insurers have settled long standing asbestos exposures with their insureds and are seeking payment from reinsurers 
asbestos reserves related to the property and casualty group s direct 
table of contents asbestos exposures were increased to reflect higher frequency and severity of mesothelioma and other cancer claims as well as increased defense costs on many of these claims 
these trends were partially offset by a decline in the number of claims without serious injury and fewer new claims that required payment being reported to afg 
the increase in the property and casualty group s environmental reserves was attributed primarily to a small number of increases on specific environmental claims at several sites 
during the second quarter of  an in depth internal review of afg s a e exposures was completed by afg s internal a e claims specialists and actuaries in consultation with external actuaries and specialty outside counsel 
during the second quarter of  afg completed a comprehensive study of its a e exposures with the assistance of outside actuarial and engineering firms and specialty outside counsel 
the in depth internal review and the comprehensive study resulted in only minor adjustments to the a e reserves 
see management s discussion and analysis results of operations asbestos and environmental reserve charges for the amount of a e reserve strengthening recorded in  and supplemental insurance reserves long term care afg  as well as other companies selling long term care products have relatively limited claims  lapse  and mortality experience over extended periods  making it difficult to predict future claims 
long term care claims tend to be much higher in dollar amount and longer in duration than other health care products such as medicare supplement 
in addition  long term care claims are incurred much later in the life of a policy than most other supplemental health products 
these factors make it difficult to appropriately price this product and were instrumental in afg s decision to stop writing new policies beginning in january afg s long term care products have level premiums and are guaranteed renewable 
premium rates can potentially be increased in reaction to adverse experience 
however  any rate increases would require regulatory approval 
reserves for future policy benefits under long term care policies are established and related acquisition costs are amortized over the life of the policies based on policy benefit assumptions as of the date of issuance  including investment yields  mortality  morbidity  persistency  and expenses 
once these assumptions are established for a given policy or group of policies  they are not changed over the life of the policy unless a loss recognition event premium deficiency occurs 
loss recognition occurs when  based on current expectations as of the measurement date  existing contract liabilities plus the present value of future premiums  including reasonably expected rate increases  are not expected to cover the present value of future claims payments and related settlement and maintenance costs as well as unamortized acquisition costs 
based on loss recognition testing at december   afg s long term care reserves plus the present value of future premiums exceeded claims costs and unamortized acquisition expenses by approximately million 
adverse changes in any of the reserve assumptions in future periods could result in loss recognition for afg s long term care business 
for example  a change in claims costs or a change in investment yields in all future periods  excluding their effect on the company s ability to achieve future rate increases  would each impact the december   excess described above by approximately million 
once the excess is reduced to zero  the impact of adverse changes in assumptions is recorded as a charge to earnings as either a reduction in unamortized acquisition costs or an increase to contract reserves  net of any reinsurance recoverable 
contingencies related to subsidiaries former operations the a e studies and reviews discussed above encompassed reserves for various environmental and occupational injury and disease claims and other contingencies arising out of the railroad operations disposed of by american premier s predecessor and certain manufacturing operations disposed of by american premier and its subsidiaries and by gafri 
charges resulting from the a e studies and review were less than million in  and liabilities for claims and contingencies arising from these former operations totaled million at december  for a discussion of the uncertainties in determining the ultimate liability  see note m contingencies to the financial statements

net earnings attributable to shareholders and core net earnings decreased in compared to due primarily to lower underwriting profit and lower investment income in the property and casualty insurance operations partially offset by increased earnings in the annuity and supplemental operations 
net earnings attributable to shareholders were also impacted by a second quarter special a e charge and a fourth quarter charge for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
net earnings attributable to shareholders and core net operating earnings decreased in compared to due primarily to lower underwriting profit and lower investment income in the property and casualty insurance operations  partially offset by improved results in the annuity and supplemental insurance operations 
net earnings attributable to shareholders also benefited from higher realized gains in than in property and casualty insurance underwriting afg reports its property and casualty insurance business in the following sub segments i property and transportation  ii specialty casualty and iii specialty financial 
to understand the overall profitability of particular lines  the timing of claims payments and the related impact of investment income must be considered 
certain short tail lines of business primarily property coverages generally have quick loss payouts  which reduce the time funds are held  thereby limiting investment income earned thereon 
on the other hand  long tail lines of business primarily liability coverages and workers compensation generally have payouts that are either structured over many years or take many years to settle  thereby significantly increasing investment income earned on related premiums received 
underwriting profitability is measured by the combined ratio  which is a sum of the ratios of losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends to premiums 
a combined ratio under indicates an underwriting profit 
the combined ratio does not reflect investment income  other income or federal income taxes 

table of contents while afg desires and seeks to earn an underwriting profit on all of its business  it is not always possible to do so 
as a result  afg attempts to expand in the most profitable areas and control growth or even reduce its involvement in the least profitable ones 
afg s combined ratio has been better than the industry average for twenty four of the last twenty six years 
management believes that afg s insurance operations have performed better than the industry as a result of its specialty niche focus  product line diversification  stringent underwriting discipline and alignment of compensation incentives

table of contents annuity benefits annuity benefits reflect amounts accrued on annuity policyholders funds accumulated 
on deferred annuities annuities in the accumulation phase  interest is generally credited to policyholders accounts at their current stated interest rates 
furthermore  for two tier deferred annuities annuities under which a higher interest amount can be earned if a policy is annuitized rather than surrendered  additional reserves are accrued for i persistency and premium bonuses and ii excess benefits expected to be paid for future deaths and annuitizations 
changes in investment yields  crediting rates  actual surrender  death and annuitization experience or modifications in actuarial assumptions can affect these additional reserves and could result in charges or credits to earnings in the period the projections are modified

the portfolios of afg s insurance operations are managed with an attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
afg s annuity and run off life operations attempt to align the duration of their invested assets to the projected cash flows of policyholder liabilities 
consistent with the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis investments  the following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the fair value of afg s fixed maturity portfolio to reasonably likely changes in interest rates by illustrating the estimated effect on afg s fixed maturity portfolio that an immediate increase of basis points in the interest rate yield curve would have at december based on the duration of the portfolio  dollars in millions 
increases or decreases from the basis points illustrated would be approximately proportional 
fair value of fixed maturity portfolio pretax impact on fair value of bps increase in interest rates pretax impact as of total fixed maturity portfolio 
table of contents european debt exposure certain european countries  including the so called peripheral countries greece  portugal  ireland  italy and spain have been experiencing varying degrees of financial stress over the past couple of years 
there remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments in the european debt crisis and the impact on global financial markets 
market concerns over the direct and indirect exposure of european financial institutions to the peripheral countries have resulted in widening of credit spreads and increased costs of funding for some european financial institutions 
at december   afg owned no sovereign debt issued by the peripheral countries

in late  afg began issuing products with guaranteed minimum crediting rates of less than in states where required approvals have been received 
the guaranteed minimum crediting rate on virtually all new product sales since is 
at december   approximately half of afg s annuity contracts were at  or within ten basis points of the guaranteed minimum crediting rate 
at december   the weighted average stated crediting rate on the in force block of afg s principal fixed annuity products was approximately  and management estimates that the crediting rate on this in force business will remain approximately over the next five years 
this rate reflects actuarial assumptions as to i expected investment spreads  ii deaths  iii annuitizations  iv surrenders and v renewal premiums 
actual experience and changes in actuarial assumptions may result in different effective crediting rates than those above 
the current stated crediting rates excluding bonus interest on new sales of afg s fixed annuity products generally range from to 
actuarial assumptions used to estimate dpac and certain annuity liabilities  as well as afg s ability to maintain spread  could be impacted if a low interest rate environment continues for an extended period  or if increases in interest rates cause policyholder behavior to differ significantly from current expectations

afg s indexed annuities represented approximately one third of annuity benefits accumulated at december  these annuities provide policyholders with a crediting rate tied  in part  to the performance of an existing stock market index 
afg attempts to mitigate the risk in the index based component of these products through the purchase of call options on the appropriate index 
afg s strategy is designed so that an increase in the liabilities  due to an increase in the market index  will be generally offset by unrealized and realized gains on the call options purchased by afg 
both the index based component of the annuities and the related call options are considered derivatives and adjusted to fair value through current earnings as annuity benefits 
adjusting these derivatives to fair value increased decreased annuity benefits expense by million in  million in and million in long term debt the following table shows scheduled principal payments in millions on fixed rate long term debt of afg and its subsidiaries and related weighted average interest rates for each of the subsequent five years and for all years thereafter
