corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system 
our products are sold in more than countries and are used to treat arterial blockages in the heart and legs and to remove pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads 
approximately of our disposable product revenue is from products used in connection with our proprietary excimer laser system  the cvx 
our single use laser catheters contain up to small diameter  flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
we believe that our excimer laser system is the only laser system approved in the united states  europe  japan and canada for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures

table of contents financial results by geographical segment our two reporting segments consist of united states medical  which includes the united states and canada  and international medical  which includes europe  the middle east  asia pacific  latin america and puerto rico 
united states medical also includes all costs for our corporate headquarters  research and development  and corporate administrative functions 
the international medical segment is engaged primarily in distribution activities  with no local manufacturing or product development functions 
for the years ended december   and  a portion of research and development and general and administrative costs incurred in the us has been allocated to international medical based on a percentage of revenue  because these costs support our ability to generate revenue in the international segment

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared with million for the year ended december  of the million revenue increase  approximately was in disposables product revenue and was in laser and service revenue 
this resulted in a slight change in our product mix year over year  with disposables products generating of revenue in compared with in service and other revenue remained stable at of total revenue in both years 
revenue from laser equipment sales and rentals increased to of total revenue in compared with in vascular intervention vi disposables revenue  which includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular systems  increased in compared with vi sales include three product categories atherectomy  which increased  crossing solutions  which were flat year over year  and thrombectomy  which decreased  all compared with the increase in atherectomy revenue was due to increased unit volumes of peripheral and coronary atherectomy products 
increased peripheral atherectomy product sales were primarily related to higher sales to stand alone physician clinics  which provide increased access for patients at a potentially lower cost to the healthcare system 
increased coronary atherectomy product sales were due primarily to increased use of our products within existing accounts 
crossing solutions product sales were flat year over year  in spite of increased competition 
the decline in thrombectomy revenue was primarily due to a reduction in sales of the thromcat xt catheter in europe  due to a greater focus on products with higher sales volumes 
lead management lm revenue grew in as compared with we believe our lm revenue continues to increase primarily as a result of clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of removing pacemaker and defibrillator leads  including results from the four year lead extraction in contemporary settings lexicon study published in the february  issue of the journal of the american college of cardiology  expanded guidelines for lead extractions set forth by the heart rhythm society  an expanding market for lead extractions due primarily to increasing infection rates and an increase in the number of malfunctioning leads  and our customer focused lm sales organization 
lm revenue increased significantly in japan  where recent reimbursement approvals have allowed us to make available our complete lead management system 
laser equipment revenue increased to million in from million in equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  increased from we sold laser systems sales from inventory and sale conversions from rental units in compared with in rental revenue decreased in as compared with the prior year  with increased revenue from straight rentals offset by a decrease in cap free fee per procedure revenue 
service and other revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during the prior year 
of those new laser placements  laser systems were transfers from the existing installed base in compared with transfers in of the laser placements  of the new placements were with office based physicians  primarily transfers of underperforming laser systems from hospital environments 
reimbursement changes made in late for procedures conducted in an office setting enabled us to place lasers with these office based physicians 
in recent quarters  we have placed more focus on redeploying laser systems from hospitals with low laser based catheter utilization to hospitals or offices where we believe utilization will be higher  in order to increase productivity per laser system 
the new placements brought our worldwide installed base of laser systems to  in the us at december  on a geographic basis  revenue in the united states was million in  an increase of from the prior year 
international revenue was million  an increase of from the increase in international revenue was due to increases in both vi and lm disposables and laser equipment revenue 
we recorded nine international laser system sales in compared with six laser system sales in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates also contributed million to the revenue increase compared with 
table of contents gross margin in was compared with in the increase was due to a combination of changes in product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
our revenue increase in included a higher percentage of laser disposables  which carry higher gross margins than non laser catheters  as compared with the prior year 
margins can fluctuate based on a number of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies and product mix 
operating expenses operating expenses were million in  a decrease of from million in operating expenses represented of total revenue in as compared with of total revenue in operating expenses in and included a number of special items which are separately disclosed components within operating expenses in our statement of operations 
in  these special items totaled million  compared with million in  and they are further described below 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased compared with the year ago period 
as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses decreased to of revenue in compared with in within sg a  marketing and selling expenses increased million  or  year over year  due primarily to the following a million increase in vi and lm marketing expense  due to new hires and increased marketing and training events  a million increase in international sales expense due in part to new hires  increased performance based incentive compensation and a million impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
also within sg a  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  year over year  with increases in company wide performance based incentive compensation expense partially offset by a decrease in outside consulting costs associated with regulatory compliance 
research  development and other technology 
research  development and other technology expenses were approximately million in  an increase of from million in as a percentage of revenue  research  development and other technology costs increased to of revenue in from of revenue in  due to our investments primarily in new product development projects and the excite isr clinical trial 
costs included in research  development and other technology expenses are product development costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
fluctuations in these costs were as follows product development and related regulatory costs increased approximately million compared with due to an increase in headcount and in materials expenses related to new product development projects 
clinical studies expense increased by approximately million due primarily to costs associated with the excite isr clinical trial 
royalty expenses increased by approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
federal investigation legal and accrued indemnification costs 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge to accrue the low end of our estimate of the range of our contingent liability for indemnification 
table of contents obligations we have to three former employees who were indicted on charges related to a federal investigation 
in addition  in  we had million of legal costs associated with the federal investigation 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reduction in our accrual for indemnification costs to reflect a change in our estimate 
the decrease in our estimate is the result of the following recent developments 
in february  we entered into certain agreements with the two former employees who were to be tried later in the month 
these agreements gave us increased clarity as to the likely amount of expenses to be incurred through the conclusion of the trials 
thereafter  in february  a trial was held for two of the defendants  which resulted in the acquittal of one defendant on all charges and acquittal of the other defendant on all charges except for one count of making false statements to federal investigators 
on march   the us district court of colorado dismissed the charges against the third defendant who had previously been granted a separate trial 
as a result of the agreements with the former employees  their subsequent jury verdicts and the dismissal of charges against the third defendant  we now believe that our estimate of the remaining legal fees and expenses as of december  can be reasonably determined 
we now estimate that our total costs in these matters will total approximately million as compared with the original million estimate 
the million adjustment to our accrual reduces the remaining liability as of december  to approximately million  which is expected be paid by june  the actual expenses may be higher or lower than the estimate depending upon final resolution of the proceedings 
factors that may cause us to increase the accrual include but are not limited to the success or failure of an appeal  and in particular  a successful appeal that results in the order of a new trial 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report for further discussion of this matter 
settlement costs license agreement dispute 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the termination of a license agreement because the underlying cause of the dispute and likelihood of a settlement to resolve such dispute existed as of december  in january  we terminated a license agreement  dated february  with medtronic  inc in  the parties disputed whether royalties were owed under the license agreement 
under the termination agreement  we paid to medtronic million in january in settlement of all obligations under the license agreement  and neither party has any further rights or obligations under the license agreement 
we had accrued royalty expenses in the amount of million prior to the termination settlement  therefore  we recorded the million charge as settlement costs license agreement dispute in our financial statements for the quarter ended december  royalty expenses paid or accrued under the license agreement for the year ended december  were approximately million 
royalty expenses will not be incurred subsequent to the effective date of the termination agreement 
see note  settlement costs license agreement dispute  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of this matter 
litigation charge 
we have been engaged in a dispute since with cardiomedica spa  an italian company  over the existence of a distribution agreement between cardiomedica and us 
in september  the dutch court of appeal issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay to cardiomedica million in damages plus million in interest  which represented an additional award to the million granted to cardiomedica by the court in  but which cardiomedica had appealed 
we paid and expensed the additional award in september see note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of this matter 
employee termination costs 
in the third quarter of  we terminated employees  primarily within the vascular intervention sales organization  as a result of a strategic re alignment of certain sales territories designed to improve sales productivity 
as a result  we recorded severance obligations totaling million in the third quarter of effective november   emile geisenheimer retired from his positions as chairman  president  and chief executive officer 
in connection with his retirement and release of claims  we paid 
table of contents mr 
geisenheimer million  equal to one year s salary  which was the amount payable under his employment agreement in connection with termination of his employment 
in addition  outstanding stock options held by mr 
geisenheimer to purchase  shares of our common stock became fully vested in accordance with their terms  resulting in non cash stock compensation expense of million 
these amounts  along with certain health insurance premiums  were recorded in the three months ended december  asset impairment charge 
in the third quarter of  we wrote off a capital project in process that was no longer expected to be completed and used  due to an epa ruling that effectively limited the useful life of the asset 
interest income expense litigation related interest expense 
as discussed above  in september  the dutch court of appeal issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay to cardiomedica million for lost profits plus million in interest 
we paid and expensed this amount in september interest income  net 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income in was due primarily to a lower investment portfolio balance 
income loss before income taxes pre tax income for the year ended december  was million  compared with a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  the current year results included million of special items  and the prior year results included million of special items  as described above 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of million in this was primarily the result of taxes currently payable in state and foreign jurisdictions as well as deferred tax expense arising from net deferred tax liabilities after consideration of the substantial valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
income tax expense in included approximately million of income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and million of state income taxes currently payable for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded deferred federal and state tax expense of million representing a deferred tax liability related to the difference in accounting for our goodwill  which is amortized over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes in accordance with us gaap 
the remainder of our tax nols in the netherlands expired unutilized at the end of however  prior to expiration we entered into a strategic tax transaction with the approval of the dutch tax authority which allowed spectranetics international b 
v bv to sell its assets including goodwill to a newly created subsidiary of bv 
the transaction allowed bv to offset the gain from the sale of the assets with a portion of its nol prior to expiration 
the new subsidiary will be allowed to amortize the tax basis goodwill over ten years for tax purposes 
we therefore recorded a million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of representing our estimate of the actual utilization of the extended tax deduction in future years 
in  we increased our valuation allowance against our us deferred tax asset to 
the effect of the valuation allowance adjustment was to increase our provision for income taxes by million for the year ended december  events in  primarily the third quarter indictment of former employees  the related million accrual for indemnification costs for these employees  and the possibility that such costs could exceed the estimated accrual  caused us to conclude that we no longer met the accounting criteria for recognizing a portion of our deferred tax asset 
income tax expense also included approximately  comprised of state and foreign income taxes payable for the year ended december  
table of contents we continue to believe there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the realization of our us deferred tax assets through future taxable income 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
in the event there is a change in circumstances in the future which would affect the utilization of our deferred tax assets  the tax provision in that period would be adjusted by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable 
see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report for further discussion of our income tax provision 
net income loss we recorded net income for the year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  functional currency the functional currency of spectranetics international bv  spectranetics deutschland gmbh and spectranetics austria gmbh is the euro 
all revenue and expenses are translated to us dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighted average exchange rates during the year 
fluctuations in currency rates during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  caused an increase in consolidated revenue of approximately million and an increase in consolidated net income of approximately million

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to increased lm disposables revenue and increased equipment rental revenue  offset by a decline in vi disposables revenue compared with the prior year 
our product mix remained stable year over year  with disposable products generating of revenue  service and other revenue generating and revenue from laser sales and rentals at of total revenue in both years 
vi revenue decreased from to vi sales include three product categories atherectomy  which decreased  crossing solutions  which decreased  and thrombectomy  which decreased  all compared with the decline in atherectomy revenue was due primarily to a decrease in sales of our turbo elite products  as a result of a challenging economic environment  disruption associated with the elimination and realignment of certain sales territories in the second half of and ongoing competitive product pressures 
these declines were partially offset by sales of our turbo tandem product  which was launched in march and generated revenue of million in we believe the decrease in crossing solutions product sales is primarily due to the competitive environment  with the introduction by competitors of alternative crossing solutions products in late we believe the decline in thrombectomy revenue was partially due to ordering patterns adversely impacted as a result of the quickcat recall announced in july lm revenue grew in as compared with we believe our lm revenue is increasing primarily as a result of clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of removing pacemaker and defibrillator leads  expanded guidelines for lead extractions set forth by the heart rhythm society  an expanding market for lead extractions due primarily to increasing infection rates and an increase in the number of malfunctioning leads  and our customer focused lm sales organization 
laser equipment revenue increased to million in from million in rental revenue increased in as compared with this increase was due primarily to the increase in our installed rental base of laser systems  which increased to at december  from at december   and our conversion of under performing cap free fee per procedure lasers to straight rentals 
equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  decreased from we sold laser systems in each of and  however  our average sales price of laser systems decreased slightly in compared with primarily due to a change in the mix of new and remanufactured systems sales 
service and other revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during of those new laser placements  laser systems were transfers from the existing installed base in compared with transfers in in the past two years  we have placed more focus on redeploying laser systems from hospitals with low laser based catheter utilization to hospitals where we believe utilization will be higher  in order to increase productivity per laser system 
both our focus on redeploying laser systems and our emphasis on increasing sales to existing accounts resulted in fewer net new placements in as compared with  which we anticipated 
our worldwide installed base of laser systems was in the us at december  on a geographic basis  revenue in the united states was million in  an increase of from international revenue totaled million in  a decrease of from  due in part to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
gross margin in and was 
gross margin was favorably impacted by the year over year change in product mix  as the revenue increase was primarily in higher margin disposable products 
laser margins in were also slightly higher than laser margins in  due primarily to an increase in straight rentals and a decrease in cap free fee per procedure programs 
however  these improvements in gross margin were offset by 
table of contents the impact of the voluntary product recall and related expenses for product replacement of the quickcat catheter 
cost of products sold included a million charge related to the recall  of which million was related to the costs associated with the return and replacement of product and million was related to the disposal and write off of inventory

research  development and other technology 
research  development and other technology expenses of approximately million in decreased compared with  and in and represented of revenue 
fluctuations in these costs resulted from the following product development and related regulatory costs increased approximately million compared with primarily related to an increase in outside consulting costs to support our regulatory affairs activities 
clinical studies expense decreased by approximately million due to the conclusion of several studies that were ongoing in royalty expenses increased by approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
federal investigation legal and accrued indemnification costs 
in the third quarter of  three former employees with whom we have indemnification obligations were indicted on charges related to a federal investigation  which significantly increased the likelihood that the former employees future defense costs would be substantial and ongoing  and that our indemnification obligations to these employees would exceed the limits of our insurance coverage 
therefore  at september   we recorded a million charge to accrue the low end of our estimate of the range of our contingent liability under the indemnification obligations 
we estimated that the legal fees in this matter for the us district court of colorado stage of these proceedings could range from million to million through trial and that these costs would be paid over the course of the court proceedings 
we developed the estimate with the assistance of outside legal counsel familiar with court proceedings similar in nature to the proceedings related to our indemnification obligations 
in addition  we incurred 
table of contents approximately million of legal costs related to the conclusion of the federal investigation in we subsequently decreased our estimated accrual by million in the fourth quarter of legal and other expenses related to the federal investigation were approximately million in federal investigation settlement

geisenheimer s retirement and release of claims  we paid mr 
geisenheimer million  equal to one year s salary  which was the amount payable under his employment agreement in connection with termination of his employment 
in addition  outstanding stock options held by mr 
geisenheimer to purchase  shares of our common stock became fully vested in accordance with their terms  resulting in non cash stock compensation expense of million 
these amounts  along with certain health insurance premiums  were recorded in the three months ended december  in the second and third quarters of  we eliminated certain positions to streamline operations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and we held no investment securities 
this represented an increase of million from million at december   which included million of auction rate securities ars that we liquidated in the first quarter of at to of par 
during the first half of  we expect several significant uses of cash  two of which have already occurred 
first  in january we paid million to medtronic  inc in settlement of all obligations under a terminated license agreement 
see further discussion of this matter in note  settlement costs license agreement dispute  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
second  in february  we made a cumulative sales milestone payment of million to kensey nash corporation knc 
the milestone payment was payable when cumulative sales of the products we acquired from them in reached million 
we achieved the milestone in the fourth quarter of in march  we entered into a termination  settlement agreement and mutual release with knc 
under this agreement  a final payment of million will be made in connection with knc s product development efforts and no further milestone or other payment obligations will be due 
see further discussion of the termination agreement and these payments in note  agreements with kensey nash corporation  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
third  we currently expect to pay a substantial portion of our accrued indemnification obligations to former employees in the first and second quarters of  subject to the uncertainties inherent in our estimates 
the indemnification payments will reduce the million accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet at december  see further discussion of these costs in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  anticipated funds from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  additional funding may be needed or sought prior to such time 
in the event that we require additional working capital to fund future operations and any future acquisitions  we may access available borrowings under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank described below 
we may also enter into credit and financing arrangements with one or more independent institutional lenders  sell shares of our common stock or other equity securities  or sell debt securities 
a financing transaction may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and a financing transaction may be dilutive to our current stockholders 
operating activities

non cash expenses included million of depreciation and amortization  million of stock based compensation  million of provision for excess and obsolete inventories  and a net change in deferred taxes of million 
cash used as a result of a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million was due primarily to the following an increase in equipment held for rental or loan of million as a result of continued placement of our laser systems through our rental and evaluation programs  
table of contents an increase in trade accounts receivable of approximately million  due primarily to higher revenue in the latter half of the fourth quarter of as compared to the latter half of the fourth quarter of  with a slight increase in days sales outstanding  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  due primarily to an increase in prepayments for meetings and trade shows scheduled to occur in early  and an increase in inventory of million  due primarily to increases in sales volumes and a slight increase in days on hand 
these uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  due primarily to an increase in accrued commissions and performance based incentive compensation  an increase in accrued royalties and an accrual for the medtronic license agreement dispute settlement costs 
the table below presents the change in receivables and inventory in relative terms  through the presentation of financial ratios 
days sales outstanding are calculated by dividing the ending accounts receivable balance  net of reserves for sales returns and doubtful accounts  by the average daily sales for the quarter 
inventory turns are calculated by dividing annualized cost of sales for the quarter by ending inventory 
december  december  days sales outstanding inventory turns investing activities

borrowings under the revolving line bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lesser of the wells fargo prime rate plus or the daily three month libor plus 
the margins on the base interest rates are subject to reduction if we achieve certain annual net income levels 
accrued interest on any outstanding balance under the revolving line is payable monthly in arrears 
the revolving line of credit is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum of million cash and investments at wells fargo and requires a lockbox arrangement  which provides for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility

during and  we also invested approximately million and million  respectively  in laser equipment held for rental or loan under our rental and evaluation programs 
these amounts are included in cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to fund any capital expenditures in from cash and cash equivalents 
contractual obligations we lease office space  furniture  vehicles and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with initial terms that expire at various dates through purchase obligations consist of purchase orders issued primarily for inventory 
royalty obligations represent the minimum royalties due under license agreements 
clinical trial clinical research organization cro obligations represent contractual monthly payments for services performed and milestone payments to our third party cro for the excite trial 
the future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases  purchase obligations  royalty obligations and clinical trial cro obligations as of december  were as follows in thousands total one year or less years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations royalty obligations clinical trial cro obligations total off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or that are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
healthcare reform in the us we continue to assess the impact that federal healthcare reform will have on our business 
federal healthcare reform includes a excise tax on a majority of our us sales that is scheduled to be implemented in 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those relating to the carrying amount of our investments  the carrying amount of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  valuation allowances and reserves for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation  accrued indemnification costs  estimated outsourcing expense for clinical trials  accrued estimates for incurred but not reported claims under partially self insured employee health benefit programs  and loss contingencies  including those related to litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and the carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
accrued indemnification costs 
as discussed above under results of operations  in august  three former employees with whom we have indemnification obligations were indicted on charges related to a federal investigation 
in the third quarter of  we accrued a million charge reflecting the low end of our estimate of the range of our liability under indemnification obligations 
we currently estimate that our total costs in these matters will total approximately million as compared with the original million estimate 
the decrease in our estimate is the result of the following recent developments 
in february  we entered into certain agreements with the two former employees who were to be tried later in the month 
these agreements gave us increased clarity as to the likely amount of expenses to be incurred through the conclusion of the trials 
thereafter  in february  a trial was held for two of the defendants  which resulted in the acquittal of one defendant on all charges and acquittal of the other defendant on all charges except for one count of making false statements to federal investigators 
on march   the us district court of colorado dismissed the charges against the third defendant who had previously been granted a separate trial 
as a result of the agreements with the former employees  their subsequent jury verdicts and the dismissal of charges against the third defendant  we now believe that our estimate of the remaining legal fees and expenses as of december  can be reasonably determined 
we now estimate that our total costs in these matters will total approximately million as compared with the original million estimate 
the million adjustment to our accrual reduces the remaining liability as of december  to approximately million  which is expected to be paid by june  the actual expenses may be higher or lower than the estimate depending upon final resolution of the proceedings 
factors that may cause us to increase the accrual include but are not limited to the success or failure of an appeal  and in particular  a successful appeal that results in the order of a new trial 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title transfers 
in general  customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund 
however  we allow returns under certain circumstances and record a provision for sales returns based on historical returns experience 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the systems 
our field service engineers are 
table of contents responsible for installation of each laser 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
we recognize revenue from fee for service arrangements upon completion of the related service 
we account for service provided during the one year warranty or service contract period as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with us gaap 
as such  we defer the fair value of this service and recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty or service contract period and warranty and service costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally include delivery and installation of the laser system 
in addition to the sale of laser systems  we also offer laser system placement programs  including flat rate rentals and variable depending on catheter purchases rentals for which we invoice the customer and recognize revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis 
we also offer a cap free program under which the customer does not pay a rental fee  but agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
we recognize the total surcharge as rental revenue upon shipment of the catheters  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser system each month 
under the laser system placement programs  the laser system is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue based upon a five year expected life of the laser system 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we sell to end users in the united states and internationally as well as to certain international distributors 
sales to international distributors represented approximately of our total revenue in distributor agreements are in place with each distributor  which outline the significant terms of the transactions between the distributor and us 
the terms and conditions of sales to our international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
sales to distributors are recognized either at shipment or a later date in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors  provided that we have received an order  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  all contractual obligations have been met and we can reasonably estimate returns 
we provide products to our distributors at agreed wholesale prices and do not typically provide any special right of return or exchange  discounts  significant sales incentives  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based upon an analysis of revenue transactions and historical experience of sales returns and price adjustments 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use judgment in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable  historical experience and the overall quality of the receivables 
we review individual accounts receivable balances for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is remote 
we believe our estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable are reasonable  however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  significant additional allowances could be required 
inventory reserves 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical usage and sales  as well as assumptions about future demand for our products 
we review and update our estimates for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for product demand are consistent with our sales forecasts and are also used for near term production planning and inventory purchasing 
increases in the inventory reserves result in a corresponding expense which is generally recorded to cost of goods sold 
we believe that our estimates for obsolete and excess inventory are reasonable based on facts in 
table of contents existence at the time of estimation 
however  other factors  such as future product introductions  the introduction of competing technologies or changes in market demand  may require additional reserves  which could have a material effect on gross margins in any given period 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which may involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using either the black scholes options pricing model or a trinomial lattice model  both of which require management s estimates and assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including volatility  expected term of the options  and other inputs 
in recognizing stock based compensation expense  we also estimate future forfeitures based on historical forfeiture data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current and prior periods and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
we had valuation allowances of million and million at december  and  respectively  due to the uncertainty about the realization of our us deferred tax assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
we amortize intangible assets with estimable useful lives over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and we review them for impairment annually  or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we amortize our intangible assets  which consist primarily of patents  using the straight line method over periods which currently range from to years 
management must use significant estimates and assumptions in evaluating whether or not impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred  and in evaluating the useful lives of amortized intangible assets 
significant changes in these estimates and management s assumptions may reduce the carrying amount of these intangible assets 
clinical trial costs 
we sponsor clinical trials intended to obtain the necessary clinical data required to obtain approval from the fda and other foreign regulatory agencies to market new applications for our technology 
costs associated with these clinical trials totaled million  million and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred 
in certain cases  substantial portions of our clinical trials are performed by third party cros 
these cros generally bill monthly for services performed and bill based upon milestone achievement 
for example  we have contracted with a cro to provide clinical trial services for the excite isr study 
if we prepay cro fees  we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted services are performed  based upon the number of patients enrolled  patient months incurred and the duration of the study 
we monitor patient enrollment  the progress of clinical studies and related activities through internal reviews of data reported to us by the cros and correspondence with the cros 
our estimates depend on the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by the cros regarding the status of the program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change and our expenses in this area could fluctuate in future periods 
medical self insurance costs 
starting in october  we are partially self insured for certain claims relating to employee medical and dental benefit programs 
the medical self insurance program is administered by a third party and contains stop loss provisions on both an individual claim basis and in the aggregate 
we record claims incurred as an expense each period  including an estimate of claims incurred but not yet paid which is revised quarterly 
we use claims data and historical experience  as applicable  to estimate liabilities 
we believe that our self insurance program accruals are adequate to cover future claims 
historical trends  however  may not be indicative of future claims  and revised estimates could significantly affect future expenses 
new accounting pronouncements in october  an update was made to asc  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
it also replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurements required under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
this update was effective for us beginning january   and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance that requires reporting entities to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements  including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and information on purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
the guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for level reconciliation disclosures that are effective for annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended guidance for presenting comprehensive income 
the amendment will require us to present the components of net income and comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
there will no longer be the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
the amended guidance is effective for us beginning january   on a retrospective basis 
the adoption of this amendment will not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that 
table of contents goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this guidance will be effective for our fiscal year ending december   with early adoption permitted 
we have chosen to adopt this guidance for the year ended december  based on certain qualitative factors  we determined that it was not necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test as it was not more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  primarily including foreign currency fluctuations 
currently  we do not hedge these foreign currency exposures 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated primarily in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  we could incur gains or losses 
fluctuation in currency rates during the year ended december  as compared with the prior year caused an increase in consolidated revenue of approximately million and an increase in consolidated net income of approximately million 
based on our overall foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of december   a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have a positive or negative impact on our consolidated revenue of approximately million
