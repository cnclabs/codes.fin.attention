internet solutions  primarily representing the results of our hoover s business  accounted for of our total revenue for each of the years ended december   and  respectively 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k for a discussion on trends in this customer solutions set 
growth of our internet solutions business depends upon the development of improved and new products targeted to our primary customer segments  as well as the development of internet products targeted to the needs of customer segments outside our core audience 
hoover s  primarily a prospecting tool  provides information on public and private companies  and on industries and executives  sales  marketing and research professionals worldwide 
the database includes industry and company briefs  information on competitors  corporate financials  executive contact information  current news  including social media and research  family trees  and contact information including biographies 
hoover s subscribers access the data online via the subscription service hoover s online 
as part of our strategic technology investment  which we refer to as maxcv for maximizing customer value  we are migrating customers to newer  and higher performing platforms  such as hoover s  while we are shutting down legacy products that will not be supported by our new data supply chain 
our internet solutions help customers convert prospects to clients faster by providing a workflow solution to answer questions such as how do i identify prospects and better prepare for sales calls who are the key senior level decision makers how does the prospect compare to others in their industry our principal internet solutions are our subscription solutions delivered online through hoover s online such as researcher  prospector  relationship manager  executive  and our first research industry data solution and via electronic data feeds  our advertising and e marketing solutions provided through www 
hoovers 
com  www 
firstresearch 
com and related internet sites  and licensing of hoover s proprietary content to third party content providers 
our sales force we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our customers solutions  of which approximately  were in our north american segment and  were in our international segments as of december  our sales force includes relationship managers and solution specialists who sell to our strategic and commercial customers  telesales teams  a team that sells to federal  state and local governments  and a team that sells to resellers of our solutions and our data 
our global sales force is also a source of competitive advantage  which allows us to effectively serve large  medium and small sized customers 

table of contents our customers we believe that different size customers have different needs and require different skill sets to service them 
accordingly  we are organized to effectively serve each of our large  medium and small sized customers 
our principal customers are banks and other credit and financial institutions  manufacturers  wholesalers  retailers  government agencies  insurance companies and telecommunication companies  as well as sales  marketing and business development professionals 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue or of the revenue of our north american  asia pacific or europe and other international markets segments 
accordingly  neither we nor any of our segments is dependent on a single customer  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations or the annual results of any of our segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright quality process 
in north america  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of revenue 
we compete with our customers own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers risk management processes to capture more of their internal spend 
we also directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc 
experian  which have traditionally offered primarily consumer information services  but also offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete in north america with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our sales marketing solutions 
our direct competitors in sales marketing solutions include companies such as equifax and infogroup 
in addition  we face competition in data services from our customers own internal development and from data quality software solutions 
in our internet solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of the customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s researcher  hoover s prospector and hoover s relationship manager products compete with other business information providers such as infogroup 
new  less established entrants are also pursuing some of these same customers 
on the lower end of product pricing  our hoover s essentials ecommerce enabled product  as well as the hoovers acquisition free site mainly compete with advertising supported internet sites  and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and marketwatch  inc outside the us  the competitive environment varies by region and country  and can be significantly impacted by the legislative actions of local governments 
in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as experian in the uk and graydon in belgium and the netherlands 
we believe that we offer superior solutions when compared to these competitors because of our dunsright quality process 
in addition  the sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
in asia  we face competition in our risk management solutions business from a mix of local and global providers 
for example  we compete with sinotrust in china  which is majority owned by experian  with veda in australia and with experian in india 
in addition  as in europe  the sales marketing solutions landscape throughout asia is localized and fragmented 

table of contents we also face significant competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our trusted brand  our dunsright quality process  our winning culture and our financial flexibility form a powerful competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our existing and new products and services based upon our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring and sources of data not publicly available  leverage maxcv to significantly improve our value proposition for customers in order to make d b s data available wherever and whenever our customers need it  as well as our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  maintain those third party relationships on whom we rely for data and certain operational services  and attract and retain a high performing workforce 
intellectual property we own and control various intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  confidential information  trademarks  service marks  trade names  copyrights  patents and applications 
these rights  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
we also believe that the d b name and related trade names  marks and logos are of material importance to our business 
we are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others  and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 
we consider our trademarks  service marks  databases  software  copyrights  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary  and we rely on a combination of statutory eg  copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent  etc 
and contract and liability safeguards for protection thereof throughout the world 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this annual report on form k are trademarks  service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries 
we own patents and patent applications both in the us and in other selected countries of importance to us 
the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection 
we believe that the protection of our innovative technology  especially technology pertaining to our proprietary dunsright quality process such as our proprietary methods for data curation and identity resolution  through the filing of patent applications is a prudent business strategy  and we will continue to seek to protect those assets for which we have expended substantial capital 
filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology 
however  these patents and or patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us 
where appropriate  we may also consider asserting or cross licensing our patents 

table of contents employees as of december   we employed approximately  team members worldwide  of which approximately  were in our north american segment and corporate and approximately  were in our remaining segments 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
there are no unions in the north american segment 
works councils and trade unions represent a portion of our employees in our european and latin american operations

item a 
risk factors our business model is dependent upon third parties to provide data and certain operational services  the loss of which would materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely significantly on third parties to support our business model 
for example we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  including public record sources  we utilize single source providers in certain countries to support the needs of our customers around the globe and rely on members of our d b worldwide network to provide local data in countries in which we do not directly operate  we have outsourced certain portions of our data acquisition  processing and delivery and customer service and call center processes  and we have also outsourced various functions  such as our data center operations  technology help desk and network management functions in the us and the uk 
if one or more data providers were to experience financial or operational difficulties or were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  be unable to make it available due to changing industry standards  substantially increase the cost of their data  not adhere to our data quality standards  or be acquired by a competitor who would cause any of these disruptions to occur  our ability to provide solutions and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
table of contents and financial results 
similarly  if one of our outsource providers  including third parties with whom we have strategic relationships  were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us would suffer or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all  having a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we cannot be certain that we could replace our large third party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us 
if we change a significant outsource provider  an existing provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations  or we seek to bring in house certain services performed today by third parties  we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business performance is dependent upon successful implementation and the ongoing operation of our strategic technology investment  and appropriate investment in our technology infrastructure thereafter  the failure of which could materially impact our business and financial results 
in february  we announced a strategic technology investment program  which we refer to as maxcv for maximizing customer value  aimed at strengthening our leading position in commercial data and improving our current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers 
we will continue to rely in part on third party providers to implement and update certain aspects of our technology infrastructure and to thereafter run certain of such operations both from within d b and from their own remote locations 
upon completion of this investment  we expect that it will simplify and re architect our data supply chain in order to  among other things  supply intra day updates  create a services layer to optimize access to our data for customers and third parties and to make it easier for us to innovate and develop new products  consolidate many of our legacy products to provide fewer but more impactful applications for customers  accelerate revenue growth in our north american segment upon the completion of the investment  and significantly reduce our technology costs upon completion of the investment 
we expect that maxcv will have a total cost of approximately million in the project will largely focus on continuing to rebuild the data supply chain as well as introducing additional web services 
we expect maxcv and the associated spending will be largely complete by the end of however  product and customer migration are now targeted to be concluded in the second half of we may experience additional costs that we do not currently foresee 
in the event we fail to execute on this investment in a timely manner and or without interruption to service  including hiring and retaining appropriate technology personnel  engaging and managing third parties  re architecting our data supply chain  and simplifying our product portfolio while migrating our customers to new products  and maintaining such data and technology operations on an ongoing basis  we will not achieve our expected revenue acceleration or growth  or the anticipated cost savings from this investment  and we could experience a significant competitive disadvantage in the marketplace  such as the inability to offer certain types of new services or to collect certain types of new data  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our solutions to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use and purchase business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding both lower prices and more features from our solutions  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats  and are expecting real time data provided in a manner relevant to them 
if we do not successfully adapt our solutions to our customers preferences  our business and financial results would be materially adversely affected 
specifically  for our larger customers  our continued success will be dependent on our ability to satisfy more of their needs by providing more breadth and depth of data and allowing them more flexibility to use our data through web services and third party solutions 
for our smaller customers  our success will depend in part on our ability to develop a strong value proposition  including simplifying our solutions and pricing offerings  to enhance our marketing efforts to these customers and to improve our service to them 

table of contents upon the successful completion of maxcv  the failure to continue to invest in our business could result in a material adverse effect on our future financial results 
such investments may include i our ability to successfully evolve our workforce away from those third parties who assisted us in the build of maxcv  to internal employees who can successfully execute thereon  ii executing on  and mitigating risks associated with  new product offerings such as daas  and iii ensuring continued compatibility of our new platforms and technologies with our worldwide network partners and other affiliates 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  and credit insurers 
business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
large internet companies can provide low cost alternatives to data gathering and change how our customers perform key activities such as marketing campaigns 
such companies  and other third parties which may not be readily apparent today  may become significant low cost or no cost competitors and adversely impact the demand for our solutions and services  or limit our growth potential 
weak economic conditions can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could adversely impact us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we face competition outside the us  and our competitors could develop an alternative to our d b worldwide network 
we face competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information solutions to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
consumer information companies are seeking to expand their operations more broadly into aspects of the business information space 
while their presence is currently small in the business information market  given the size of the consumer market in which they operate  they have scale advantages in terms of scope of operations and size of relationship with customers  which they can potentially leverage to an advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based upon a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our products and services based upon our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring  and sources of data not publicly available  such as detailed trade data  demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending  obtain and deliver reliable and high quality business and professional contact information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  
table of contents adopt and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure  including our work under maxcv  to support product delivery as customer needs and preferences change and competitors offer more sophisticated products  attract and retain a high performance workforce  enhance our existing services and introduce new services  enter new customer markets  and improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management of the members of our d b worldwide network and through our undertaking of acquisitions or entering into joint ventures or similar relationships 
our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide publicly 
we provide full year financial guidance to the public which is based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance 
this includes  for example  assumptions regarding our ability to grow revenue  to grow operating income  to achieve desired tax rates and to generate cash 
we believe that our financial guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of our view of our near term financial performance 
such financial guidance may not always be accurate  due to our inability to meet the assumptions we make and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors and in our public filings with the sec or otherwise 
if we fail to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance as we conduct our operations throughout the year  the market value of our common stock or other securities could be materially adversely affected 
we may lose key business assets or suffer interruptions in product delivery  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  the theft of services  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and internet sites that we use in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations or change management processes in connection with our introduction of new online products or services to prevent a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to  or failure by our service providers to properly maintain our data centers  failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or internet sites could cause interruptions in operations that adversely affect our ability to meet our customers requirements and materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database  whether inadvertently or through the actions of a third party  which may be on the rise  could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our solutions 
we may experience an increase in risks to the integrity of our database as we move toward real time data feeds  including those from 
table of contents social media sources  upon the completion of maxcv 
we must continue to invest in our database to improve and maintain the quality  timeliness and coverage of the data contained therein if we are to maintain our competitive positioning in the marketplace 
we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the third parties to whom we grant such licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
cybersecurity risks could harm our operations  the operations of our critical outsourcers  or the operations of our partners on whom we rely for data and to meet our customer needs  any of which could materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely upon the security of our information technology infrastructure to protect us from cyber attacks and unauthorized access 
cyber attacks can include malware  computer viruses  or other significant disruption of our information technology it networks and related systems 
government agencies and security experts have warned about growing risks of hackers  cyber criminals and other potential attacks targeting every type of it system 
we may face increasing cyber security risks  as we receive data from new sources  such as social media sites or through data aggregators who provide us with information 
if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system or a security breach of our it systems  the resulting disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also store sensitive information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business which could be compromised by a cyber attack 
to the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data  an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  an inability to access data sources  or an inability to process data for or send data to our customers  it could cause significant damage to our reputation  affect our relationships with our customers  lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 
while we have insurance coverage for certain instances of a cyber security breach  our coverage may not be sufficient if we suffer a significant or multiple attacks 
our outsourcing partners are primarily responsible for the security of our it environment and we rely significantly on third parties to supply clean data content and to resell our products in a secure manner 
all of these third parties face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours which could disrupt their businesses and therefore materially impact ours 
while we provide guidance and specific requirements in some cases  we do not directly control any of such parties it security operations  or the amount of investment they place in guarding against cyber security threats 
accordingly  we are subject to any flaw in or breaches to their it systems or those that they operate for us  which could materially impact our business  operations and financial results 
our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 
our brand and its attributes are key assets of the company 
our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of data quality  effective provision of services  business practices  including actions of our employees  third party providers and members of the d b worldwide network  that are not consistent with d b s policies and standards  and overall financial condition 
negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation with customers and the public  which could make it difficult for us to attract and maintain customers 
adverse developments with respect to our industry may also  by association  negatively impact our reputation  or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny 
although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand  negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents we rely on annual contract renewals for a substantial part of our revenue  and our quarterly results may be significantly impacted by the timing of these renewals or a shift in product mix that results in a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  our results of operations from period to period may vary due to the timing of customer contract renewals 
as contracts are renewed  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  a shift in product mix underlying such contracts 
this could result in the deferral of increased amounts of revenue into future periods as a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of our contracts rather than upfront at contract signing or the acceleration of deferred revenue into an earlier reporting period 
although this may cause our financial results from period to period to vary substantially  such change in revenue recognition would not change the total revenue recognized over the life of our contracts 
we may be adversely affected by the global economic environment 
as a result of the macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states  europe  and other parts of the world  our customers or vendors may experience problems with their earnings  cash flow  or both 
this may cause our customers to delay  cancel or significantly decrease their purchases from us  and we may experience delays in payment or their inability to pay amounts owed to us 
our vendors may substantially increase their prices to us and without notice 
any such change in the behavior of our customers or vendors may materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
if economic conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate further or do not show improvement  we may experience material adverse impacts to our business  operating results  and or access to credit markets 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate could adversely impact our ability to collect  compile  use and publish data and could impact our financial results 
certain types of information we collect  compile  use and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly in our international markets 
there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public  governmental bodies  and others regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations that could adversely impact our business 
in general  compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date materially impacted our business and financial results 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  compilation  use and publication of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information could result in limitations being imposed on our operations  increased compliance or litigation costs and or loss of revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business relies on the availability of the internet as it is currently configured and operated both to obtain data and services and to provide data and services to our customers 
if the rules governing the operation of the internet were to change  such as  for example  by permitting broadband suppliers to discriminate in providing access to their networks  this could have a material adverse impact on our business 
governmental agencies may seek to increase the costs we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data that such governmental agencies collect 
while we would seek to pass along any such price increases to our customers or provide alternative services  there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so  given competitive pressures or other considerations 
should our proportion of multiyear contracts increase  our risk of having to incur such additional costs further increases 
any such price increases or alternative services may result in reduced usage by our customers and or loss of market share  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 

table of contents acquisitions  joint ventures or similar strategic relationships may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies or enter into joint ventures or similar strategic relationships 
these transactions are subject to the following risks acquisitions  joint ventures or similar relationships may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any such transaction into our operations  we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any such transaction  and there may be risks  exposures and liabilities of acquired entities or other third parties with whom we undertake a transaction  that may arise from such third parties activities prior to undertaking a transaction with us 
we have no direct management control over third party members of the d b worldwide network or other third parties who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets or who license and sell under the d b name 
the d b worldwide network is comprised of wholly owned subsidiaries  joint ventures that we either control or hold a minority interest in  and third party members who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets 
while third party member participation in the d b worldwide network and certain of our relationships with other third parties are controlled by commercial services agreements and the use of our trademarks is controlled by license agreements  we have no direct management control over these members or third parties beyond the terms of the agreements 
we license data to certain third parties to be included in the data solutions that they sell to their customers and such arrangements may increase as a percentage of our total revenue in the future 
we do not have direct control over such third parties sales people or practices  and their failure to successfully sell products which include our data will impact the revenue we receive and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
as a result  actions or inactions taken by these third parties may have a material impact on our business and financial results 
for example  one or more third parties or members may provide a product or service that does not adhere to our data quality standards  fail to comply with d b brand and communication standards  engage in illegal or unethical business practices  elect not to support new or revised products and services or other strategic initiatives  fail to execute other data or distribution contract requirements  or refuse to provide new sources of data 
such actions or inactions may have an impact on customer confidence in the d b brand globally  which could materially adversely impact our business and financial results 
our international businesses are subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries  which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
our success depends in part on our various international businesses 
for the three years ended december   and  our businesses outside of north america accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
our international businesses are subject to many of the same challenges as our domestic business  as well as the following our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors which may have a competitive advantage because they are not restricted by us and international laws with which we require our international businesses to comply  such as the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  
table of contents while our services have not usually been regulated  governments  particularly in emerging market areas  may adopt legislation or regulations  or we may learn that our current methods of operation violate existing legislation or regulations  governing the collection  compilation  use and or publication of the kinds of information we collect  compile  use and publish  which could bar or impede our ability to operate and this could adversely impact our business  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets that may reduce the demand for our risk management solutions  and in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customer s need to purchase that data from us 
in addition  the fcpa and anti bribery and anti corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit improper payments to government officials or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we cannot assure you that our policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our employees or third party intermediaries 
from time to time  under appropriate circumstances  we have undertaken and will continue to undertake investigations of the relevant facts and circumstances and  when appropriate  take remedial actions  which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management 
violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions  which could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our international strategy includes the leveraging of our d b worldwide network to improve our data quality 
we form and manage strategic relationships to create a competitive advantage for us over the long term  however  these strategic relationships may not be successful or may be subject to ownership change 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various international markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment 
if our existing business practices were deemed to violate existing data privacy laws or such laws as they may evolve from time to time  our business or the business of third parties on whom we depend could be adversely impacted 
our operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors may include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions  competition from government agencies in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and strategic alliances  including the d b worldwide network  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel  including members of our sales force and technology team  which could impact the quality of our performance and customer satisfaction 
our success and financial results depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel at all levels and to appropriately use the time and resources of such individuals 
this includes members of our sales force on whom we rely for generating the vast majority of our revenue  and members of our technology team on whom we rely to continually maintain and upgrade all of our technology operations and to maintain and develop our products 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or key members of our sales or technology teams  or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees  including members of our sales force and technology team  who have appropriate qualifications 

table of contents we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
successful execution of our strategy includes reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility initiatives  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives to produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to continually adapt and improve our organizational design and efficiency to meet the changing needs of our business and our customers  our ability to implement the actions required under this program within the established time frame  our ability to implement actions that require process or technology changes to reduce our expense base  our ability to enter into or amend agreements with third party vendors to obtain terms beneficial to us  managing third party vendor relationships effectively  completing agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets  and maintaining quality around key business processes utilizing our reduced and or outsourced resources 
if we fail to reduce our expense base  or if we do not achieve our desired level of revenue growth from new initiatives  our business and financial results would be materially adversely affected 
we are involved in legal proceedings that could have a material adverse impact on us 
we are involved in legal proceedings  claims and litigations that arise in the ordinary course of business

on december   we sold our italian real estate business for million  which was a part of our international segment  and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the italian real estate business as discontinued operations 
we have reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented as set forth in this annual report on form k 
we have recorded the resulting gain of million both pre tax and after tax from the sale in the first quarter of in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for information on our revised financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business for internal management purposes  we refer to core revenue  which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses 
core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure 
core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue 
on july   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our north american self awareness solution business 
this business has been classified as a divested business 
this divested business contributed and of our north america total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further detail 
on may   we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our italian operations 
this business has been classified as a divested business 
this divested business contributed of our europe and other international total revenue for the year ended december  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further detail 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
the change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting both our prior and current periods by a constant rate 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excludes the effects of foreign exchange 
from time to time we have analyzed and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
a recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges  which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as financial flexibility 
through financial flexibility  management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of reallocating our spending from low growth or low value activities to activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
management is committed through this process to examining our spending  and optimizing between variable and fixed costs to ensure flexibility in changes to our operating expense base as we make strategic choices 
this enables us to continually and systematically identify improvement opportunities in terms of quality  cost and customer experience 
such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period 
management reviews operating results before such non core gains and charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures 
management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries  target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on performance before non core gains and charges and a significant percentage weight is placed upon performance before non core gains and charges in determining whether 
table of contents performance objectives have been achieved 
management believes that by eliminating non core gains and charges from such financial measures  and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges  business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders  rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for financial information regarding our segments 
similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value 
it may be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges may occur in the future 
we monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases  dividend payments and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for  or superior to  net cash flows provided by operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition  we evaluate our north america risk management solutions based on two metrics subscription  and non subscription  and dnbi and non dnbi 
we define subscription as contracts that allow customers unlimited use 
in these instances  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year and non subscription as all other revenue streams 
we define dnbi as our interactive  customizable online application that offers our customers real time access to our most complete and up to date global dunsright information  comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis and non dnbi as all other revenue streams 
management believes these measures provide further insight into our performance and growth of our north america risk management solutions revenue 
the adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and  as noted above  for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures eg  results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis

of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates  the actual results could have a material impact on such period 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations through june   we offered to substantially all of our us based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account us qualified plan 
the us qualified plan covered active and retired employees 
the benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employee s annual compensation 
the percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranged from to based on age and service 
amounts allocated under the us qualified plan also receive interest credits based on the year treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the internal revenue service 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
during in conjunction with a determination letter review  we updated certain portions of the us qualified plan s cash balance pay credit scale  along with the minimum interest crediting rate  retroactive to january   to ensure that the plan complies with the accrual rules in the internal revenue code 
we received a favorable determination letter for the us qualified plan in october in conjunction with these changes 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the company 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligation  respectively  at december  effective june   we amended the us qualified plan and one of the us non qualified plans  known as the us pension benefit equalization plan the pbep 
any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was 
table of contents frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits  other than interest on such amounts  will accrue under the us qualified plan and the pbep 
our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided with retirement benefits through defined benefit plans  representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 
we also provide various health care for retirees 
us based employees  hired before january   who retire with years of vesting service after age  are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially 
during the first quarter of  we eliminated company paid life insurance benefits for retirees and modified our sharing of the retiree drug subsidy with retirees that were projected to receive 
effective july   we elected to convert the current prescription drug program for retirees over to a group based company sponsored medicare part d program  or employer group waiver plan egwp 
under this change  beginning in  we will use the part d subsidies delivered through the egwp each year to reduce net company retiree medical costs until net company costs are completely eliminated 
at that time  the part d subsidies will be shared with retirees going forward to reduce retiree contributions 
the key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments  discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
the discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios  reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans  rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators  and health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of 
this assumption was in each of the years  and the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december   the us qualified plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
based on the factors noted above  the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually 
for our us plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost by approximately million 
the discount rate used to determine pension cost for our us pension plans was  and for  and  respectively 
for  we decreased the discount rate to from for all our us pension plans 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or 
table of contents losses arise 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods or life expectancy of plan participants to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor 
the purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of december  and were  million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our net periodic pension cost of million  million and million  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and non us plans  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the higher amortization of actuarial loss in for the us qualified plan  which will be included in our pension cost in  is primarily due to a lower discount rate and higher unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in for the us qualified plan related to the investment loss from differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
for our pension plans  we recorded net pension periodic cost of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a major component of the net pension periodic cost is the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
for our pension plans we recorded i for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans  ii for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans  and iii for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans 
at january   the market related value of plan assets of our us qualified plan and the non us plans was  million and million  respectively  compared with the fair value of its plan assets of  million and million  respectively 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity deficit 
we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset  on a plan by plan basis with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  in our shareholders equity deficit  net of tax 
accordingly  the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs 
these unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs are amortized out of equity deficit based on an actuarial calculation each period 
gains losses and prior service costs that arise during the year are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income oci which is then reflected in aoci 
as a result  we recorded a net loss of million and million in oci  net of applicable tax  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  million was recorded to aoci in related to a tax adjustment associated with the enactment of the health care and education reconciliation act 
the increase of the loss in was primarily due to the deterioration of the funded status for the us qualified plan and us non qualified plans at december  funded status for our global pension plans was a deficit of million at december  compared to million at december   driven by worse asset performance for our us qualified plan and the impact of assumption changes for our us qualified plan and us non qualified plans 
the funded status for our us qualified plan was a deficit of million at december  compared to a deficit of million at december

see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding costs of  and assumptions for  our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs 
income taxes and tax contingencies in determining taxable income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we currently have recorded valuation allowances that we will maintain until it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances 
the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction 
any reduction in future taxable income may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance could result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management records the effect of a tax rate or law change on our deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period of enactment 
future tax rate or law changes could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
we recognize potential liabilities and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these tax liabilities are reflected net of related tax loss carryforwards 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  an additional charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following four conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract fee is fixed and determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that collectability is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectability becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is 
table of contents uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes fixed or determinable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our risk management solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow customers unlimited access to risk information 
revenue on this type of contract is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year 
risk information is also sold using monthly or annual contracts that allow customers to purchase our risk information up to the contract amount based on an agreed price list 
once the contract amount is fully used  additional risk information can be purchased at per item prices which may be different than those in the original contract 
revenue on these contracts is recognized on a per item basis as information is purchased and delivered to the customer 
if customers do not use the full amount of their contract and forfeit the unused portion  we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration 
where a data file of risk information is sold with periodic updates to that information  a portion of the revenue related to the updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered  usually on a quarterly or monthly basis over the term of the contract 
revenue related to services  such as monitoring  is recognized ratably over the period of performance 
sales marketing solutions that provide continuous access to our marketing information and business reference databases may include access or hosting fees which are sold on a subscription basis 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year 
where a data file of marketing information is sold  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the marketing data file to the customer 
if the contract provides for periodic updates to that marketing data file  the portion of the revenue related to updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered  usually on a quarterly or monthly basis  over the term of the contract 
internet solutions represent the results of our hoover s business  including our first research division 
hoover s and first research provide subscription solutions that allow continuous access to our business information databases 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year 
any additional solutions purchased are recognized upon delivery to the customer 
sales of software that are considered to be more than incidental are recognized in revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed  if required 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed 
multiple element arrangements effective january   we adopted accounting standards update asu  revenue recognition multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends guidance in accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements  on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after that date 
the new standard provides updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the elements in an arrangement should be separated  and how the consideration should be allocated  requires an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using the best estimated selling prices besp of each element if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling prices vsoe or third party evidence of selling price tpe  and eliminates the use of the residual method and requires a vendor to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 

table of contents we have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements 
the multiple element arrangements or deliverables may include access to our business information database  information data files  periodic data refreshes  software and services 
we evaluate each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
most product and service deliverables qualify as separate units of accounting and can be sold standalone or in various combinations across our markets 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and there are no customer negotiated refunds or return rights for the delivered items 
if the arrangement includes a customer negotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered items  and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control  the delivered item constitutes a separate unit of accounting 
the new guidance requires for deliverables with standalone value in a multi element arrangement for which revenue was previously deferred due to undelivered elements not having fair value of selling price to be separated and recognized as delivered  rather than over the longest service delivery period as a single unit with other elements in the arrangement 
if the deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria  the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative selling price 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe  if it exists  tpe if vsoe does not exist  or besp if neither vsoe nor tpe exist 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
consistent with our methodology under the previous accounting guidance  we determine vsoe of a deliverable by monitoring the price at which we sell the deliverable on a standalone basis to third parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial arrangement 
in certain instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements 
this may be due to us infrequently selling each element separately  not pricing products or services within a set range  or only having a limited sales history 
where we are unable to establish vsoe  we may use the price at which we or a third party sell a similar product to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis 
generally  our offerings contain a level of differentiation such that comparable pricing of solutions with similar functionality or delivery cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are rarely able to reliably determine what similar competitors selling prices are on a standalone basis 
therefore  we typically are not able to determine tpe of selling price 
when we are unable to establish selling prices by using vsoe or tpe  we establish the besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the solution were sold on a standalone basis 
the determination of besp is based on our review of available data points and consideration of factors such as but not limited to pricing practices  our growth strategy  geographies  and customer segment and market conditions 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval of our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategy 
we regularly review vsoe and have a review process for tpe and besp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
the adoption of this new authoritative guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
prior to january  and pursuant to the previous accounting standards  we allocated revenue in a multiple element arrangement to each deliverable based on its relative fair value 
if we did not have fair value for the delivered items  the contract fee was allocated to the undelivered items based on their fair values and the remaining residual amount  if any  was allocated to the delivered items 
after the arrangement consideration  we applied the appropriate revenue recognition method from those described above for each unit of accounting  
table of contents assuming all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
all deliverables that did not meet the separation criteria were combined with an undelivered unit of accounting 
we generally recognized revenue for a combined unit of accounting based on the method most appropriate for the last delivered item 
deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information solutions and generally relates to deferral of subscription revenue 
deferred revenue is included in current liabilities in the balance sheet and is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales where we act as an agent or broker in the transaction 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangibles with an indefinite life are not subject to regular periodic amortization 
instead  the carrying amount of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is tested for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events or circumstances warrant such a test 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
we assess recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment which is a business and for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by a segment manager 
our reporting units are north america  united kingdom  benelux  latin america  partnerships  japan  greater china  australia and india 
when applicable  we will perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
if we determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step impairment test would be required 
otherwise  no further testing would be needed 
we perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the market approach and also in certain instances use the income approach to further validate our results 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of current year earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for each individual reporting unit 
for the market approach  we use judgment in identifying the relevant comparable company market multiples ie  recent divestitures acquisitions  facts and circumstances surrounding the market  dominance  growth rate  etc as of our most recent impairment analysis  the current year ebitda multiples used to determine the individual reporting unit s fair value range from to for the income approach  we used projections based on management s most recent view of the long term outlook for each reporting unit 
factors specific to each reporting unit including revenue growth  profit margins  terminal value growth rates  capital expenditures projections  assumed tax rates  discount rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management 
for our year end impairment analysis  the discount rates used to determine the individual reporting unit s fair value range from to 
in the first step  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  goodwill is not impaired and no further test is performed 
however  if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the magnitude of the impairment  which is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill compared to the carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its identifiable net assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  the impaired goodwill is written down to its implied fair value and an impairment loss equal to this difference is recorded in the period the impairment is identified as an operating expense 

table of contents our determination of current year ebitda multiples are sensitive to the risk of future variances due to market conditions as well as business unit execution risks 
management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units  including recent operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and other data 
ebitda multiples can also be significantly impacted by the future growth opportunities for the reporting unit as well as for the company itself  general market and geographic sentiment  and pending or recently completed merger transactions 
consequently  if future results fall below our forward looking projections for an extended period of time  the results of future impairment tests could indicate impairment exists 
although we believe the multiples of current year ebitda in our market approach make reasonable assumptions about our business  a significant increase in competition or reduction in our competitive capabilities could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to retain market share and thus on the projected values included in the market approach used to value our reporting units 
as a reasonableness check  we reconcile the estimated fair values derived in the valuations for the total company based on the individual reporting units to total d b s enterprise value calculated by multiplying the closing price of d b s stock on december  by the number of shares outstanding at that time  adjusted for the value of the company s debt 
at december   each of our reporting units had a fair value of at least in excess of its carrying value 
the allocated goodwill by reportable segment is as follows in millions number of reporting units as of december  as of december  north america asia pacific europe and other international markets for indefinite lived intangibles  other than goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the estimated fair value is determined by utilizing the expected present value of the future cash flows of the assets 
no impairment charges related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets have been recognized for the fiscal years ended december   and recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for disclosure of the impact that recently issued accounting standards may have on our audited consolidated financial statements

matters impacting both operating expenses and selling and administrative expenses pension  postretirement and k plan for our pension plans globally  we had a net pension periodic cost of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the pension cost was due to the following expected return on plan assets is a major component of the net pension periodic cost 
expected return on plan assets included in annual pension expense for all global plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
the decrease of expected return on plan assets was primarily due to lower market related value of plan assets driven by the asset loss incurred in actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense was also a major factor in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year 
actuarial loss amortization was largely impacted by the discount rate  amortization period and plan experience 
the lower the discount rate  the higher the loss amortization 
actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million were attributable to our us plans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
higher actuarial loss amortization in the us plans was primarily due to lower discount rates applied to our plans at january  and higher actuarial losses subject to amortization 
lower actuarial loss amortization in the us plans in compared to was primarily driven by a longer amortization period 
table of contents applied to the us qualified plan  substantially offset by the impact of lower discount rates applied to our plans at january  and higher actuarial losses subject to amortization 
starting in november  the amortization period applied to the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses for our us qualified plan has been changed from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants 
the change was the result of almost all the plan participants being deemed inactive 
the discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our us plans for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in actuarial loss amortization was substantially offset by lower interest cost  a component of net periodic pension costs 
interest cost included in the net periodic pension costs was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and  of which million  million and million  respectively  were attributable to our us plans for the years ended december   and decrease of interest cost for our us plans was due to lower discount rates 
we expect that the net pension cost in will be approximately million for all of our global pension plans  of which approximately million and million will be attributable to the us plans and us plans  respectively 
this compares to a net pension cost of million in  of which million and million attributable to the us plans and us plans  respectively 
for our us plans  the increase in pension cost in is primarily driven by lower expected return from plan assets 
for  we will use an expected long term rate of return of  a basis points decrease  from used for additionally  lower expected return from plan assets is also due to lower market related value of plan assets  which will increase our net pension cost 
higher actuarial losses amortization in will be substantially offset by lower interest cost  both driven by a lower discount rate 
the discount rate applied to our us plans at january  is  a basis points decrease from the discount rate used for we had postretirement benefit income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
higher income in compared to was primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credits 
effective july   in connection with the health care and education reconciliation act of  we converted the then current prescription drug program for retirees over to a group based company sponsored medicare part d program  or egwp 
beginning in  we will use the part d subsidies delivered through the egwp each year to reduce net company retiree medical costs until net company costs are completely eliminated 
at that time  the part d subsidies will be shared with retirees going forward to reduce retiree contributions 
as a result  we reduced our accumulated postretirement obligation by million in the third quarter of  which will be amortized over approximately four years 
higher income in compared to was primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credits 
during the first quarter of  the retiree company paid life insurance benefits were eliminated 
in addition  we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible 
this plan change was approved in december and as a result we reduced our accumulated postretirement obligation by approximately million at december   which will be amortized over approximately four years 
both plan changes were accounted for as plan amendments under asc  compensation retirement benefits 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately million in  essentially the same as we had expense associated with our k plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in expense in was due to a higher discretionary company contribution of million resulting from company performance  compared to million in in addition  we amended our employer matching provision in the k plan  effective in 
table of contents april  to increase the employer maximum match from of three percent to of seven percent of a team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations 
the increase in expense in from was due to an incremental discretionary company contribution of million resulting from company performance as well as the increased employer maximum match percentage resulting from the plan amendment as described above effective in april we consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs  and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation for the years ended december   and  we recognized total stock based compensation expense eg  stock options  restricted stock  etc 
of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the stock options issued over the past several years 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily driven by our forfeiture assumption true up as well as the continuing impact of the decrease in the overall number of employees eligible for stock options 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our restricted stock  restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity programs of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of the awards issued over the past several years as well as lower expense as a result of higher forfeitures associated with terminated employees 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily driven by lower expense as a result of higher forfeitures associated with terminated employees as well as fewer awards being issued in as compared to the same period in  partially offset by the accelerated expensing of an award issued to a retiree eligible executive 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan espp of million  million and million  respectively 
we consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
depreciation and amortization year ended december  vs 
year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and increased capital costs for investments to enhance our strategic capabilities eg  strategic technology investment or maxcv 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase for the year ended december  was primarily driven by an 
table of contents increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures  increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities and our strategic technology investment or maxcv 
this increase was partially offset by a reassessment in of the useful lives of our computer software discussed in further detail below 
we review the estimated remaining useful lives of our computer software and may extend the useful life when events and circumstances indicate the computer software can operate beyond its original or current useful life 
prior to the second quarter of  the useful life of computer software assets was typically three to five years 
we now expect the useful life of our back end and back office software to be in the range of five to eight years  and we have extended the useful lives accordingly 
this reassessment included a review of the major components of our strategy and consideration of the effects of obsolescence  technology  competition and other economic factors on the useful life of these assets 
the impact of this change was effective in the second quarter of  and the impact for the year ended december  was a reduction in software amortization expense by approximately million after tax per diluted share 
restructuring charge financial flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
with most initiatives  we have incurred restructuring charges which generally consist of employee severance and termination costs  contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income 
these charges are incurred as a result of eliminating  consolidating  standardizing and or automating our business functions 
restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with asc  nonretirement postemployment benefits  or asc  and or asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  or asc  as appropriate 
we record severance costs provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of asc we account for one time termination benefits  contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income in accordance with asc  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities 
under asc  we establish a liability for cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  including severance and lease termination obligations  and other related costs  when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date that we commit to an exit plan 
we reassess the expected cost to complete the exit or disposal activities at the end of each reporting period and adjust our remaining estimated liabilities  if necessary 
the determination of when we accrue for severance costs and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing arrangement as described in asc or under a one time benefit arrangement as defined by asc inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings  we had to make estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings

market risk we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions 
we may also use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our net investments in our foreign subsidiaries and foreign exchange option 
table of contents contracts to reduce the volatility that fluctuating foreign exchange rates may have on our international earnings streams 
in addition  we may use interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt or in anticipation of a future debt issuance  as discussed under interest rate risk management below 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
if a hedging instrument ceases to qualify as a hedge in accordance with hedge accounting guidelines  any subsequent gains and losses are recognized currently in income 
collateral is generally not required for these types of instruments 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk management our objective in managing exposure to interest rates is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on our earnings  cash flows and financial position  and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a policy that floating rate debt be managed within a minimum and maximum range of our total debt exposure 
to manage our exposure and limit volatility  we may use fixed rate debt  floating rate debt and or interest rate swaps 
we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the statement of financial position 
fair value hedges for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  we assess quarterly whether the swaps are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged debt 
changes in fair values of interest rate swap agreements that are designated fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as an adjustment of other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
the effectiveness of the hedge is monitored on an ongoing basis for hedge accounting purposes  and if the hedge is considered ineffective  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
in november  we issued senior notes with a face value of million that mature on november  the notes 
in november and december  we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million 
the objective of these hedges is to offset the change in fair value of the fixed rate notes attributable to changes in libor 
these transactions are accounted for as fair value hedges 
we recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item  in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
approximately million of derivative gains offset by a million loss on the fair value adjustment related to the hedged debt were recorded through december  approximately million of derivative losses offset by a million gain on the fair value adjustment related to the hedged debt were recorded through december  cash flow hedges for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the periodic hedge remeasurement gains or losses on the derivative are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
in january and december  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively  and designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow 
table of contents hedges against variability in cash flows related to our then existing million credit facility 
these transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges and  as such  changes in the fair value of the hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income oci 
in connection with the termination of the million credit facility  these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated  resulting in an acceleration of payments otherwise due under the instruments of million on october   the credit facility termination date and were recorded in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
a basis point increase decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to rate variability at december  would result in incremental increase decrease in annual interest expense of approximately million 
foreign exchange risk management we have numerous offices in various countries outside north america and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local providers 
our operations outside of north america generated approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our assets as of december  and  respectively  were located outside of the us our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
in addition  we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and net investments in our foreign subsidiaries 
we use short term  foreign exchange forward and option contracts to execute our hedging strategies 
typically  these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollar 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions are recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term foreign exchange forward contracts 
in addition  we may use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings streams and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
the underlying transactions and the corresponding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter and the fair value impacts are reflected within our consolidated financial statements
