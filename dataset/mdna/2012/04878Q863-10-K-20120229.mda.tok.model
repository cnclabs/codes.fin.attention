item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
all dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands of us dollars  unless otherwise stated 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
overview of our business atlantic power corporation owns and operates a diverse fleet of power generation and infrastructure assets in the united states and canada 
our power generation projects sell electricity to utilities and other large commercial customers largely under long term power purchase agreements  which seek to minimize exposure to changes in commodity prices 
our power generation projects in operation have an aggregate gross electric generation capacity of approximately  mw in which our ownership interest is approximately  mw 
our current portfolio consists of interests in operational power generation projects across states in the united states and two provinces in canada  one mw biomass project under construction in georgia  and a kilovolt mile electric transmission line located in california 
we also own a majority interest in rollcast energy  a biomass power plant developer with several projects under development  and a common equity interest in perh 
twenty three of our projects are wholly owned subsidiaries 
we sell the capacity and energy from our power generation projects under power purchase agreements with a variety of utilities and other parties 
under the ppas  which have expiration dates ranging from to  we receive payments for electric energy sold to our customers known as energy payments  in addition to payments for electric generation capacity known as capacity payments 
we also sell steam from a number of our projects under steam sales agreements to industrial purchasers 
the transmission system rights we own in our power transmission project entitle us to payments indirectly from the utilities that make use of the transmission line 
our power generation projects generally operate pursuant to long term fuel supply agreements  typically accompanied by fuel transportation arrangements 
in most cases  the fuel supply and transportation arrangements correspond to the term of the relevant ppas and many of the ppas and steam sales agreements provide for the indexing or pass through of fuel costs to our customers 
in cases where there is not an effective pass through of fuel costs  we attempt to mitigate a significant portion of the market price risk of fuel purchases through the use of hedging strategies 
while we operate and maintain more than half of our power generation fleet  we also partner with recognized leaders in the independent power industry to operate and maintain our other projects  including caithness energy  llc  cem  ppms and western 
under these operation  maintenance and management agreements  the operator is typically responsible for operations  maintenance and repair services 
we revised our reportable business segments during the fourth quarter of upon completion of the partnership acquisition 
the new operating segments are northeast  northwest  southeast  southwest and un allocated corporate 
our financial results for the years ended december  and have been presented to reflect these changes in operating segments 
we revised our segments to align with changes in management s resource allocation and performance assessment in making decisions regarding our operations 
these changes reflect our current operating focus 
the segment classified as un allocated corporate includes activities that support the executive offices  capital structure and costs of being a public registrant 
these costs are not allocated to the operating segments when determining segment profit or loss 

table of contents current trends in our business macroeconomic impacts the recession caused significant decreases in both peak electricity demand and consumption that varied by region  although as always  summer and winter peak demand will also be greatly influenced by weather 
this has had the effect of delaying projected increases in capacity requirements to varying degrees by region 
typically  electricity demand makes a strong recovery to pre recession levels along with the economic recovery and the projected delays in capacity needs tend to revert to some extent as well  depending on the pace of the recovery 
the reduced electricity peak demand and consumption during a recession tends to impact base load plants that typically operate at all times and peaking plants those that only operate in periods of very high demand more than mid merit plants those that operate for a portion of most days  but not at night or in other lower demand periods 
during recessionary periods  base load plants may be called on for lower levels of off peak generation and peaking plants may be called on less frequently as a function of their efficiency and the overall peak demand level 
the actual financial impacts on particular plants depend on whether contractual provisions  such as minimum load levels and or significant capacity payments  partially mitigate the impact of reduced demand 
one other recession related industry impact was an easing of commodity costs  whose previous escalation had greatly increased new plant construction costs 
the economic recovery has moved prices higher again for copper  steel and other inputs  with labor costs a function of regional power plant and general construction activity levels  which in some locations includes increased renewable project construction 
increased renewable power projects the combination of federal stimulus and other tax provisions in the us and canada  state renewable portfolio standards and state or regional co greenhouse gases reduction programs has provided powerful incentives to build new renewable power capacity 
one simple impact of this trend is the offsetting reduction in new fossil fired generation  with the following exception  because significant renewable capacity is being built as intermittent resources eg  wind and solar there will be an increased need by system operators to have more firming resources 
these are units that can be started quickly or idle at low levels in order to be available to compensate for sudden decreases in output from the solar or wind projects 
these firming resources are generally natural gas fired generators or  in more limited locations  pumped storage or reservoir based hydro resources 
the second significant impact of increased renewable projects is the increased need for new transmission lines to move power from renewable resources in typically more remote locations  to the more highly populated electricity load centers 
this transmission requirement will require significant capital and tends to encounter a long and risky development  siting and regulatory process 
increased shale gas resources the substantial additions of economically viable shale gas reserves and increasing production levels have put strong downward pressure on natural gas prices in both the spot and forward markets 
one impact of the reduced prices is that gas fired generators have displaced some generation from base load coal plants  particularly in the southeast us lower natural gas prices also have compressed  and in some cases turned negative  the spark spread  which is the industry term for the profit margin between spot market fuel and power prices 
reduced spark spreads directly impact the profitability of plants selling power into the spot market with no contract  which are referred to as merchant plants 
the lower power prices can have an adverse impact on development of new renewable projects whose owners are attempting to negotiate power purchase agreements at favorable levels to support the financing and construction of the projects 
the expectation of reduced future volatility of gas prices due to increased supply has reinforced a growing expectation of the role of natural gas as a bridging fuel  
table of contents helping from a carbon policy perspective to bridge the desired us transition to both cleaner fuels and more commercially viable carbon removal and sequestration technologies 
credit markets weak and volatile credit markets over the past three years reduced the number of lenders providing power project financing  as well as the size and length of loans  resulting in higher costs for such financing 
this reduces the number of new power projects that could be feasibly financed and built 
credit market conditions for project lending have generally improved  but are still weaker than pre recession levels 
however  base lending rates such as libor have stayed quite low by historical standards  somewhat compensating for the increased interest rate spreads demanded by lenders 
corporate level credit markets experienced similar adverse impacts  which impeded the ability of many development companies to obtain financing for new power projects 
factors that may influence our results our primary objective is to generate consistent levels of cash flow to support dividends to our shareholders  which we refer to as cash available for distribution 
because we believe that our shareholders are primarily focused on income and secondarily on capital appreciation  we provide supplementary cash flow based non gaap information in item and discuss our results in terms of these non gaap measures  in addition to analysis of our results on a gaap basis 
see supplementary non gaap financial information below for additional details 
the primary components of our financial results are i the financial performance of our projects  ii non cash unrealized gains and losses associated with derivative instruments and iii interest expense and foreign exchange impacts on corporate level debt 
we have recorded net losses in four of the past five years  primarily as a result of non cash losses associated with items ii and iii above  which are described in more detail in the following paragraphs 
financial performance of our projects the operating performance of our projects supports cash distributions that are made to us after all operating  maintenance  capital expenditures and debt service requirements are satisfied at the project level 
our projects are able to generate cash available for distribution because they generally receive revenues from long term contracts that provide relatively stable cash flows 
risks to the stability of these distributions include the following while approximately of our power generation revenue in was related to contractual capacity payments  commodity prices do influence our variable revenues and the cost of fuel 
our ppas are generally structured to minimize our risk to fluctuations in commodity prices by passing the cost of fuel through to the utility and its customers  but some of our projects do have exposure to market power and fuel prices 
for example  a portion of the natural gas required for projects in our southeast segment is purchased at spot market prices but not effectively passed through in their ppas 
our orlando project should benefit from switching to market prices for natural gas when its fuel contract expires in since the contract prices are above current and projected spot prices 
we have executed a hedging strategy to partially mitigate this risk 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional details about our hedging program at our southeast segment projects 
our most significant exposure to market power prices exists at the selkirk  chambers and morris projects 
at chambers  our utility customer has the right to sell a portion of the plant s output to the spot power market if it is economical to do so  and the chambers project shares in the profits from those sales 
with low demand for electricity the utility reduces its dispatch to minimum contracted levels during off peak hours 
at selkirk  approximately of the capacity of the 
table of contents facility is currently not contracted and is sold at market power prices or not sold at all if market prices do not support profitable operation of that portion of the facility 
additionally at morris  approximately of the facility s capacity is currently not contracted and is sold at market power prices or not sold at all if market prices do not support profitable operation of the facility 
when revenue or fuel contracts at our projects expire  we may not be able to sell power or procure fuel under new arrangements that provide the same level or stability of project cash flows 
in particular  the power agreements for our kenilworth facility expires in and our lake  auburndale and greeley projects expire in we expect these projects to continue operating under new ppas and generating cash available for distribution after their existing power contracts expire  but at significantly lower levels 
the degree of the expected decline in cash available for distribution is subject to market conditions when we execute new power agreements for these projects and is difficult to estimate at this time 
these projects will be free of debt when their ppas expire  which provides us with some flexibility to pursue the most economic type of contract without restrictions that might be imposed by project level debt 
some of our projects have non recourse project level debt that can restrict the ability of the project to make cash distributions 
the project level debt agreements typically contain cash flow coverage ratio tests that restrict the project s cash distributions if project cash flows do not exceed project level debt service requirements by a specified amount 
the selkirk  gregory and delta person projects and epsilon power partners  the holding company for our ownership in the chambers project  are currently not meeting their cash flow coverage ratio tests and they are restricted from making cash distributions 
we expect to resume receiving distributions from selkirk in  gregory and delta person in and epsilon power partners in see the project level debt section of liquidity and capital resources project level debt for additional details 
non cash gains and losses on derivatives instruments in the ordinary course of our business  we execute natural gas swap contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  forward foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates on variable rate project level debt 
most of these contracts are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded currently in earnings  resulting in significant volatility in our income that does not significantly affect current period cash flows or the underlying risk management purpose of the derivative instruments 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional details about our derivative instruments 
interest expense and other costs associated with debt interest expense relates to both non recourse project level debt and corporate level debt 
our convertible debentures and long term corporate level debt are denominated in canadian dollars 
these debt instruments are revalued at each balance sheet date based on the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date  with changes in the value of the debt recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the us dollar to canadian dollar foreign exchange rate has been volatile in recent years  which in turn creates volatility in our results due to the revaluation of our canadian dollar denominated debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information be included in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us 
table of contents to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates  and any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining fair values of acquired assets  the useful lives and recoverability of property  plant and equipment and ppas  the recoverability of equity investments  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the valuation of shares associated with our long term incentive plan and the fair value of derivatives 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  these policies are discussed below 
acquired assets when we acquire a business  a portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to identifiable assets  such as property  plant and equipment  power purchase agreements or fuel supply agreements 
fair value of these assets is determined primarily using the income approach  which requires us to project future cash flows and apply an appropriate discount rate 
we amortize tangible and intangible assets with finite lives over their expected useful lives 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
incorrect estimates could result in future impairment charges  and those charges could be material to our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets and equity investments long lived assets  which include property  plant and equipment  transmission system rights and other intangible assets and liabilities subject to depreciation and amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets by factoring in the probability weighting of different courses of action available 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
we calculate the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate representative of the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
we also consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may consider prices of similar assets  consult with brokers or employ other valuation techniques 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations 
however  actual results could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material 
investments in and the operating results of or less owned entities not required to be consolidated are included in the consolidated financial statements on the basis of the equity method of accounting 
we review our investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be fully 
table of contents recoverable 
evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary might include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment  the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment  failure of cash flow coverage ratio tests included in project level  non recourse debt or  where applicable  estimated sales proceeds which are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the investment 
our assessment as to whether any decline in value is other than temporary is based on our ability and intent to hold the investment and whether evidence indicating the carrying value of the investment is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs evidence to the contrary 
when we determine that an impairment test is required  the future projected cash flows from the equity investment are the most significant factor in determining whether impairment exists and  if so  the amount of the impairment charges 
we use our best estimates of market prices of power and fuel and our knowledge of the operations of the project and our related contracts when developing these cash flow estimates 
in addition  when determining fair value using discounted cash flows  the discount rate used can have a material impact on the fair value determination 
discount rates are based on our risk of the cash flows in the estimate  including  when applicable  the credit risk of the counterparty that is contractually obligated to purchase electricity or steam from the project 
we generally consider our investments in our equity method investees to be strategic long term investments that comprise a significant portion of our core operating business 
therefore  we complete our assessments with a long term view 
if the fair value of the investment is determined to be less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded based on the excess of the carrying value over the best estimate of fair value of the investment 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as previously discussed with respect to undiscounted cash flows 
actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material 
goodwill at december   we reported goodwill of million  consisting of million resulting from the november  acquisition of the partnership  million associated with the path project in the southwest segment and million that is associated with the step up acquisition of rollcast in march in un allocated corporate segment 
see note  acquisitions and divestments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we apply an accounting standard under which goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized 
goodwill is tested for impairments at least annually  or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which is identified by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount  where necessary  our goodwill will be impaired at that time 
we did not perform an annual impairment assessment for goodwill recorded resulting from the partnership acquisition as no changes occurred that would impact the fair value attributed during the purchase price allocation performed at the acquisition date 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of december   for path and rollcast which are at the operating segment levels 
we determined the fair value of these reporting units using an income approach 
significant inputs to the determination of fair value were as follows path we applied a discounted cash flow methodology to the project s long term budget 
this approach is consistent with that used to determine fair value in prior years 
the cash flows in 
table of contents the budget are based on our estimated allowable future recoveries by the ferc for transmission revenue 
rollcast we applied a discounted cash flow methodology to rollcast s long term budget 
this approach is consistent with that used to determine fair value in prior years 
the cash flows in the budget are based on our estimated future cash flows from projects currently in development and expected to be placed into service or sold 
if fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
under the income approach described above  we estimated the fair value of path to exceed its carrying value by approximately and the fair value of rollcast to exceed its carrying value by approximately at december  our estimate of fair value under the income approach described above is affected primarily by assumptions about the results of future rate cases and the ability of rollcast to develop future biomass projects 
our estimates for path are based on prior rate case settlements 
estimating allowed recoveries from a regulatory agency contains significant uncertainty 
if the results of future cases are not consistent with past results  our goodwill may become impaired  which would result in a non cash charge  not to exceed million 
if rollcast is unable to complete development of its budgeted projects our goodwill may become impaired  which would result in a non cash charge  not to exceed million 
fair value of derivatives we utilize derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices and foreign currency and to balance our exposure to variable interest rates 
we believe that these derivatives are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
in determining fair value for our derivative assets and liabilities  we generally use the market approach and incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about market risk and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation techniques 
a fair value hierarchy exists for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs level or level and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs level by requiring that the observable inputs be used when available 
our derivative instruments are classified as level the fair values of our derivative instruments are based upon trades in liquid markets 
valuation model inputs can generally be verified and valuation techniques do not involve significant judgment 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange prices  time value  volatility factors and credit exposure 
the fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk free interest rate 
we also adjust the fair value of financial assets and liabilities to reflect credit risk  which is calculated based on our credit rating and the credit rating of our counterparties 
certain derivative instruments qualify for a scope exception to fair value accounting  as they are considered normal purchases or normal sales 
the availability of this exception is based upon the assumption that we have the ability and it is probable to deliver or take delivery of the underlying physical commodity 
derivatives that are considered to be normal purchases and normal sales are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are recorded as executory contracts 
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon projected future taxable income in the united states and in 
table of contents canada and available tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is comprised primarily of provisions against available canadian and us net operating loss carryforwards 
long term incentive plan the officers and certain other employees of atlantic power are eligible to participate in the ltip that was implemented in in the second quarter of  the board of directors approved an amendment to the ltip and the amended plan was approved by our shareholders on june  the amended ltip became effective for grants beginning with the performance year 
under the amended ltip  the notional units granted to plan participants will have the same characteristics as notional units under the old ltip 
however  the number of notional units that vest will be based  in part  on the total shareholder return of atlantic power compared to a group of peer companies in canada 
in addition  vesting of the notional units for officers of atlantic power will occur on a three year cliff basis as opposed to ratable vesting over three years for officers grants made prior to the amendments 
unvested notional units are entitled to receive dividends equal to the dividends per common share during the vesting period in the form of additional notional units 
unvested units are subject to forfeiture if the participant is not an employee at the vesting date or  for officers  if we do not meet certain performance targets 
compensation expense related to awards granted to participants in the ltip is recorded over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date for notional units accounted for as equity awards and the fair value of the award at each balance sheet date for notional units accounted for as liability awards 
the fair value of the awards granted prior to the amendment is determined by projecting the total number of notional units that will vest in future periods  including dividends accrued monthly as incremental notional units during the vesting period  and applying the current market price per share to the projected number of notional units that will vest 
the fair value of awards granted for the performance period and after with market vesting conditions is based upon a monte carlo simulation model on their grant date 
the aggregate number of shares which may be issued from treasury under the amended ltip is limited to  unvested notional units are recorded as either a liability or equity award based on management s intended method of redeeming the notional units when they vest 
recent accounting developments adopted in september  the fasb issued changes to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
these changes provide an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  go directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
these changes become effective for any goodwill impairment test performed on january  or later 
we early adopted these changes for our annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter of these changes did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued changes to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
these changes require an entity to perform all steps in the test for a reporting unit whose carrying value is 
table of contents zero or negative if it is more likely than not more than that a goodwill impairment exists based on qualitative factors  resulting in the elimination of an entity s ability to assert that such a reporting unit s goodwill is not impaired and additional testing is not necessary despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate otherwise 
we adopted these changes beginning january  based on the most recent impairment review of our goodwill fourth quarter  we determined these changes did not impact the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations 
these changes clarify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
also  the existing supplemental pro forma disclosures were expanded to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
we adopted these changes beginning january  these changes are reflected in note  acquisitions and divestments 
issued in may  the fasb issued changes to conform existing guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
these changes both clarify the fasb s intent about the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and amend certain principles or requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the clarifying changes relate to the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity  and disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used for level fair value measurements 
the amendments relate to measuring the fair value of financial instruments that are managed within a portfolio  application of premiums and discounts in a fair value measurement  and additional disclosures concerning the valuation processes used and sensitivity of the fair value measurement to changes in unobservable inputs for those items categorized as level  a reporting entity s use of a nonfinancial asset in a way that differs from the asset s highest and best use  and the categorization by level in the fair value hierarchy for items required to be measured at fair value for disclosure purposes only 
these changes become effective on january  these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity was eliminated 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
we will adopt these changes on january  other than the change in presentation  these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements

supplementary non gaap financial information the key measure we use to evaluate the results of our business is cash available for distribution 
cash available for distribution is not a measure recognized under gaap  does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers 
we believe cash available for distribution is a relevant supplemental measure of our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to cash available for distribution is set out below under cash available for distribution 
investors are cautioned that we may calculate this measure in a manner that is different from other companies 

table of contents the primary factor influencing cash available for distribution is cash distributions received from the projects 
these distributions received are generally funded from project adjusted ebitda generated by the projects  reduced by project level debt service and capital expenditures  and adjusted for changes in project level working capital and cash reserves 
project adjusted ebitda is defined as project income plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization including non cash impairment charges and changes in fair value of derivative instruments 
project adjusted ebitda is not a measure recognized under gaap and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies

project cash flows may have some seasonality and the pattern and frequency of distributions to us from the projects during the year can also vary  although such seasonal variances do not typically have a material impact on our business 
cash flow from operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to approximately million in transaction expenses related to the partnership acquisition during and the timing of the five ontario projects in the northeast segment november receivables received in early january of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by an increase of approximately million of earnings and distributions from our equity investment projects 
cash flow from operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to a significant decrease in cash interest expense as a result of our common share conversion in november  which eliminated cdn million million of outstanding subordinated notes  as well as higher net cash tax refunds of million 
the positive change in operating cash flow attributable to the reduced interest expense was partially offset by a million decrease in distributions from our orlando project and no distributions in from our selkirk project  both of which are equity method investments 
the decrease in distributions from orlando was the result of a one time receipt of insurance proceeds in related to an unplanned outage that occurred in investing activities cash flow from investing activities includes changes in restricted cash 
restricted cash fluctuates from period to period in part because non recourse project level financing arrangements typically require all operating cash flow from the project to be deposited in restricted accounts and then released at the time that principal payments are made and project level debt service coverage ratios are met 
as a result  the timing of principal payments on project level debt causes significant fluctuations in restricted cash balances  which typically benefits investing cash flow in the second and fourth quarters of the year and decreases investing cash flow in the first and third quarters of the year 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to cash flows used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the change is due to the million cash paid for the partnership acquisition net of cash acquired 
we also invested million in for the construction in progress for our piedmont biomass project 
cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to cash flows provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  we acquired a equity interest in idaho wind for million and approximately million in transaction costs

we invested million for the construction in progress for our piedmont biomass project 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted in a net inflow of million compared to a net inflow of million for the same period in the change from the prior year is primarily attributable to million in net proceeds from our issuance of senior notes in november and million in net proceeds from our equity offering in october to fund a portion of the cash portion of the partnership acquisition 
in  we also received proceeds of million of project level debt related to our piedmont biomass construction

we completed our common share conversion in november as a result  cdn million million of subordinated notes were extinguished and our entire monthly distribution to shareholders is now paid in the form of a dividend as opposed to the monthly distribution being split between a subordinated notes interest payment and a common share dividend during the year ended december  cash available for distribution prior to our conversion to a common share structure  holders of our ipss received monthly cash distributions in the form of interest payments on subordinated notes and dividends on common shares 
subsequent to the conversion  holders of common shares received the same monthly cash distributions of cdn per year in the form of a dividend on the new common shares 
the dividend was increased to cdn in november the payout ratio was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the payout ratio of for the year ended december  is close to the range we had expected prior to the acquisition of the partnership and includes approximately two months of combined results 
the increase in the payout ratios from through was anticipated 
we expect a material decline in the payout ratio due to a number of factors including a full year s impact of the partnership acquisition  increases in cash flow from our legacy portfolio of projects such as selkirk whose project level debt will be repaid by mid year and chambers where we expect a resolution of the dispute with the host over electrical pricing  a one time realized gain from the termination of foreign currency forwards based on combined entities aggregate position  and the lower final termination payment from our prior management agreement with an arclight affiliate

project level debt the following table summarizes the maturities of project level debt 
the amounts represent our share of the non recourse project level debt balances at december  and exclude any purchase accounting adjustments recorded to adjust the debt to its fair value at the time the project was acquired

for projects that are consolidated  our share of these amounts is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   restricted cash at the consolidated projects totaled million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for the projects are generally made at the project level using project cash flows and project reserves 
therefore  the distributions that we receive from the projects are made net of capital expenditures needed at the projects 
the projects which we own consist of large capital assets that have established commercial operations 
ongoing capital expenditures for assets of this nature are generally not significant because most major expenditures relate to planned repairs and maintenance and are expensed when incurred 

table of contents in  several of our projects will conduct scheduled outages to complete major maintenance work 
the level of maintenance and capital expenditures for our legacy portfolio of projects will be consistent with prior years 
however  overall maintenance and capital expenditures will be higher than in due to our acquisition of the partnership project portfolio 
during the fourth quarter of the level of maintenance was substantial and capital expenditures were minimal which is customary 
a planned outage occurred at nipigon and unplanned outages occurred at north island and oxnard in the fourth quarter 
in july  chambers was offline due to a forced outage associated with a leak in its steam turbine 
the project completed repairs in july and despite the outage  by maintaining a high availability factor earned its full capacity payment 
cadillac conducted its scheduled fall outage in september that consisted of equipment inspections and minor boiler repairs 
the maintenance outage was completed on time and slightly under budget 
cadillac s outage of six days will not impact its availability requirement under the project s ppa 
north island underwent an outage to refurbish part of its gas turbine and oxnard s outage was related to a lubrication system repair 
nipigon s gas turbine was removed for maintenance 
at each of north island  oxnard and nipigon  the facility s gas turbine was removed and replaced with a lease engine  pursuant to a lease agreement with ge  in order to minimize the plant s downtime

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that changes in market prices  such as foreign exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices  will affect our cash flows or the value of our holdings of financial instruments 
the objective of market risk management is to minimize the impact that market risks have on our cash flows as described in the following paragraphs 
our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in fuel commodity prices  currency exchange rates or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in fuel commodity prices  currency exchange rates or interest rates and the timing of transactions 
fuel commodity market risk our current and future cash flows are impacted by changes in electricity  natural gas and coal prices 
the combination of long term energy sales and fuel purchase agreements is generally designed to mitigate the impacts to cash flows of changes in commodity prices by passing through changes in fuel prices to the buyer of the energy

we also entered into natural gas swaps to effectively fix the price of million mmbtu of future natural gas purchases representing approximately of our share of the expected natural gas purchases at the project during and we expect cash distributions from orlando to increase significantly following the expiration of the project s gas contract at the end of because both projected natural gas prices at that time and the prices in the natural gas swaps we have executed are lower than the price of natural gas being purchased under the project s gas contract

coal prices used in the energy revenue component of the projected distributions from the lake and auburndale projects incorporate a forecast of the applicable crystal river facility coal cost provided by the utility based on their internal projections

the following table summarizes the hedge position related to natural gas needed to meet ppa requirements at lake and auburndale as of december  and february  portion of gas volumes currently hedged lake contracted financially hedged total auburndale contracted financially hedged total average price of financially hedged volumes per mmbtu lake auburndale foreign currency exchange risk we use foreign currency forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates  as many of our projects generate cash flow in us dollars but we pay dividends to shareholders and interest on corporate level long term debt and on convertible debentures predominantly in canadian dollars 
we have a hedging strategy for the purpose of mitigating the currency risk impact on the long term sustainability of dividends to shareholders 
we have executed this strategy utilizing cash flows from our projects that generate canadian dollars and by entering into forward contracts to purchase canadian dollars at a fixed rate to hedge approximately of our expected dividend  long term debt and convertible debenture interest payments through changes in the fair value of the forward contracts partially offset foreign exchange gain or losses on the us dollar equivalent of our canadian dollar obligations 
at december   the forward contracts consist of monthly purchases through the end of of cdn million at an exchange rate of cdn per us dollar and contracts assumed in our acquisition of the partnership with various expiration dates through december to purchase a total of cdn million at an average exchange rate of cdn per us dollar 
it is our intention to periodically consider extending or terminating the length of these forward contracts 

table of contents on january   we terminated various foreign currency forward contracts with expiration dates through december assumed in our acquisition of the partnership resulting in a realized gain of million 
the foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices and the estimation of the counter party s credit risk 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recorded in foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
the following table contains the components of recorded foreign exchange gain loss for the years ended december   and year ended december  unrealized foreign exchange gain loss convertible debentures forward contracts and other realized foreign exchange loss gains on forward contract settlements the following table illustrates the impact on the fair value of our financial instruments of a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar as of december  canadian dollar denominated debt  at carrying value foreign currency forward contracts interest rate risk changes in interest rates do not have a significant impact on cash payments that are required on our debt instruments as approximately of our debt  including our share of the project level debt associated with equity investments in affiliates  either bears interest at fixed rates or is financially hedged through the use of interest rate swaps 
we have executed an interest rate swap at our consolidated auburndale project to economically fix a portion of its exposure to changes in interest rates related to the variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted interest payments under the project level auburndale debt 
the interest rate swap was executed in november and expires on november  we have an interest rate swap at our consolidated cadillac project to economically fix a portion of its exposure to changes in interest rates related to the variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge of the forecasted interest payments under the project level cadillac debt 
the interest rate swap expires on june  we executed two interest rate swaps at our consolidated piedmont project to economically fix its exposure to changes in interest rates related to its variable rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreements are not designated as hedges and changes in their fair market value are recorded in the statements of operations 
the interest rate swaps were executed on october  and november  and expire on february  and november   respectively 

table of contents in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 
after considering the impact of interest rate swaps  a hypothetical change in the average interest rate of basis points would change annual interest costs  including interest at equity investments  by approximately million
