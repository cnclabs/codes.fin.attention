overview we are a leading regional provider of wireless communications services to consumers and businesses primarily in virginia and west virginia 
our primary services are wireless digital personal communications services pcs 
our pcs operations are composed of an ntelos branded retail subscriber business and a wholesale business which primarily relates to an exclusive contract with sprint 
we believe our regional focus  contiguous service area  and leveraged use of our network via our wholesale contract with sprint provide us with a differentiated competitive position relative to our primary wireless competitors  most of whom are national providers 
our pcs revenues accounted for virtually all of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   our retail pcs business had approximately  ntelos retail subscribers  representing a penetration of our total covered population 
as of december    approximately of our total cell sites contain evolution data optimized revision a ev do technology  which provides us with the technical ability to support high speed mobile wireless data services 
we have an agreement with sprint spectrum lp to act as their exclusive wholesale provider of network services through july  under this arrangement  which we refer to as the strategic network alliance  we are the exclusive pcs service provider in our western virginia and west virginia service area to sprint for all sprint cdma wireless customers 
for the years ended december  and  we realized total wholesale revenues of million and million  respectively 
of these totals for the years ended december  and  million of total revenue and million  respectively  related to the strategic network alliance 
following a contractual travel data rate reset on july   our monthly calculated revenue from sprint under this contract fell below the million minimum and thus we billed and recognized revenue at the million minimum stipulated in the contract from the july travel data rate reset through september  revenues from this contract exceeded the monthly minimum during the fourth quarter of and during all of due to the growth of sprint s subscribers in our territory and increased data usage driven in part by an increased penetration of smartphones 
if sprint were to lose subscribers in our territory or take steps  such as throttling data usage or changing its data pricing structure  our revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  there are automatic rate resets in the agreement  the provisions of which could  and do  come into question from time to time 
in the event we believe any rate resets to be erroneous  we may dispute such resets in accordance with the procedures set forth in the agreement 
we have disputed the data rate resets for the fourth quarter of  which remain unresolved as of december  the final outcome of this unresolved disputed item is unknown at this time  however  the company does not believe that the final outcome will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenues from our ntelos branded retail business have declined each of the past two years driven by declines in both the number of subscribers served and the average monthly revenue per handset unit in service arpu 
gross additions in are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by the weak economic environment and the relative attractiveness of our competitors phones  pricing plans  coverage and technology offerings 
at the same time  these competitive factors could continue to cause our churn to remain high and may make it difficult for us to add net subscribers in these same competitive and economic factors may also continue to put downward pressure on our arpu into to increase gross additions and to better serve and retain our customers  we are focused on refining our distribution strategy with respect to both prepay and postpay sales 
we continued expansion of our indirect distribution channel using master agents and exclusive dealers and increasing the points of distribution and the quality of the indirect 
table of contents locations 
during we also made significant improvements to our direct distribution channel with changes in the number of stores  store locations and upgrades to our stores in appearance and customer service functionality 
we believe these changes will improve our postpay sales and also bolster prepay sales productivity 
similar to other wireless competitors  we have also increased focus on data services  including smartphone and data card devices 
the percentage of sales of smartphones and data cards increased to approximately of total postpay sales during  as compared to approximately in in april  we revised our postpay rate plan offerings to include two unlimited smartphones for 
these plans  which represented of total postpay adds since april  are expected to favorably impact deactivation rates in we continue to face risks to our competitive value position in the postpay market through reduced price nationwide unlimited voice plans  text and data plans by competitors such as at t  verizon wireless  sprint  t mobile and us cellular 
we expect postpay competition to continue to be intense as the market exceeds saturation and carriers focus on taking market share from competitors 
we also expect the increased competition with prepaid products to remain intense as competitors have targeted this segment as a means to sustain growth and increase market share 
competition in the wireless prepay market has continued to evolve 
a number of large wireless competitors  including boost and virgin mobile operated by sprint  tracfone s straight talk service  t mobile  net and page plus  have been actively competing in the prepaid market over the last three years 
many of these competitors have access to big box retailers and convenience stores that are unavailable to us 
pricing competition in the prepaid market continues to intensify  as the price for unlimited voice  text and data drops below to remain competitive with our prepaid product offerings  we offer the frawg wireless product 
frawg wireless is a simple  low cost service that has a minimum number of plans  offers attractive features and provides regional or national unlimited coverage 
this no contract offer requires a higher retail price on the handset in exchange for a variety of plans featuring competitive price points 
acquisition costs are substantially lower than postpay with a reduced handset subsidy and lower selling and advertising costs 
in february  we repriced frawg wireless plans to include all taxes and fees in the base price of our plans to improve the customer experience through simplicity 
in june  we refined our prepaid strategic focus to target the higher end of the prepaid market  by offering unlimited talk  text and data for 
table of contents arpu discussion to supplement our financial statements presented under generally accepted accounting principles gaap throughout this document we reference non gaap measures  such as arpu to measure operating performance for which our operating managers are responsible and upon which we evaluate their performance 
arpu is a wireless telecommunications industry metric that measures service revenues per period divided by the weighted average number of handsets in service during that period 
arpu as defined below may not be similar to arpu measures of other wireless companies  is not a measurement under gaap and should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the information contained in our consolidated statements of operations 
we closely monitor the effects of new rate plans and service offerings on arpu in order to determine their effectiveness 
we believe arpu provides management useful information concerning the appeal of our wireless rate plans and service offerings and our performance in attracting and retaining high value customers 
the table below provides a reconciliation of operating revenue to subscriber revenues used to calculate average monthly arpu for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands  other than average monthly arpu data operating revenues less equipment revenues from sales to new customers less equipment revenues from sales to existing customers less wholesale  other adjustments retail subscriber revenues average number of subscribers total average monthly arpu retail subscriber revenues less voice and other features revenues retail subscriber data revenues average number of subscribers total data average monthly arpu arpu declined each of the past two years reflecting a drop in voice apru  partially offset with an increase in data arpu 
voice arpu may continue to decline in due to competitive pressures and economic conditions 
however  we anticipate data arpu will continue to grow and offset a substantial portion of the decline in voice arpu 
our wireless network upgrade to ev do and increased sales of data driven devices such as smartphones has helped increase retail data arpu by for the year ended december  over the year ended december  operating revenues our revenues are generated from the following categories retail revenue  consisting of subscriber revenues from network access  data services  feature services and equipment revenues  and wholesale and other revenues  primarily wholesale revenue from the strategic network alliance and roaming revenue from other carriers 
our wholesale revenues derived from the strategic network alliance are primarily from voice and data usage by sprint and sprint affiliate customers who live in the strategic network alliance service area home subscribers and those customers of sprint who use our network for voice and data services while traveling through the strategic network alliance service area travel subscribers 
other revenues related to paging and revenue from leasing excess building space 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses are incurred from the following categories cost of sales and services  including digital pcs handset equipment costs which  in keeping with industry practice  particularly with handsets sold with service contracts  we sell to our customers at a price below our cost  and usage based access charges  including long distance  roaming charges  and other direct costs incurred in accessing other telecommunications providers networks in order to provide telecommunication services to our end user customers  leased facility expenses for connection to other carriers networks  cell sites and switch locations and engineering and repairs and maintenance expenses related to property  plant and equipment  customer operations expenses  including marketing  product management  product advertising  selling  billing  customer care  directory services  customer retention and bad debt expenses  corporate operations expenses  including taxes other than income  executive  accounting  legal  purchasing  information technology  human resources and other general and administrative expenses  including earned bonuses and equity based compensation expense related to stock and option instruments held by certain members of corporate management and expenses related to acquisitions and the business separation  depreciation and amortization  including depreciable long lived property  plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets where applicable  and accretion of asset retirement obligations aro

the decrease in retail revenue of million consisted of a million decrease in subscriber revenues partially offset by a million  or  increase in equipment revenues 
retail revenue subscriber service revenues reflected a net subscriber loss of approximately  subscribers  or  from an average of approximately  subscribers during to an average of approximately  subscribers during during the second half of  we introduced several initiatives to increase subscriber net additions  including improved targeting of high value  long term customers  as a result  net subscriber losses were less than in the fourth quarter of voice and other feature revenues  excluding data revenues  were lower in than in by million due to a number of factors  including the decrease in the subscriber base and a decline in arpu for these services due to competitive pricing reductions and economic conditions 
partially offsetting the decrease in voice revenue was an increase in data revenue of million compared to underlying this growth in data revenue was the technology upgrade to ev do and an increased sales emphasis on smartphones and other data centric handsets coupled with a broader array of data packages  leading to a near tripling of the customer base with smartphones  from as of december   to as of december  wholesale and other revenue wholesale and roaming revenues from the strategic network alliance increased million  or  from this increase reflects increased data usage  measured in megabytes  which grew year over year  as the use of smartphones and data devices proliferated as well as an increase in sprint subscribers in our territory

this increase reflected increased cost of sales and services tied to higher equipment costs and higher network costs  coupled with higher customer operations costs tied to higher retention  bad debt and advertising expenses 
in addition  we incurred higher corporate costs primarily related to the business separation and higher depreciation charges as we continue to invest in the network and support infrastructure 
cost of sales and services cost of sales and services increased million  or  from to this increase was primarily due to a million increase in equipment costs reflecting a mix of higher cost devices sold 
smartphones and data devices represented and of sales in and  respectively 
given the continued increase in smartphone penetration and the introduction of more technologically advanced and expensive handsets  we expect handset costs to continue to rise in the increase in cost of sales and services also reflected an increase in cell site and network access costs of million over primarily related to an increase in the number of cell sites as of december  and additional access connectivity to support high speed data over the ev do network and increased data usage 
we expect that these network costs will continue to increase in as we continue to build new cell sites and increase our network capacity to handle the continued increase in data traffic 
these increased costs in were partially offset by a decrease in roaming costs of million as a result of in network roaming savings associated with continued cell site expansion and the ability to direct more traffic to our lowest cost partners 
customer operations expenses customer operations expenses increased million  or  from to retention costs increased million  driven by customer retention credits and increased costs for device exchanges and upgrades to higher cost smartphones 
third party agent commissions increased million due to an increase in sales through this channel and higher payouts for promotional plans and data features 
as part of our promotional efforts to reduce churn  we may continue to incur higher handset subsidies  rebates  commissions and other retention expenses for existing customers in bad debt expense increased million as more subscriber accounts were disconnected for non payment during and the average unpaid balance increased

critical accounting policies and estimates the fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities 
to aid in that understanding  management has identified our critical accounting policies for discussion herein 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which are continuous in nature 
principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  ntelos inc and all of its wholly owned subsidiaries and those limited liability corporations where ntelos inc or certain of its subsidiaries  as managing member  exercises control 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
revenue recognition policies the company recognizes revenue when services are rendered or when products are delivered and functional  as applicable 
certain services of the company require payment in advance of service performance 
in such cases  the company records a service liability at the time of billing and subsequently recognizes revenue ratably over the service period 
the company bills customers certain transactional taxes on service revenues 
these transactional taxes are not included in reported revenues as they are recognized as liabilities at the time customers are billed 
the company earns revenue by providing access to and usage of its networks 
airtime revenues are recognized as services are provided 
wholesale revenues are earned by providing switched access and other switched and dedicated services  including wireless roamer management  to other carriers 
revenues for equipment sales are recognized at the point of sale 
pcs handset equipment sold with service contracts are generally sold at prices below cost  based on the terms of the service contracts 
the company recognizes the entire cost of the handsets at the time of sale 
the company evaluates related transactions to determine whether they should be viewed as multiple deliverable arrangements  which impact revenue recognition 
multiple deliverable arrangements are presumed to be bundled transactions and the total consideration is measured and allocated to the separate units based on their relative selling 
table of contents price with certain limitations 
the company has determined that sales of handsets with service contracts related to these sales generated from company owned retail stores are multiple deliverable arrangements 
accordingly  substantially all of the nonrefundable activation fee revenues as well as the associated direct costs are allocated to the wireless handset and are recognized at the time of the sale based on the fact that the handsets are generally sold below cost and on the relative selling price evaluation 
however  revenue and certain associated direct costs for activations sold at third party retail locations are deferred and amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship as the company is not a principal in the transaction to sell the handset and therefore any activation fees charged are fully attributable to the service revenues 
nonrefundable activation fee revenue are not associated with multiple deliverable arrangements but are directly associated with the underlying service being provided over the applicable coverage period 
in all cases  the direct activation costs exceed the related activation revenues 
when deferral is appropriate  the company defers these direct activation costs up to but not in excess of the related deferred revenue 
the company recognizes revenue in the period that it is able to estimate the amount and when the collection of such amount is considered probable 
trade accounts receivable the company sells its services to residential and commercial end users and to other communication carriers primarily in virginia  west virginia and parts of maryland  north carolina  pennsylvania  ohio and kentucky 
the company has credit and collection policies to maximize collection of trade receivables and requires deposits on certain sales 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical results  current and expected trends and changes in credit policies 
management believes the allowance adequately covers all anticipated losses with respect to trade receivables 
actual credit losses could differ from such estimates 
the company includes bad debt expense in customer operations expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
inventories and supplies the company s inventories and supplies consist primarily of items held for resale such as pcs handsets and accessories 
the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
market value is determined by reviewing current replacement cost  marketability and obsolescence 
long lived asset recovery long lived assets include property  plant and equipment  radio spectrum licenses  long term deferred charges  goodwill and intangible assets to be held and used 
long lived assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are recorded at cost and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount should be evaluated pursuant to the subsequent measurement guidance described in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc impairment is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment charge 
the company believes that no impairment exist as of december  depreciation of property  plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which the company reviews and updates based on historical experiences and future expectations 
buildings are depreciated over a year life and leasehold improvements  which are categorized in land and buildings  are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the remaining lease terms 
network plant and equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years  with a weighted average life of approximately years 
furniture  fixtures and other equipment are depreciated over various lives from to years 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and radio spectrum licenses are considered indefinite lived intangible assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are instead tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event indicates that the asset might be impaired 
the company assesses the recoverability of indefinite lived assets annually on october and whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 

table of contents the company uses a two step process to test for goodwill impairment 
step one requires a determination of the fair value of each of the reporting units and  to the extent that this fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value including goodwill  the step two calculation of implied fair value of goodwill is not required and no impairment loss is recognized 
in testing for goodwill impairment  the company utilizes a combination of valuation models and an analysis which allocates enterprise value to the reporting units 
the company s annual testing is performed as of october of each year 
the radio spectrum licenses relate primarily to pcs licenses in service in the markets that we serve 
the company considers a number of valuation methods  including market based and the greenfield cash flow method  in its impairment testing for these assets 
pension benefits and retirement benefits other than pensions ntelos inc sponsors a non contributory defined benefit pension plan pension plan covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements and were employed by ntelos inc prior to october  the pension plan was closed to ntelos inc employees hired on or after october  pension benefits vest after five years of plan service and are based on years of service and an average of the five highest consecutive years of compensation subject to certain reductions if the employee retires before reaching age and elects to receive the benefit prior to age sections and of the internal revenue code and erisa sections and establish minimum funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans 
the minimum required contribution is generally equal to the target normal cost plus the shortfall amortization installments for the current plan year and each of the six preceding plan years less any calculated credit balance 
if plan assets less calculated credits are equal to or exceed the funding target  the minimum required contribution is the target normal cost reduced by the excess funding  but not below zero 
the company s policy is to make contributions to stay at or above the threshold required in order to prevent benefit restrictions and related additional notice requirements and is intended to provide not only for benefits based on service to date  but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
also  ntelos inc has nonqualified pension plans that are accounted for similar to its pension plan 
ntelos inc provides certain health care and life benefits for retired employees that meet eligibility requirements 
the company has two qualified nonpension postretirement benefit plans 
the health care plan is contributory  with participants contributions adjusted annually 
the life insurance plan is also contributory 
these obligations  along with all of the pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans  are ntelos inc obligations assumed by the company 
eligibility for the life insurance plan is restricted to active pension participants age as of january  neither plan is eligible to employees hired after april the accounting for the plans anticipates that the company will maintain a consistent level of cost sharing for the benefits with the retirees 
the company s share of the projected costs of benefits that will be paid after retirement is generally being accrued by charges to expense over the eligible employees service periods to the dates they are fully eligible for benefits 
ntelos inc also sponsors a contributory defined contribution plan under internal revenue code section k for substantially all employees 
the company s policy is to match of each participant s annual contributions for contributions up to of each participant s annual compensation and of each participant s annual contributions up to an additional of each participant s annual compensation 
company contributions vest after two years of service 
effective june   the company began funding its k matching contributions in shares of the company s common stock 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and income tax expense  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
asu no 
was 
table of contents issued concurrently with ifrs  fair value measurement  to provide largely identical guidance about fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the new standards do not extend the use of fair value but  rather  provide guidance on how fair value should be applied where it already is required or permitted under ifrs or us gaap 
for us gaap  most of the changes are clarifications of existing guidance or wording changes to align with ifrs the company is required to apply this asu prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  early adoption is not permitted 
in the period of adoption  a reporting entity will be required to disclose a change  if any  in valuation technique and related inputs that result from applying the asu and to quantify the total effect  if practicable 
we do not expect application of this asu to have a significant impact on our financial statements and disclosure for the first quarter of in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu increases the prominence of other comprehensive income in financial statements 
under this asu  an entity will have the option to present the components of net income and comprehensive income in either one or two consecutive financial statements 
the asu eliminates the option in us gaap to present other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
an entity should apply this asu retrospectively 
this asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
the company will apply the requirements of this asu to its financial statements for the fiscal year beginning january  in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu permits an entity to make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if an entity concludes it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  it need not perform the two step impairment test 
the asu is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will apply the requirements of this asu to our goodwill impairment testing beginning with the fiscal year beginning january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks primarily related to interest rates

this facility bears interest at above either the eurodollar rate or  whichever is greater  or above either the federal funds rate or  whichever is greater 
we have other fixed rate  long term debt in the form of capital leases totaling million as of december  we have a million interest rate cap agreement which is used to manage our exposure to interest rate market risks and to comply with the terms and conditions of the ntelos inc senior secured credit facility 
this cap agreement helps minimize our exposure to interest rate movements by capping libor at 
we have interest rate risk on borrowings under the term loans in excess of the million covered by the cap agreement million at december  
the cap agreement ends in august at december   our financial assets included cash of million 
other securities and investments totaled million at december
