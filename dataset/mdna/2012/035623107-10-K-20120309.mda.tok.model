item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
management overview during fiscal  we made meaningful progress on our strategic initiatives  while generating significant increases in both sales and profitability 
we delivered on our commitments to drive significant improvement at loft stores  invest in and grow our e commerce channels at both brands  and drive further profitable growth through our real estate strategy  including further roll out of our more productive ann taylor new store format and the accelerated expansion of loft outlet 
we also succeeded in managing our product costs by implementing sourcing strategies that resulted in flat year over year product costs  despite inflation in commodity and labor costs 
our efforts in these areas helped us realize a substantial  double digit percentage improvement in sales  net income and diluted earnings per share in fiscal we experienced profitable sales growth at loft stores and in our e commerce and factory outlet channels at both brands  with total net sales increasing to billion  and comparable sales up 
this  combined with the success of our sourcing cost mitigation strategies  contributed to a gross margin rate of for the fiscal year 
in addition  our focus on continued expense management across the company further benefited our bottom line results  with net income increasing  to million  in fiscal stronger net income  combined with our fiscal share repurchase activity  also resulted in a increase in earnings per diluted share to  up from in fiscal 
table of contents at the ann taylor brand  comparable sales increased 
by channel  results were mixed 
at ann taylor stores  comparable sales decreased  due to merchandise assortments that did not fully reflect our clients desire for fashion and for a greater breadth of product at opening and lower price points  particularly in the back half of the year 
this decrease in comparable sales performance was more than offset by strong comparable sales growth of in the e commerce channel and solid growth of in the ann taylor factory channel 
due to a higher promotional stance and lower full price selling in the ann taylor stores channel  gross margin rate for the ann taylor brand was under pressure  particularly towards the end of the fiscal year 
looking ahead to fiscal  we are focused on evolving the in store assortment to offer a better balance within each category  offering more depth in key fashion items and a greater breadth of the assortment at opening price points 
in addition  we remain focused on creating a more engaging and personalized in store experience for our client 
the loft brand achieved strong results in fiscal  building solid momentum as the year progressed  as we continued to focus on delivering our client feminine  casual  high quality fashion at great value 
our merchandise assortments were well received across all channels of the brand  including loft stores  loft 
com and loft outlet  resulting in an increase in comparable sales for the brand overall 
by channel  loft stores delivered a comparable sales increase  driven by compelling fashion and balanced merchandise assortments 
strong product offerings also benefited comparable sales at loft 
com and loft outlet  which increased and  respectively 
gross margin was also strong in a highly competitive environment  as we were able to reduce total in store promotions  primarily offering planned promotions in key categories 
looking forward  we believe that the brand is well positioned to continue to drive profitable growth in all channels in fiscal throughout the year  we remained committed to enhancing shareholder value and maintaining a healthy balance sheet and cash position 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock  representing nearly of outstanding shares  at a cost of million  and closed the year with million in cash and no bank debt 
we also continued to closely manage our inventory levels throughout the year and ended the year with total inventory per square foot down as compared to the prior year  excluding e commerce 
our fiscal real estate strategy was focused on supporting our brands objectives  while continuing to enhance the overall productivity and profitability of our fleet through the roll out of new format stores at ann taylor and new loft stores  an accelerated factory outlet expansion  as well as continued execution of selective store closures 
at the ann taylor brand  we opened new format stores and converted or downsized an additional existing stores into the new format 
looking ahead  we expect to open an additional of these stores in fiscal together with the existing new format stores  these expected openings will represent nearly one third of the ann taylor store fleet 
these stores  which are significantly smaller than the fleet average  deliver a higher level of sales productivity and profitability as compared to the balance of the ann taylor stores chain 
in addition  we opened seven ann taylor factory stores and closed three ann taylor stores during fiscal at loft  we continued to move forward with the expansion of our loft brand store fleet  opening loft stores and closing of our older  underperforming loft stores during the year 
we also successfully executed the accelerated opening of loft outlet locations in fiscal overall  our businesses experienced substantial growth in both sales and profitability during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
looking ahead  our focus in fiscal is to strengthen our connection to our client 
with two strong brands  we intend to be there for her wherever and whenever she chooses to shop by offering great fashion  service  quality  value and personalization along with an engaging client experience across all of our channels 
the launch of our new e commerce platform last summer was a critical first step on the pathway to implementing a multi channel shopping experience  which we expect to launch in the latter part of fiscal in addition  we plan to expand our brands internationally  by first adding international shipping capabilities in our e commerce channels  followed by our planned entry into canada in late or early

gross margin is the difference between net sales and cost of sales  which is comprised of direct inventory costs for merchandise sold  including all costs to transport merchandise from third party suppliers to our distribution center 
buying and occupancy costs are excluded from cost of sales 
operating income because retailers do not uniformly record supply chain costs as a component of cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses  operating income allows us to benchmark our performance relative to other retailers 
operating income represents earnings before interest and income taxes and measures our earnings power from ongoing operations 
store productivity store productivity  including sales per square foot  average unit retail price aur  units per transaction upt  dollars per transaction dpt  traffic and conversion  is evaluated by management in assessing our operating performance 
inventory turnover inventory turnover measures our ability to sell our merchandise and how many times it is replaced over time

table of contents total net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales increasing 
full price sell through increased over last year at both brands  with significant increases in the loft stores channel 
both brands experienced comparable sales gains for the year  with significant double digit comparable sales percentage growth at our online stores and at loft outlet 
by brand  ann taylor s net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales increasing 
the brand s fiscal results were impacted by a miss in the print and novelty components of the ann taylor stores channel merchandise assortment in late spring and a merchandise mix during the fall season that lacked depth in fashion and did not offer enough choices at opening price points 
although traffic remained steady across all channels  we were more promotional than planned in the ann taylor stores channel  particularly during the back half of the year 
this resulted in lower aurs and dpts and contributed to a decrease in comparable sales 
at anntaylor 
com  we experienced significant top line growth over last year  with comparable sales increasing  driven by increases in traffic  conversion and average order value 
sales at ann taylor factory stores were also up  reflecting a increase in comparable sales and the addition of seven new stores 
at the loft brand  net sales increased million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  with comparable sales up 
loft s full year results reflected client acceptance of the brand s feminine  casual fashion and value proposition  particularly in the loft stores channel  where comparable sales increased 
the brand also experienced higher levels of full price sell through  as well as year over year increases in dpts and upts 
loft also experienced strong top line growth at loft 
com  reflecting increases in traffic  conversion  and average order value 
in addition  sales at loft outlet increased significantly as a result of a increase in comparable sales and our accelerated spring expansion in this channel 
total net sales increased approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal with comparable sales increasing 
by brand  ann taylor s net sales increased approximately million  or in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as comparable sales increased 
the ann taylor brand experienced a significant increase in dpts during fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to the impact of higher aurs driven by less promotional activity across all channels  and across merchandise categories  particularly in suits  dresses  pants  and skirts 
at the loft brand  net sales increased million  or  in fiscal as compared with fiscal  as comparable sales increased 
overall  the loft brand experienced a slight increase in dpts during fiscal compared to fiscal due to slightly higher aurs 
however  sales at the loft stores channel were down slightly due to a merchandise assortment that lacked an appropriate balance between fashion and key items 
our net sales do not show significant seasonal variation 
as a result  we have not had significant overhead and other costs generally associated with large seasonal variations 
cost of sales and gross margin because retailers do not uniformly record supply chain costs as cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses  our gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to certain other retailers 
for additional information regarding costs classified in cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses  on our consolidated statements of operations  refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table presents cost of sales and gross margin in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands cost of sales gross margin percentage of net sales gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal  down from in fiscal at ann taylor  full price sell through was negatively impacted by a miss in the print and novelty components in our spring merchandise assortment at ann taylor stores  as well as a lack of depth in fashion and breadth at opening price points in the back half of the year 
this  combined with the highly promotional retail environment we faced late in the year  also impacted the brand s overall gross margin rate performance 
at loft  strong client acceptance of the brand s merchandise offering contributed to higher levels of full price sell through in the loft stores channel  which also drove higher gross margin rate performance 
loft was also able to maintain its planned promotional strategy despite the highly competitive retail environment 

table of contents the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily the result of higher full price sell through and higher margin rates achieved on non full price sales at the ann taylor brand due to an improved merchandise assortment and effective marketing strategy  partially offset by slightly lower margin rates at the loft brand  due to a higher level of promotional activity at the loft stores channel 
overall  our gross margin performance also benefited from our strategy to appropriately position and manage inventory levels at both brands 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table presents selling  general and administrative expenses in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased approximately million compared with fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher payroll and occupancy costs associated with our store growth  primarily in the factory outlet channel  an overall increase in variable costs related to higher net sales  an increase in marketing spend and costs associated with the management realignment at ann taylor 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in performance based compensation expense 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to fixed cost leveraging as a result of higher net sales  restructuring program savings and our continued focus on expense management 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased approximately million compared with fiscal  primarily reflecting higher marketing and performance based compensation costs and an increase in variable costs related to higher sales  partially offset by payroll  benefits and tenancy related savings associated with our restructuring program and other cost savings initiatives

in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded million and million  respectively  in restructuring charges 
there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal additional costs associated with store closings included in our restructuring program are expected to be immaterial 
see liquidity and capital resources for further discussion 
asset impairment charges during fiscal  we recorded million in non cash store asset impairment charges related to stores that we expect to continue operating  based on projected undiscounted future cash flows 
these non cash store asset impairment charges were calculated using certain assumptions  including estimates related to future sales growth and gross margin rates 
no such charges were recorded in fiscal or fiscal 
table of contents depreciation and amortization the following table presents depreciation and amortization expense in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands depreciation and amortization percentage of net sales the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal was driven by prior year accelerated depreciation recognized in connection with both our restructuring program in fiscal and the replacement of our internet platform in early fiscal  partially offset by an increase in the average store count over the two year period 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal was due to lower average capital balances in fiscal as compared with fiscal  driven by a reduction in the average store count over the two year period and the impact of asset impairment charges and accelerated depreciation recognized in connection with our restructuring program 
interest income the following table presents interest income in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands interest income percentage of net sales interest income decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal largely due to the impact of lower gains recorded in connection with our deferred compensation plan

interest expense the following table presents interest expense in dollars and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands interest expense percentage of net sales interest expense includes various charges  the largest of which are interest and fees related to our credit facility 
there was no significant change in interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the fact that there were no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at any time during fiscal in march  we accessed million from our credit facility as a precaution against potential disruption in the credit markets 
in july  we repaid million of these revolver borrowings  and  in october  we repaid the remaining million

table of contents income taxes the following table presents our income tax provision benefit and effective income tax rate fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings in various state taxing jurisdictions and certain other discrete items

our primary ongoing cash requirements relate to the purchase of inventory and property and equipment 
the following table sets forth certain measures of our liquidity fiscal year ended january  january  january  dollars in thousands cash provided by operating activities working capital current ratio operating activities cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to higher net income adjusted for non cash expenses  changes in long term compensation and prepaid expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable driven by higher sales and reductions in current compensation related accruals 
merchandise inventories increased approximately million  or  in fiscal from fiscal reflecting both comparable sales increases as well as our increase in the number of stores 
however  merchandise inventory on a per square foot basis  excluding online store inventory  remained flat at approximately at the end of fiscal and fiscal inventory turned times in fiscal compared with times in fiscal investing activities cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used for investing activities in fiscal was primarily related to capital expenditures associated with new store openings  store refurbishment projects and investments in technology

other at january   substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents were invested in deposit accounts at fdic insured banks 
all of our deposit account balances are currently fdic insured and will remain so through december  as a result of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a multi year  strategic restructuring program designed to enhance profitability and improve overall operating effectiveness 
this program was subsequently expanded during the third quarter of fiscal and again during the second quarter of fiscal the three key elements of our restructuring program included closing underperforming stores  an organizational streamlining that reduced our corporate and field staffing levels  and a broad based productivity initiative that included  among other things  centralized procurement of non merchandise goods and services  outsourcing certain activities and optimizing store productivity and effectiveness 
by fiscal  our restructuring program enabled us to realize total ongoing annualized savings of approximately million  of which approximately million was first realized in fiscal and million was first realized in fiscal total pre tax expenses associated with our restructuring initiatives were million  of which million were non cash expenses  primarily associated with the write down of assets related to store closures  and million were cash charges for severance and various other costs 
in fiscal  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recorded million  million  million and million  respectively  in restructuring charges 
there were no restructuring charges recorded during fiscal  and any additional costs associated with store closings beyond fiscal are expected to be immaterial 
we have a credit card program which offers eligible clients the choice of a private label or co branded credit card 
all new cardholders are automatically enrolled in our exclusive rewards program  which is designed to recognize and promote client loyalty 
we provide the sponsoring bank with marketing support of the program  and use our sales force to process credit card applications for both the private label and co branded credit cards 
as part of the program  which began in october and has a six and one half year term  we received an upfront signing bonus from the sponsoring bank 
we also receive ongoing payments for new accounts activated  as well as a share of finance charges collected by the sponsoring bank 
these revenue streams are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and accordingly are recognized as revenue ratably based on the total projected revenues over the term of the agreement 

table of contents certain judgments and estimates underlie our projected revenues and related expenses under the program  including projected future store counts  the number of applications processed  our projected sales growth and points breakage  among other things 
during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we recognized approximately million  million and million of revenue related to the credit card program  respectively 
at january   january  and january   approximately million  million and million  respectively  of deferred credit card income is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
partially offsetting the income from the credit card program are costs  net of points breakage  related to the customer loyalty program

in  we acquired the registered trademark in the prc for the ann taylor mark the mark in the apparel and footwear class pursuant to a trademark assignment agreement  which assignment was subject to approval by the prc trademark office 
until that approval was received  our existing trademark license agreement permitting our use of the mark remained in effect 
the assignment of the mark was approved by the prc trademark office in october and is subject to renewal with the prc trademark office every years 
the costs of renewal are immaterial  and we intend to renew the mark indefinitely 
we have recognized the full million purchase price of the mark  of which million remains payable under the assignment agreement  as an indefinite lived intangible asset included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the mark is subject to annual impairment testing which is performed during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  unless there is an indicator of impairment  which would require an interim impairment review 
the most recent impairment test supported the carrying value of the mark and did not result in an impairment charge 
on october   we froze our non contributory defined benefit pension plan the pension plan 
as a result of the freeze  only those associates who were eligible under the pension plan on or before september  substantially all associates of the company who completed  hours of service during a consecutive month period prior to that date are eligible to receive benefits from the pension plan once they have completed the five years of service required to become fully vested 
no associate may become a participant in the pension plan on or after october  and no additional benefits have been earned under the pension plan since october  our funding obligations and liability under the terms of the pension plan are determined using certain actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate and an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for pension benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
the discount rate selected was based on a yield curve which uses expected cash flows from the pension plan and then discounts those cash flows with the bond rate for that period 
this resulted in a discount rate of 
a one percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension expense for fiscal by million and would increase the liability for pension benefits at january  by million 
a one percent increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease total net periodic pension expense for fiscal by million and would decrease the liability for pension benefits at january  by million 
pension plan assets as of january  were allocated in equities  and in bond related funds 
for the purposes of developing long term rates of return  it was assumed that the short term investments were reallocated to equities and bond related funds  yielding assumed long term rates of return of and  respectively 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  we considered the historical returns and the future expectations for returns for each asset class  as well as the target asset allocation of the pension portfolio 
a lower expected rate of return on pension plan assets would increase pension expense 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a one percent change in the long term rate of return assumption would impact fiscal pension expense by approximately million 
our pension plan assets experienced gains in fiscal and fiscal as a result  pension costs in fiscal were million lower than pension costs in fiscal and pension costs in fiscal were million lower than pension costs in fiscal  excluding settlement charges 
as a result of a lower discount rate and a lower expected rate of return  the latter of which is consistent with changes in the underlying asset allocation of the pension plan  pension expense for fiscal  excluding any potential settlement charges  is projected to be approximately million  or million higher than pension expense  excluding settlement charges  in fiscal our pension plan is invested in readily liquid investments  primarily equity and debt securities 
although we were not required to make a contribution to the pension plan in fiscal or fiscal  any deterioration in the financial markets or changes in discount rates may require us to make a contribution to our pension plan in fiscal 
table of contents since the total amount of lump sum payments made to plan participants was less than the interest component of pension expense during fiscal  no non cash settlement charges were recorded 
during fiscal  the total amount of lump sum payments made to plan participants exceeded the interest cost  resulting in a non cash settlement charge of million  which was included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are self insured for expenses related to our employee point of service medical plan  our workers compensation plan  general liability plan and for short term and long term disability  up to certain thresholds 
claims filed  as well as claims incurred but not reported  are accrued based on management s estimates  using information received from plan administrators  third party actuaries  historical analysis and other relevant data 
we believe we have taken reasonable steps to ensure that we are adequately accrued for incurred costs related to these programs at january  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
based on the above  we have determined that our most critical accounting policies are those related to merchandise inventory valuation  asset impairment  income taxes and stock and incentive based compensation 
these policies are also discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in relevant sections of this discussion and analysis 
merchandise inventory valuation merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  at the individual item level 
market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value  which is generally the merchandise selling price 
merchandise inventory levels are monitored to identify slow moving items and broken assortments items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes and markdowns are used to clear such merchandise 
merchandise inventory value is reduced if the selling price is marked below cost 
physical inventory counts are performed annually in january and estimates are made for any shortage between the date of the physical inventory count and the balance sheet date 

table of contents asset impairment long lived tangible assets are accounted for under asc  property  plant  and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed periodically for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net asset balances through future cash flows is in question 
management estimates future pre tax cash flows at the store level undiscounted and without interest charges based on historical experience  knowledge and market data 
estimates of future cash flows require that we make assumptions and apply judgment  including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets 
these estimates can be affected by factors such as future store results  real estate demand  and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict  as well as other factors such as those outlined in risk factors 
if the expected future cash flows related to the long lived assets are less than the assets carrying value  an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations 
no valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets  since we anticipate that the full amount of these assets will be realized in the future 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future earnings  taxable income  and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various taxing jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax 
we are currently under examination by the us federal  and certain state and local taxing jurisdictions 
further  at any given time  multiple tax years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
the recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon examination  changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates 
while no adjustments to recorded amounts are anticipated  a variance in our effective tax rate would affect net income after taxes by approximately million in fiscal stock and incentive based compensation the calculation of stock based compensation expense requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the stock based awards  stock price volatility and pre vesting forfeitures 
we estimate the expected life of shares granted in connection with stock based awards using historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on an average of our historical volatility and the implied volatility of publicly traded options on our common stock  if the latter is available 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of stock based awards granted  exercised and cancelled  as well as future expected behavior 
similarly  the calculation of long term performance compensation expense related to our restricted cash program rcp requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected forfeiture of earned and banked awards and forecasts of our future income growth 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical rcp forfeiture patterns  as well as current and future trends of expected behavior 
we estimate future income growth based on past performance  future business trends and new business initiatives 
the assumptions used to calculate the fair value of stock based awards and long term performance compensation expense represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we were to use different assumptions  the expense recorded could be materially different 
for stock based awards  if we were to adjust our forfeiture rate estimates by  the impact to stock based compensation cost would be approximately million 
similarly  if we were to adjust rcp forfeiture rate estimates by  the impact to long term incentive compensation expense would be approximately million 
finally  if we were to adjust the interest rate factors applied to amounts banked under the rcp by  the impact to long term incentive compensation expense would be approximately million
