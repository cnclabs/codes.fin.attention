customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity  reducing operating costs  enhancing capital efficiency  and decreasing working capital requirements 
our software incorporates our proprietary empirical models of manufacturing and planning processes and reflects the deep domain expertise we have amassed from focusing on solutions for the process industries for over years 
we have developed our applications to design and optimize processes across three principal business areas engineering  manufacturing and supply chain 
we are a recognized market and technology leader in providing process optimization software for each of these business areas 
we have established sustainable competitive advantages within our industry based on the following strengths innovative products that can enhance our customers profitability  long term customer relationships  large installed base of users of our software  and long term license contracts with historically high renewal rates we have more than  customers globally 
our customers include manufacturers in process industries such as energy  chemicals  pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  power  metals and mining  pulp and paper  and biofuels  as well as engineering and construction firms that help design and build process manufacturing plants 
industry background the process industries consist of companies that typically manufacture finished products by applying a controlled chemical process either to a raw material that is fed continuously through the plant or to a specific batch of raw material 
the process industries include energy  chemicals  pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  power  metals and mining  pulp and paper  and biofuels as well as engineering and construction firms that design and build process manufacturing plants 
page 
table of contents process manufacturing is often complex because small changes in the feedstocks used  or to the chemical process applied  can have a significant impact on the efficiency and cost effectiveness of manufacturing operations 
as a result  process manufacturers  as well as the engineering and construction firms that partner with these manufacturers  have extensive technical requirements and need sophisticated  integrated software to help design  operate and manage their complex manufacturing environments 
the unique characteristics associated with process manufacturing create special demands for business applications that frequently exceed the capabilities of generic software applications or non process manufacturing software packages 
industry specific challenges facing the process industries companies in different process industries face specific challenges that are driving the need for software solutions that design  operate and manage manufacturing environments more effectively energy 
our energy markets are comprised of three primary sectors refining and marketing  also called downstream  exploration and production  also called upstream  and gas processing  also called midstream companies engaged in refining and marketing convert crude oil through a chemical manufacturing process into end products such as gasoline  jet and diesel fuels and into intermediate products for downstream chemical manufacturing companies 
these companies are characterized by high volumes and low operating margins 
in order to deliver better margins  they focus on optimizing feedstock selection and product mix  maximizing throughput  and minimizing inventory  all while operating safely and in accordance with regulations 
companies engaged in exploration and production explore for and produce hydrocarbons 
they target reserves in increasingly diverse geographies involving greater geological  logistical and political challenges 
they need to design and develop ever larger  more complex and more remote production  gathering and processing facilities as quickly as possible with the objective of optimizing production and ensuring regulatory compliance 
companies engaged in gas processing gather natural gas from well heads  clean it  process it and separate it into dry natural gas and natural gas liquids in preparation for transport to downstream markets 
the number of gas processing plants in north america has increased significantly in recent years to process gas extracted from shale deposits 
chemicals 
the chemicals industry includes both bulk and specialty chemical companies bulk chemical producers  which manufacture commodity chemicals  compete primarily on price  are seeking to achieve economies of scale and manage operating margin pressure by building larger  more complex plants located near feedstock sources 
specialty chemical manufacturers  which primarily manufacture highly differentiated customer specific products  face challenges in managing diverse product lines  multiple plants and complex supply chains 
engineering and construction 
engineering and construction firms must compete on a global basis in bidding on and executing complex  large scale projects 
they need a digital environment in which optimal plant designs can be produced quickly and efficiently  incorporating highly accurate cost estimation technology 
in addition  these projects require software that enables significant collaboration internally  with the manufacturer  and in many cases  with other engineering and construction firms 
similarly  companies in the pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  power  metals and mining  pulp and paper  and biofuels industries are seeking process optimization solutions that help them deliver improved financial and operating results in the face of varied process manufacturing challenges 
page 
table of contents increasing complexity of the process industries companies in the process industries constantly face pressure on margins  which results in their continually seeking ways to operate more efficiently 
at the same time  these manufacturers have to battle growing complexity as a result of the following industry trends globalization of markets 
process manufacturers are expanding their operations beyond mature geographic markets in order to take advantage of growing demand and available feedstocks in emerging markets such as china  india  russia  latin america and the middle east 
process manufacturers must be able to design  build and operate plants in emerging markets efficiently and economically 
they also need to improve efficiency and reduce costs at their existing plants in mature markets in order to compete with new plants in emerging markets 
volatile markets 
process manufacturers must react quickly to frequent changes in feedstock prices  temporary or longer term feedstock shortages  and rapid changes in finished product prices 
unpredictable commodity markets strain the manufacturing and supply chain operations of process manufacturers  which must consider  and when appropriate implement  changes in inventory levels  feedstock inputs  equipment usage and operational processes in order to remain competitive 
environmental and safety regulations 
process companies must comply with an expanding array of data maintenance and reporting requirements under governmental and regulatory mandates  and the global nature of their operations can subject them to numerous regulatory regimes 
these companies often face heightened scrutiny and oversight because of the environmental  safety and other implications of their products and manufacturing processes 
these companies increasingly are relying upon software applications to model potential outcomes  store operating data and develop reporting capabilities 
market opportunity technology solutions historically have played a major role in helping companies in the process industries improve their manufacturing productivity 
in the s  process manufacturers implemented distributed control systems  or dcs  to automate the management of plant hardware 
dcs use computer hardware  communication networks and industrial instruments to measure  record and automatically control process variables 
in the s  these manufacturers adopted enterprise resource planning  or erp  systems to streamline back office functions and interact with dcs 
this allowed process manufacturers to track  monitor and report the performance of each plant  rather than relying on traditional paper and generic word processing spreadsheets 
many process manufacturers have implemented both dcs and erp systems but have realized that their investments in hardware and back office systems are inadequate 
a dcs is only able to control and monitor processes based on fixed sets of parameters and cannot dynamically react to changes in the manufacturing process unless instructed by end users 
erp systems can only record what is produced in operations 
although dcs and erp systems help manage manufacturing performance  neither of these systems can optimize what is produced  how it is produced or where it is produced 
moreover  neither can help a process manufacturer understand how to improve its processes or how to identify opportunities to decrease operating expenses 
process optimization software addresses the gap between dcs and erp systems 
this software focuses on optimizing the manufacturing process itself how the process is run and the economics of that process 
by connecting dcs and erp systems with intelligent  dynamic applications  process optimization software allows a manufacturer to make better  faster economic decisions 
this software can optimize a manufacturing environment by  for example  incorporating process manufacturing domain knowledge  supporting real time decision making  and providing the ability to forecast and simulate potential actions 
furthermore  these solutions can optimize the supply chain by helping a manufacturer to understand the operating conditions in each plant  which enables a manufacturer to decide where best to manufacture products 
based on information and reports from arc advisory group pet  cpm and rpo  scp  the market for engineering  manufacturing and supply chain process optimization software and services for the major markets that we serve was approximately billion in more specifically  based on this information  we estimate that page 
table of contents the total engineering market for all vertical industries was approximately million in and is expected to grow at approximately annually through  the manufacturing market addressing the energy  chemicals and pharmaceuticals verticals was approximately billion in and is expected to grow at approximately annually through  and the supply chain market addressing the energy  chemicals and pharmaceutical verticals was approximately million in and is expected to grow at annually through aspenone solutions we provide integrated process optimization software solutions designed and developed specifically for the process industries

flexible commercial model 
our aspenone licensing model provides a customer with access to all of the applications within the aspenone suite s the customer licenses  including the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenone software suite 
the customer can change or alternate the use of multiple applications in a licensed suite through the use of exchangeable units of measurement  or tokens  licensed in quantities determined by the customer 
this enables the customer to use those applications whenever required and to experiment with different applications to best solve whatever critical business challenges the customer faces 
the customer can easily increase their usage of our software as their business requirements evolve 
page 
table of contents hardware independent technology 
our software can be easily integrated and used with equipment manufactured by any major process manufacturing hardware vendor 
because of our hardware independent approach  customers can use our software solutions to create a unified view of their operations  even if their plants use hardware from different vendors 
our competitive strengths we believe our key competitive advantages include  in addition to the comprehensive breadth of our integrated software solutions and the flexibility of our aspenone licensing model  the following market leadership 
we are a leader in each of the markets addressed by our software 
based on information presented in reports issued by arc advisory group relating to performance in our core industries  we ranked in the market addressed by our engineering software  in the market addressed by our manufacturing software  and in the market addressed by our supply chain software 
industry leading innovation based on substantial process expertise 
over the past years  our significant investment in research and development has led to a number of major process engineering advances considered to be industry standard applications 
since our founding  we have built a highly specialized development organization comprised of not only traditional software engineers but also chemical engineers 
this approach provides us with substantial process industry expertise  as our developers have critical know how that allows us to address the specific challenges of our customers 
rapid  high return on investment 
many customers purchase our software because they believe it will provide rapid  demonstrable and significant returns on their investment and increase their profitability 
for some customers  cost reductions in the first year following installation have exceeded the total cost of our software 
for many customers  even a relatively small improvement in productivity can generate substantial recurring benefits due to the large production volumes and limited profit margins typical in process industries 
in addition  our solutions can generate organizational efficiencies and operational improvements that can further increase a process company s profitability 
growth strategy our objective is to further establish and extend our position as a leading global provider of process optimization software and related services to the process industries 
we intend to build upon our market and technology leadership position by pursuing the following continue to provide innovative  market leading solutions 
we have pioneered a number of industry standard and award winning software applications 
for example  aspenplus  our process modeling tool for the chemicals industry  has won the chemical processing magazine readers choice award for process simulation software for the last eight years 
we have been recognized by r d magazine for innovation in out of the box modeling capabilities that we developed with the national institute of standards and technology 
our recent innovations include applications for mobile devices  search and collaboration  electrolyte and biofuel characterizations  and methodologies for carbon management 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development in order to develop and offer new and enhanced solutions for our aspenone suites 
further penetrate existing customer base 
we have an installed base of over  customers  but many customers do not use all of our products 
as we transition these customers to our aspenone licensing model  we will seek to identify ways in which they can improve their business processes by using the entire licensed suite of aspenone applications  both at an individual user level and across all of their plant locations 
expand presence in emerging markets 
companies in the process industries are expanding their operations to take advantage of growing demand and available feedstocks in less mature markets such as china  india  russia  latin america and the middle east 
additionally  process manufacturers with existing plants in these markets are beginning to recognize the value of upgrading their operations to take advantage of process optimization solutions 
we historically have derived a significant portion of our total revenue from outside of north america  and we believe we can further extend our international presence by penetrating emerging markets 
page 
table of contents extend vertical reach and indirect sales channel 
we have historically focused on the energy  chemicals  and engineering and construction industries 
we intend to expand beyond our core vertical industries  in part by further developing our indirect channel 
we are expanding our relationships with third party resellers that have a presence in certain non core verticals such as power  consumer packaged goods  pharmaceuticals  pulp and paper  metals and mining  and biofuels 
we believe these relationships will enable us to reach companies in additional process industries cost effectively and to leverage our indirect channel partners market experience and domain expertise in those industries 
products our integrated process optimization software solutions are designed and developed specifically for the process industries 
customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity  reducing operating costs  enhancing capital efficiency  and decreasing working capital requirements 
we have designed and developed our software applications across three principal business areas engineering 
our engineering software applications are used during both the design and the ongoing operation of plant facilities to model and improve the way engineers develop and deploy manufacturing assets 
process manufacturers must address a variety of challenges including design  operational improvement  collaborative engineering and economic evaluation 
they must  for example  determine where they should locate facilities  how they can lower manufacturing costs  what they should produce and how they can maximize plant efficiency 
manufacturing 
our manufacturing software products focus on optimizing day to day processing activities  enabling customers to make better  faster decisions that lead to improved plant performance and operating results 
these solutions include desktop and server applications that help customers make real time decisions  which can reduce fixed and variable costs and improve product yields 
process manufacturers must address a wide range of manufacturing challenges such as optimizing execution efficiency  reducing costs  selecting the right raw materials  scheduling and coordinating production processes  and identifying an appropriate balance between turnaround times  delivery schedules  cost and inventory 
supply chain management 
our supply chain management solutions include desktop and server applications that help customers optimize critical supply chain decisions in order to reduce inventory  increase asset efficiency  and respond more quickly to changing market conditions 
process manufacturers must address numerous challenges as they strive to effectively and efficiently manage raw materials inventory  production schedules and feedstock purchasing decisions 
supply chain managers face these challenges in an environment of ever changing market prices  supply constraints and customer demands 
our software applications are organized into two suites aspenone engineering and aspenone manufacturing and supply chain 
these suites are integrated applications that allow end users to utilize common data models to design process manufacturing environments  forecast and simulate potential actions  monitor operational performance  and manage planning and scheduling activities 
the two suites are designed around core modules and applications that allow customers to design  manage and operate their process manufacturing environments  as shown below aspenone engineering business area aspenone module major products product description engineering engineering aspen plus process modeling software for conceptual design  optimization and performance monitoring for the chemicals industry aspen hysys process modeling software for conceptual design  optimization and performance monitoring for the energy industry aspen exchanger design and rating software used to design  simulate and optimize the performance of heat exchangers aspen economic evaluation economic evaluation software for estimating costs of conceptual process designs aspen basic engineering workflow tool that allows engineers to build  re use and share process models and data page

table of contents business segments we have three operating segments license  sms  training  and other  and professional services 
our chief operating decision maker  the president and chief executive officer  assesses financial performance and allocates resources based upon the three lines of business 
for further information of our operating segments  see note  segment and geographic information  to our consolidated financial statements  included in item exhibits and financial statement schedules of this form k 
sales and marketing we employ a value based sales approach  offering our customers a comprehensive suite of software and services that enhance the efficiency and productivity of their engineering  manufacturing and supply chain operations 
we have increasingly focused on selling our products as a strategic investment for our customers and therefore devote an increasing portion of our sales efforts at senior management levels  including senior decision makers in manufacturing  operations and technology 
our aspenone solution strategy supports this value based approach by broadening the scope of optimization across the entire enterprise and expanding the use of process models in the operations environment 
in particular  we offer a variety of training programs focused on illustrating the capabilities of our applications as well as online training built into our applications 
we have implemented incentive compensation programs for our sales force that reward efforts that increase customer usage of our products 
in july  we introduced our aspenone licensing model under which customers receive access to all of the applications within the aspenone suite s they license  including the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenone software suite 
this affords customers the ability to use our software whenever required and to experiment with different applications to best solve whatever critical business challenges they face 
customers can easily increase their usage of our software as their business requirements evolve 
we believe our aspenone licensing model will further enable our sales force to develop consultative sales relationships with our customers 
historically  most of our license sales have been generated through our direct sales force 
in order to market the specific functionality and other technical features of our software  our account managers work with specialized teams of technical sales personnel and product specialists organized for each sales and marketing effort 
our technical sales personnel typically have degrees in chemical engineering or related disciplines and actively consult with a customer s plant engineers 
product specialists share their detailed knowledge of the specific features of our software solutions as they apply to the unique business processes of different vertical industries 
in addition  we have a limited number of global account managers  each of whom is focused on a specific global account 
our overall sales force  which consists of sales account managers  technical sales personnel  indirect channel personnel  inside sales personnel  and marketing personnel  consisted of employees as of june  we supplement our direct sales efforts with a variety of marketing initiatives  including industry analyst and public relations activities  campaigns to promote awareness  user group meetings and customer relationship programs 
we have established reseller relationships with select companies that we believe can help us increase sales in specific regions and non core target markets 
we also license our software products to universities that agree to use our products in teaching and research 
we believe that students familiarity with our products will stimulate future demand once the students enter the workplace 
competition our markets in general are competitive  and we expect the intensity of competition in our markets to increase as existing competitors enhance and expand their product and service offerings and as new participants enter the market 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
some of our customers and companies with which we have strategic relationships also are  or may become  competitors 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources than we have 
as a result  these companies may be able to offer lower prices  additional products or services  or other incentives that we cannot match or offer 
these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns 
we believe they also have adopted and may continue to pursue more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers  employees and strategic partners 
for example  some competitors may be able to initiate relationships through sales and installations of hardware and then seek to expand their customer relationships by offering process optimization software at a discount 
page 
table of contents in addition  competitors with greater financial resources may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products 
our primary competitors differ among our principal product areas our engineering software competes with products of businesses such as abb ltd  honeywell international  inc  invensys plc and kbc advanced technologies plc 
our manufacturing software competes with products of companies such as abb ltd  honeywell international  inc  invensys plc  osisoft  inc  rockwell automation  inc  siemens ag and yokogawa electric corporation 
our supply chain management software competes with products of companies such as jda software group  inc  oracle corporation and sap ag 
in addition  we face challenges in selling our solutions to large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions 
we believe our key competitive differentiator is the profitability improvement that our software and services provide for our customers 
we seek to develop and offer integrated suites of targeted  high value vertical industry solutions that can be implemented with relatively limited service requirements 
we believe this approach provides us with an advantage over many of our competitors that offer software products that are point solutions or are more service based 
the principal competitive factors in our industry also include breadth  depth and integration of software offerings  domain expertise of sales and service personnel  consistent global support  performance and reliability  price  and time to market 
key license agreements honeywell we acquired hyprotech ltd 
and related subsidiaries of aea technology plc in may the federal trade commission alleged in an administrative complaint filed in august that this acquisition was improperly anticompetitive 
in december  we entered into a consent decree with the ftc to resolve the matter 
in connection with the consent decree  we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a purchase and sale agreement with honeywell international inc and certain of its subsidiaries  pursuant to which we sold intellectual property and other assets to honeywell relating to our operator training business and our hyprotech engineering software products 
under the terms of the transactions we retained a perpetual  irrevocable  worldwide  royalty free non exclusive license with the limited rights to sublicense to the hyprotech engineering software and have the right to continue to develop and sell the hyprotech engineering products  and we retained certain agreements with third parties other than customers or distributors for hysys and related products 
page 
table of contents we are subject to ongoing compliance obligations under the ftc consent decree 
under a modification order that became final in august  we are required to continue to provide the ability for users to save input variable case data for aspen hysys and aspen hysys dynamics software in a standard portable format  which will make it easier for users to transfer case data from later versions of the products to earlier versions 
we also must provide documentation to honeywell of the aspen hysys and aspen hysys dynamics input variables  as well as documentation of the covered heat exchange products 
these requirements will apply to all existing and future versions of the covered products released prior to december  or december   at the option of honeywell 
in addition  we provided to honeywell a license to modify and distribute in object code form certain versions of our flare system analyzer software 
there is no assurance that the actions required by the ftc s modified order and related settlement with honeywell will not provide honeywell with additional competitive advantages that could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
massachusetts institute of technology in march  we entered into a system license agreement with the massachusetts institute of technology 
pursuant to this agreement  mit granted us a perpetual license to a program that provides a framework for simulating the steady state behavior of chemical processes that we utilize in the simulation engine of our aspenplus software product 
the license provides that we own any derivative works and enhancements of the licensed program that we create 
the license is fully paid up  and will continue in effect unless terminated for specified cause 
sublicenses granted to our customers would not be affected by any such termination 
intellectual property our software is proprietary 
our strategy is to rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions  and to rely on license and confidentiality agreements and software security measures to further protect our proprietary technology and brand 
the laws of many countries in which our products are licensed may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property  but generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property 
as of june   we owned patents issued in the united states and had patent applications pending in the united states and foreign counterparts 
we conduct business under our trademarks and use trademarks on some of our products 
we believe that having distinctive marks may be an important factor in marketing our products 
we have registered or applied to register some of our significant trademarks in the united states and in selected other countries 
although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks  the laws of many countries protect trademarks solely on the basis of registration and we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration 
we actively monitor use of our trademarks and have enforced  and will continue to enforce  our rights to our trademarks 
we rely on trade secrets to protect certain of our technology 
we generally seek to protect these trade secrets by entering into non disclosure agreements with our employees and customers  and historically have restricted access to our software and source code  which we regard as proprietary information 
in certain cases  we have provided copies of code to customers for the purpose of special product customization or have deposited the source code with a third party escrow agent as security for ongoing service and license obligations 
in these cases  we rely on non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
trade secrets may be difficult to protect  and it is possible that parties may breach their confidentiality agreements with us 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our technology or independent development by others of technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
any misappropriation of our technology or development of competitive technologies could harm our business 
we could incur substantial costs in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
third parties have asserted  and may assert in the future  claims that our products infringe patents or patent applications under which we do not hold licenses or other rights 
third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad 
these third parties have brought  and could in the future bring  claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successfully asserted against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we could be forced to stop or delay manufacturing or sales of the product that is the subject of the suit before or after the suit is decided on the merits 
in addition  we could be forced to redesign a product that uses an allegedly infringing technology 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial and may require significant commitments of time by our management 
page 
table of contents we believe that the success of our business depends more on the quality of our proprietary software products  technology  processes and know how than on trademarks  copyrights or patents 
while we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable  we do not believe that our competitive position in the industry is dependent simply on obtaining legal protection for our software products and technology 
instead  we believe that the success of our business depends primarily on our ability to maintain a leadership position by developing proprietary software products  technology  information  processes and know how 
nevertheless  we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights with respect to our products and development processes through trademark  copyright and patent registrations  both foreign and domestic  whenever appropriate as part of our ongoing research and development activities

risks related to our business if we fail to develop new software products  enhance existing products and services  or penetrate new vertical markets  we will be unable to implement our growth strategy successfully and our business could be seriously harmed 
the maintenance and extension of our market leadership and our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new software products that achieve market acceptance with acceptable operating margins 
enterprises are requiring their application software vendors to provide greater levels of functionality and broader product offerings 
we must continue to enhance our current product line and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with increasingly sophisticated customer requirements and the technological developments of our competitors 
our business and operating results could suffer if we cannot successfully respond to the technological advances of competitors  or if our new products or product enhancements and services do not achieve market acceptance 
we have implemented a product strategy that unifies our software solutions under the aspenone brand with differentiated aspenone vertical solutions targeted at specific process industry segments 
we cannot ensure that our product strategy will result in products that will continue to meet market needs and achieve significant market acceptance 
if we fail to introduce new products that meet the demands of our customers or our target markets  or if we fail to penetrate new vertical markets in the process industries  our operating results and cash flows from operations will grow at a slower rate than we anticipate and our financial condition could suffer 
our business could suffer if the demand for  or usage of  our aspenone software declines for any reason  including declines due to adverse changes in the process industries 
our aspenone suites account for a significant majority of our revenue and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
if demand for  or usage of  our software declines for any reason  our operating results  cash flows from operations and financial position would suffer 
our business could be adversely affected by any decline in demand for or usage of our aspenone suites  the introduction of products and technologies that serve as a replacement or substitute for  or represent an improvement over  our aspenone suites  technological innovations that our aspenone suites do not address  and our inability to release enhanced versions of our aspenone suites on a timely basis 
adverse changes in the process industries that lead to reductions  postponements or cancellations of customer purchases of our products and services 
because of the nature of their products and manufacturing processes and their global operations  companies in the process industries are subject to risk of adverse or even catastrophic environmental  safety and health accidents or incidents and are often subject to changing standards and regulations worldwide 
in addition  in the past  worldwide economic downturns and pricing pressures experienced by energy  chemical  pharmaceutical and other process industries have led to consolidations and reorganizations 
any such adverse environmental  safety or health incident  change in regulatory standards  or economic downturn that affects the process industries  as well as general domestic and foreign economic conditions and other factors that reduce spending by companies in these industries  could harm our operating results in the future 
page 
table of contents unfavorable economic and market conditions or a lessening demand in the market for process optimization software could adversely affect our operating results 
our business is influenced by a range of factors that are beyond our control and difficult or impossible to predict 
if the market for process optimization software grows more slowly than we anticipate  demand for our products and services could decline and our operating results could be impaired 
further  the state of the global economy may deteriorate in the future 
our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable global economic and market conditions as well as a lessening demand for process optimization software generally 
customer demand for our products is linked to the strength of the global economy 
if weakness in the global economy persists  many customers may delay or reduce technology purchases 
this could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition or reduced use of our products by our customers 
we will lose revenue if demand for our products is reduced because potential customers experience weak or deteriorating economic conditions  catastrophic environmental or other events  and our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow from operations would likely be adversely affected 
the majority of our revenue is attributable to operations outside the united states  and our operating results therefore may be materially affected by the economic  political  regulatory and other risks of foreign operations 
as of june   we operated in countries 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force located throughout the world 
in the event that we are unable to adequately staff and maintain our foreign operations  we could face difficulties managing our international operations 
customers outside the united states accounted for the majority of our total revenue in fiscal and in fiscal we anticipate that revenue from customers outside the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
our operations outside the united states are subject to additional risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  less effective protection of intellectual property  requirements of foreign laws and other governmental controls  difficulties and delays in translating products and product documentation into languages other than english  difficulties and delays in negotiating software licenses compliant with accounting revenue recognition requirements in the united states  difficulties in collecting trade accounts receivable in other countries  adverse tax consequences  and the challenges of managing legal disputes in foreign jurisdictions 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported revenue and operating results 
in fiscal  of our total revenue was denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses incurred outside the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our reported revenue and operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency risk arises primarily from the net difference between non us dollar receipts from customers outside the united states and non us dollar operating expenses for subsidiaries in foreign countries 
currently  our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates exist primarily with the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar and japanese yen against the us dollar 
since late fiscal  we have not entered into derivative financial instruments  such as forward currency exchange contracts  intended to manage the volatility of these market risks 
we cannot predict the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  and foreign currency fluctuations in the future may adversely affect our revenue and operating results 
any hedging policies we may implement in the future may not be successful  and the cost of those hedging techniques may have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
page 
table of contents competition from software offered by current competitors and new market entrants  as well as from internally developed solutions by our customers  could adversely affect our ability to sell our software products and related services and could result in pressure to price our products in a manner that reduces our margins 
our markets in general are competitive and differ among our principal product areas engineering  manufacturing  and supply chain management 
our engineering software competes with products of businesses such as abb ltd  honeywell international  inc  invensys plc and kbc advanced technologies plc 
our manufacturing software competes with products of companies such as abb ltd  honeywell international  inc  invensys plc  osisoft  inc  rockwell automation  inc  siemens ag and yokogawa electric corporation 
our supply chain management software competes with products of companies such as jda software group  inc  oracle corporation and sap ag 
in addition  we face challenges in selling our solutions to large companies in the process industries that have internally developed their own proprietary software solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing  service and other resources than we have 
as a result  these companies may be able to offer lower prices  additional products or services  or other incentives that we cannot match or offer 
these competitors may be in a stronger position to respond more quickly to new technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns 
we believe they also have adopted and may continue to pursue more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers  employees and strategic partners 
for example  some competitors may be able to initiate relationships through sales and installations of hardware and then seek to expand their customer relationships by offering process optimization software at a discount 
in addition  many of our competitors have established  and may in the future continue to establish  cooperative relationships with third parties to improve their product offerings and to increase the availability of their products in the marketplace 
competitors with greater financial resources may make strategic acquisitions to increase their ability to gain market share or improve the quality or marketability of their products 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional software products and related services on terms favorable to us 
businesses may continue to enhance their internally developed solutions  rather than investing in commercial software such as ours 
our current and potential commercial competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
in addition  if these competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality to our products  we may need to decrease the prices for our products in order to remain competitive 
if we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures  our margins will be reduced and our operating results will be negatively affected 
we cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
defects or errors in our software products could harm our reputation  impair our ability to sell our products and result in significant costs to us 
our software products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors 
we have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date  but we have from time to time found defects in our products and we may discover additional defects in the future 
we may not be able to detect and correct defects or errors before releasing products 
consequently  we or our customers may discover defects or errors after our products have been implemented 
we have in the past issued  and may in the future need to issue  corrective releases of our products to remedy defects or errors 
the occurrence of any defects or errors could result in lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  delays in payment to us by customers  product returns  injury to our reputation  diversion of our resources  increased service and warranty expenses or financial concessions  increased insurance costs  and legal claims  including product liability claims 
defects and errors in our software products could result in claims for substantial damages against us 
page 
table of contents we may be subject to significant expenses and damages because of pending liability claims and other claims related to our products and services 
the sale and implementation of certain of our software products and services  particularly in the areas of advanced process control and supply chain management  entail the risk of product liability claims and associated damages 
our software products and services are often integrated with our customers networks and software applications and are used in the design  operation and management of manufacturing and supply chain processes at large facilities  often for mission critical applications 
any errors  defects  performance problems or other failures of our software could result in significant liability to us for damages or for violations of environmental  safety and other laws and regulations 
our software products and implementation services could give rise to warranty and other claims 
in the ordinary course of business  we are from time to time involved in lawsuits or claims relating to our products or services 
these matters include an april claim by a customer for approximately million that certain of our software products and implementation services failed to meet the customer s expectations 
we are unable to determine whether resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations  or  in many cases  reasonably estimate the amount of the loss  if any  that may result from the resolution of these matters 
our agreements with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
it is possible  however  that the limitation of liability provisions in our agreements may not be effective as a result of federal  foreign  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
a substantial product liability judgment against us could materially and adversely harm our operating results and financial condition 
even if our software is not at fault  a product liability claim brought against us could be time consuming  costly to defend and harmful to our operations and reputation 
if we fail to comply or are deemed to have failed to comply with our ongoing federal trade commission  or ftc  consent decree  our business may suffer 
in december  we entered into a consent decree with the ftc with respect to a civil administrative complaint filed by the ftc in august alleging that our acquisition of hyprotech ltd 
and related subsidiaries of aea technology plc in may was anticompetitive in violation of section of the federal trade commission act and section of the clayton act 
in july  we announced that the ftc closed an investigation relating to the alleged violations of the decree  and issued an order modifying the consent decree  which became final in august we are subject to ongoing compliance obligations under the ftc consent decree 
there is no assurance that the actions required by the ftc s modified order and related settlement with honeywell international  inc will not require significant attention and resources of management  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  if we fail to comply  or are deemed to have failed to comply  with such consent decree  our business may suffer 
third party claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others may be costly to defend or settle and could damage our business 
we cannot be certain that our software and services do not infringe issued patents  copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the software industry  and we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees concerning their use of our software products and integration technologies and services 
third parties may bring claims of infringement against us 
because our software is integrated with our customers networks and business processes  as well as other software applications  third parties may bring claims of infringement against us  as well as our customers and other software suppliers  if the cause of the alleged infringement cannot easily be determined 
page 
table of contents claims of alleged infringement may have a material adverse effect on our business and may discourage potential customers from doing business with us on acceptable terms  if at all 
defending against claims of infringement may be time consuming and may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including our management s attention to our business 
furthermore  a party making an infringement claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our software or require that we re engineer some or all of our products 
claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to enter costly royalty or license agreements 
we may be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be harmed significantly if any of these events occurred  and the price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
furthermore  former employers of our current and future employees may assert that our employees have improperly disclosed confidential or proprietary information to us 
in addition  we have agreed  and may agree in the future  to indemnify certain of our customers against claims that our software infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others 
although we carry general liability insurance  our current insurance coverage may not apply to  and likely would not protect us from  liability that may be imposed under any of the types of claims described above 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share 
our software is proprietary 
our strategy is to rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws in the united states and other jurisdictions  and to rely on license and confidentiality agreements and software security measures to further protect our proprietary technology and brand 
we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property  but generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting our intellectual property 
we have registered or applied to register some of our trademarks in the united states and in selected other countries 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and customers  and historically have restricted third party access to our software and source code  which we regard as proprietary information 
in certain cases  we have provided copies of source code to customers for the purpose of special product customization or have deposited copies of the source code with a third party escrow agent as security for ongoing service and license obligations 
in these cases  we rely on non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of our technology or independent development by others of technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged  invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain  renew or enter into new licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
any misappropriation of our technology or development of competitive technologies could harm our business and could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our proprietary technology  and could subject us to substantial costs in protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights  including costs of proceedings we have instituted to enforce our intellectual property rights  such as those described in item other proceedings  and or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services 
the laws of some countries in which our products are licensed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
moreover  in some non us countries  laws affecting intellectual property rights are uncertain in their application  which can affect the scope of enforceability of our intellectual property rights 
our ability to raise capital in the future may be limited  and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our business plan 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
we may need to obtain additional financing thereafter or earlier  however  if our current plans and projections prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flows prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of lower than expected revenue  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance  the quality of our receivables  and the availability of capital in the credit markets 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or other investments 
page 
table of contents risks related to our common stock our common stock may experience substantial price and volume fluctuations 
the equity markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly in the high technology sector  and those fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in addition  factors such our aspenone licensing model  our financial performance  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  and market conditions in the computer software or hardware industries  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
this type of litigation against us could result in substantial liability and costs and divert management s attention and resources 
our corporate documents and provisions of delaware law may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders may consider desirable 
section of the delaware general corporation law  our charter and our by laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
these provisions include limitations on the removal of directors  a classified board of directors  so that not all members of the board are elected at one time  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  the ability of the board to make  alter or repeal our by laws  and the ability of the board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval 
these provisions could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or a change in our management that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial  discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions  and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

business overview we are a leading global provider of mission critical process optimization software solutions which are designed to manage and optimize plant and process design  operational performance  and supply chain planning 
our aspenone software and related services have been developed specifically for companies in the process industries  including the energy  chemicals  and engineering and construction industries 
customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity  reducing operating costs  enhancing capital efficiency  and decreasing working capital requirements 
our software incorporates our proprietary empirical models of manufacturing and planning processes and reflects the deep domain expertise we have amassed from focusing on solutions for the process industries for over years 
we have developed our applications to design and optimize processes across three principal business areas engineering  manufacturing and supply chain 
we are a recognized market and technology leader in providing process optimization software for each of these business areas 
we have established sustainable competitive advantages within our industry based on the following strengths innovative products that can enhance our customers profitability  long term customer relationships  large installed base of users of our software  and long term license contracts with historically high renewal rates page 
table of contents we have more than  customers globally 
our customers include manufacturers in process industries such as energy  chemicals  pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  power  metals and mining  pulp and paper  and biofuels  as well as engineering and construction firms that help design and build process manufacturing plants 
we primarily license our aspenone products through a subscription offering 
our aspenone products are organized into two suites engineering and manufacturing and supply chain msc 
the aspenone licensing model provides customers with access to all of the products within the aspenone suite s they license 
customers can change or alternate the use of multiple products in a licensed suite through the use of exchangeable units of measurement  or tokens  licensed in quantities determined by the customer 
this licensing system enables customers to use products as needed and to experiment with different products to best solve whatever critical business challenges they face 
customers can increase their usage of our software by purchasing additional tokens as business needs evolve 
we believe easier access to all of the aspenone products will lead to increased software usage and higher revenue over time 
transition to the aspenone licensing model prior to fiscal  we offered term or perpetual licenses to specific products  or specifically defined sets of products  which we refer to as point products 
the majority of our license revenue was recognized under an upfront revenue model  in which the net present value of the aggregate license fees was recognized as revenue upon shipment of the point products 
customers typically received one year of post contract software maintenance and support  or sms  with their license agreements and then could elect to renew sms annually 
revenue from sms was recognized ratably over the period in which the sms was delivered 
in fiscal  we began offering our aspenone software as a subscription model  which allows our customers access to all products within a licensed suite aspenone engineering or aspenone manufacturing and supply chain 
sms is included for the entire subscription term and customers are entitled to any software products or updates introduced into the licensed suite 
revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription on a ratable basis 
we also continue to offer customers the ability to license point products  but since fiscal  have included sms for the term of the arrangement 
beginning in fiscal  we are unable to establish evidence of the fair value for the sms component included in our point product arrangements  and revenue from these arrangements is now recognized on a ratable basis 
in fiscal and  license revenue from point product arrangements was generally recognized on the due date of each annual installment  provided all revenue recognition criteria were met 
the introduction of our aspenone licensing model and the inclusion of sms for the term of our point product arrangements did not change the method or timing of our customer billings or cash collections 
since the adoption of the aspenone licensing model  our net cash provided by operating activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal during these periods we realized steadily improving free cash flow due to the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts as well as from the renewal of customer contracts on an installment basis that were previously paid upfront 
as of june   a significant percentage of our active license agreements has been transitioned to our aspenone licensing model 
over the next few years  we anticipate that a significant portion of our remaining legacy term license arrangements will transition to the aspenone licensing model as existing license agreements reach the end of their respective original terms 
during this transition period  we may continue to have arrangements where the software element will be recognized upfront  including perpetual licenses  amendments to existing legacy term arrangements  and in limited cases  renewals of existing legacy term arrangements 
however  we do not expect revenue related to these sources to be significant in relation to our total revenue 
impact of licensing model changes the principal accounting implications of the change in our licensing model are as follows the majority of our license revenue is no longer recognized on an upfront basis 
since the upfront model resulted in the net present value of multiple years of future installments being recognized at the time of shipment  we do not expect to recognize levels of revenue comparable to our pre transition levels until a significant majority of license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model i reach the end of their original terms and ii are renewed 
accordingly  our product related revenue for fiscal  and was significantly less than the level achieved in the fiscal years preceding our licensing model change 
page 
table of contents the introduction of our aspenone licensing model resulted in operating losses for fiscal  and the change to our licensing model did not impact the incurrence or timing of our expenses  and there was no corresponding expense reduction to offset the lower revenue 
as a portion of the license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model have reached the end of their original term and been renewed under our aspenone licensing model  subscription and software revenue has steadily increased from the beginning of fiscal through fiscal to the extent the remaining term license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model expire and are renewed under our aspenone licensing model  we expect to recognize levels of revenue and operating profit comparable to  or higher than  our pre transition levels 
the sms component of our services and other revenue is expected to decrease and be offset by a corresponding increase in subscription and software revenue as customers transition to our aspenone licensing model 
under our aspenone licensing model and for point product arrangements which include sms for the contract term  the entire arrangement fee  including the sms component  is included within subscription and software revenue 
our installments receivable balance is expected to continue to decrease over time  as licenses previously executed under our upfront revenue model reach the end of their terms and are renewed under our aspenone licensing model 
under our aspenone licensing model and for point product arrangements with sms included for the contract term  installment payments are not considered fixed or determinable and  as a result  are not included in installments receivable 
these future payments are included in billings backlog  which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount of our deferred revenue is expected to continue to increase over time as an increasing portion of revenue from our term license portfolio is recognized on a subscription or ratable basis 
under our aspenone licensing model and for point product arrangements with sms included for the contract term  installments for license transactions are deferred and recognized on a ratable basis 
introduction of our enhanced sms offering beginning in fiscal  we introduced an enhanced sms offering to provide more value to our customers 
as part of this offering  customers receive x support  faster response times  dedicated technical advocates and access to web based training modules 
the enhanced sms offering is being provided to new and existing customers of both our aspenone licensing model and customers who have licensed point products with sms included for the term of the arrangement 
our annually renewable sms offering continues to be available to customers with legacy term and perpetual license agreements 
the introduction of our enhanced sms offering has resulted in a change to the revenue recognition of point product arrangements that include sms for the term of the arrangement 
beginning in fiscal  all revenue associated with point product arrangements that include the enhanced sms offering is being recognized on a ratable basis  whereas prior to fiscal  revenue was recognized under the residual method  as payments became due 
the introduction of our enhanced sms offering did not change the revenue recognition for our aspenone subscription arrangements 
revenue we generate revenue primarily from the following sources software licenses 
we provide integrated process optimization software solutions designed specifically for the process industries 
we license our software products  together with sms  primarily on a term basis  and we offer extended payment options for our term license agreements that generally require annual payments  which we also refer to as installments 
sms and training 
our sms business consists primarily of providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and updates 
we provide customer technical support services throughout the world from our customer support centers as well as via email and through our support website 
our training business provides customers with a variety of training solutions  including on site  internet based and customized training 
professional services 
we offer professional services that include implementing and integrating our technology with customers existing systems in order to improve their plant performance and gain better operational data 
customers who use our professional services typically engage us to provide those services over periods of up to months 
we charge customers for professional services on a time and materials or fixed price basis

table of contents four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and an end user  delivery of our product has occurred  the fee for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for software licenses and sms 
for professional services we use a signed contract and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order are required by the customer  we consider both taken together as evidence of the arrangement 
delivery of our product software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers via disk media with standard shipping terms of free carrier  our warehouse ie  fca  named place 
our software license agreements do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
significant judgment is involved in making this assessment 
under our upfront revenue model  we are able to demonstrate that the fees are fixed or determinable for all arrangements  including those for our term licenses that contain extended payment terms 
we have an established history of collecting under the terms of these contracts without providing concessions to customers 
in addition  we also assess whether a contract modification to an existing term arrangement constitutes a concession 
in making this assessment  significant analysis is performed to ensure that no concessions are given 
our software license agreements do not include right of return or exchange 
for license arrangements executed under the upfront revenue model  we recognize license revenue upon delivery of the software product  provided all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
with the introduction of our aspenone licensing model and the changes to the licensing terms of our point product arrangements sold on a fixed term basis  we cannot assert that the fees in these new arrangements are fixed or determinable because the rights provided to customers and the economics of the arrangements are not comparable to our transactions with other customers under the upfront revenue model 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized for these arrangements is limited by the amount of customer payments that become due 
for our term arrangements sold with sms included for the term of the arrangement  this generally results in the fees being recognized ratably over the contract term 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer s industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for certain sms offerings and for professional services  but not for our software products or our new enhanced sms offering 
we assess vsoe for sms and professional services based on an analysis of standalone sales of sms and professional services  using the bell shaped curve approach 
we do not have a history of selling our enhanced sms offering to customers on a stand alone basis  and as a result are unable to establish vsoe for this new deliverable 
we allocate the arrangement consideration among the elements included in our multi element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee for perpetual and term licenses is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element in an arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
under the upfront revenue model  the residual license fee is recognized upon delivery of the software provided all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
arrangements that qualify for upfront recognition include sales of perpetual licenses  amendments to existing legacy term arrangements and renewals of legacy term arrangements

table of contents subscription and software revenue subscription and software revenue 
subscription and software revenue consists of product and related revenue from our i aspenone subscription arrangements  ii fixed term arrangements for point product licenses with our enhanced sms offering included for the contract term referred to as point product arrangements with enhanced sms  iii legacy term arrangements referred to as legacy arrangements  and iv perpetual arrangements 
when a customer elects to license our products under our aspenone licensing model  our enhanced sms offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives  for the term of the arrangement  the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenone software suites 
these agreements combine the right to use all software products within a given product suite with sms for the term of the arrangement 
due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software products and updates  we are required to recognize the total revenue ratably over the term of the license  once the four revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
our point product arrangements with enhanced sms also include sms for the term of the arrangement 
since we do not have vsoe for our enhanced sms offering  the sms element of our point product arrangements is not separable 
as a result  the total revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the four revenue recognition criteria have been met 
perpetual license and legacy arrangements do not include the same rights as those provided to customers under the subscription based licensing model 
we continue to have vsoe for the legacy sms offering provided in support of these license arrangements and can therefore separate the undelivered elements 
accordingly  the license fees for perpetual licenses and legacy arrangements continue to be recognized upon delivery of the software products using the residual method  provided all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
services and other sms revenue sms revenue includes the maintenance revenue recognized from arrangements for which we continue to have vsoe for the undelivered sms offering 
for arrangements sold with our legacy sms offering  sms renewals are at the option of the customer  and the fair value of sms is deferred and subsequently amortized into services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations over the contractual term of the sms arrangement 
for arrangements executed under the aspenone licensing model and for point product arrangements with enhanced sms  we have not established vsoe for the enhanced sms deliverable 
as a result  the revenue related to the sms element of these transactions is reported in subscription and software revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
professional services professional services are provided to customers on a time and materials t m or fixed price basis 
we allocate the fair value of our professional services that are bundled with non aspenone subscription arrangements  and generally recognize the related revenue as the services are performed  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize professional services fees for our t m contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates 
revenue from fixed price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
professional services revenue is recognized within services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
project costs are based on standard rates  which vary by the consultant s professional level  plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement 
project costs are typically expensed as incurred 
the use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project 
we use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects 
additionally  we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance 
out of pocket expenses which have been reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue 
if the costs to complete a project are not estimable or the completion is uncertain  the revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
in those circumstances in which committed professional services arrangements are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new license arrangement  revenue is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the period the services are performed or the license term 
we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which resulted in lower than anticipated income or losses on those contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
page 
table of contents occasionally  we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize the combined revenue from the sale of the software and related services using the percentage of completion method 
when these professional services are combined with  and essential to  the functionality of an aspenone subscription transaction  the amount of combined revenue will be recognized over the longer of the subscription term on a ratable basis or the period the professional services are provided 
key components of operations revenue subscription and software revenue consists of product and related revenue from the following sources i aspenone subscription arrangements  including the bundled sms  ii point product arrangements with our enhanced sms offering included for the contract term referred to as point product arrangements with enhanced sms  iii legacy arrangements including a amendments to existing legacy term arrangements  b renewals of legacy term arrangements and c legacy arrangements that are being recognized over time as a result of not previously meeting one or more of the requirements for recognition under the upfront revenue model  and iv perpetual arrangements 
results of operations classification subscription and software revenue prior to fiscal  subscription and software revenue were each classified separately on our consolidated statements of operations  because each type of revenue had different revenue recognition characteristics  and the amount of revenue attributable to each was material in relation to our total revenues 
additionally  we were able to separate the residual amount of software revenue related to the software component of our point product arrangements which included sms for the contract term  based on the vsoe for the sms element 
as a result of the introduction of our enhanced sms offering in fiscal  the majority of our product related revenue is now recognized on a ratable basis  over the term of the arrangement 
additionally  we do not expect residual revenue from legacy term arrangements and perpetual arrangements to be significant in relation to our total revenue going forward 
since the distinction between subscription and point product ratable revenue does not represent a meaningful difference from either a line of business or revenue recognition perspective  we have combined our subscription and software revenue into a single line item on consolidated statements of operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the following table summarizes the changes to our revenue classifications and the timing of revenue recognition of subscription and software revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal ratable revenue refers to product revenue that is recognized evenly over the term of the related agreement  beginning when the first payment becomes due 
the residual method refers to the recognition of the difference between the total arrangement fee and the undiscounted vsoe for the undelivered element  assuming all other revenue recognition requirements have been met

table of contents services and other revenue 
our services and other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to professional services  standalone renewals of our legacy sms offering and training 
the amount and timing of this revenue depend on a number of factors  including whether the professional services arrangement was sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing transaction  the number  value and rate per hour of service transactions booked during the current and preceding periods  the number and availability of service resources actively engaged on billable projects  the timing of milestone acceptance for engagements contractually requiring customer sign off  the timing of negotiating and signing maintenance renewals  the timing of collection of cash payments when collectability is uncertain  and the size of the installed base of license contracts 
cost of revenue cost of subscription and software 
our cost of subscription and software revenue consists of royalties  amortization of capitalized software costs  distribution fees  the costs of providing sms on arrangements where the related revenue is recorded as subscription and software revenue  and costs related to delivery of software 
cost of services and other 
our cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel related and external consultant costs associated with providing customers professional services  sms on arrangements for which we have vsoe for the sms element  and training 
operating expenses selling and marketing expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel and travel expenses related to the effort expended to license our products and services to current and potential customers  as well as for overall management of customer relationships 
marketing expenses include expenses needed to promote our company and our products and to acquire market research and measure customer opinions to help us better understand our customers and their business needs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and external consultant expenses related to the creation of new products and to enhancements and engineering changes to existing products 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions  such as executive leadership and administration groups  finance  legal  human resources and corporate communications  and other costs such as outside professional and consultant fees and provision for bad debts 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges result from the closure or consolidation of our facilities  or from qualifying reductions in headcount 
other income and expenses interest income 
interest income is recorded for the accretion of interest on the installment payments of our term software license contracts when revenue is recognized upfront at net present value  and to a lesser extent from the investment of cash balances in short term instruments 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of charges primarily related to our secured borrowings 
secured borrowings are derived from our borrowing arrangements with unrelated financial institutions 
page 
table of contents other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange losses gains generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units 
we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to attempt to minimize the adverse impact related to unfavorable exchange rate movements  although we have not done so since fiscal historically  our foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  therefore  do not qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge treatment under the criteria of accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  derivatives and hedging 
therefore  any unrealized gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts  as well as the underlying transactions we are attempting to shield from exchange rate movements  would be recognized as a component of other income expense  net 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is comprised of current domestic and foreign taxes  and deferred benefit on us losses for which it is more likely than not that we will be able to utilize these benefits in the future 
the benefit from income taxes is comprised of the deferred benefit for tax deductions and credits that we expect to utilize in the future 
we record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 
we expect the amount of income tax expense  if any  to vary each reporting period depending upon fluctuations in our taxable income by jurisdiction 
key business metrics background with the adoption of our subscription based licensing model  our revenue for fiscal  and was significantly less than in the years preceding our model change 
since the upfront model resulted in the net present value of multiple years of future installments being recognized at the time of shipment  we do not expect to recognize levels of revenue comparable to our pre transition levels until a significant majority of license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model i reach the end of their original terms and ii are renewed 
as a result  we believe that  for the next few years  a number of our performance indicators based on us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  including revenue  gross profit  operating loss and net loss  will be of limited value in assessing our performance  growth and financial condition until a significant majority of our license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model reach the end of their original terms and are renewed under our subscription based licensing model 
accordingly  we are focusing on certain non gaap and other business metrics  including the key metrics set forth below  to track our business performance 
none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
to supplement our consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use the non gaap measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations 
management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals 
we believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund investments in future growth initiatives and it is also useful as a basis for comparing our performance with that of our competitors 
to supplement our presentation of total cost of revenue and total operating costs presented on a gaap basis  we use a non gaap measure of adjusted total costs  which excludes certain non cash and non recurring expenses 
management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it approximates the cash operating costs of the business 
the presentation of these non gaap measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities  as a measure of liquidity  or as an alternative to total cost of revenue and total operating costs as a measure of our total costs 
total term contract value total term contract value  or tcv  is an estimate of the renewal value  as of a specific date  of our active portfolio of term license agreements 
tcv is calculated by multiplying the terminal annual payment for each active term license agreement by the original length of the existing license term  and then aggregating this amount for all active term license agreements 
accordingly  tcv represents the full renewal value of all of our current term license agreements under the hypothetical assumption that all of those agreements are simultaneously renewed for the identical license terms and at the same terminal annual payment amounts 
tcv includes the value of sms for any multi year license agreements for which sms is committed for the entire license term 
tcv does not include any amounts for perpetual licenses  professional services  training or standalone renewal sms 
tcv is calculated using constant currency assumptions for agreements denominated in currencies other than us dollars in order to remove the impact of currency fluctuations between comparison dates 
page 
table of contents we also estimate a license only tcv  which we refer to as tlcv  by removing the sms portion of tcv using our historic estimated selling price for sms 
our portfolio of active license agreements currently reflects a mix of a license agreements that include sms for the entire license term and b legacy license agreements that do not include sms 
tlcv provides a consistent basis for assessing growth  particularly while customers are continuing to transition to arrangements that include sms for the term of the arrangement 
we believe tcv and tlcv are useful metrics for analyzing our business performance  particularly while we are transitioning to our aspenone licensing model and revenue comparisons between fiscal periods do not reflect the actual growth rate of our business 
comparing tcv and tlcv for different dates provides insight into the growth and retention rate of our business during the period between those dates 
tcv and tlcv increase as the result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers  renewals or modifications of existing license agreements that result in higher license fees due to price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens units of software usage or products licensed  and renewals of existing license agreements that increase the length of the license term 
the renewal of an existing license agreement will not increase tcv and tlcv unless the renewal results in higher license fees or a longer license term 
tcv and tlcv are adversely affected by customer non renewals and by renewals that result in lower license fees or a shorter license term 
our standard license term historically has been between five and six years  and we do not expect this standard term to change in the future 
many of our contracts have escalating annual payments throughout the term of the arrangement 
by calculating tcv and tlcv based on the terminal year annual payment  we are typically using the highest annual fee from the existing arrangement to calculate the hypothetical renewal value of our portfolio of term arrangements 
we estimate that tlcv grew by approximately during fiscal  from billion at june  to billion at june  the growth was attributable primarily to an increase in the number of tokens or products licensed 
we estimate that tcv grew by approximately during fiscal  from billion at june  to billion at june  future cash collections and billings backlog future cash collections is the sum of billings backlog  accounts receivable  undiscounted installments receivable and undiscounted collateralized receivables 
billings backlog represents the aggregate value of uninvoiced bookings from prior and current periods that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
prior to fiscal  the majority of bookings were recognized as revenue in the period booked and reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as installments receivable  or if sold  as collateralized receivables 
installments receivable and collateralized receivables were discounted to net present value at prevailing market rates at the time of the transaction 
amounts collected for collateralized receivables are applied to pay the related secured borrowings and are not available for any other expenditures 
under our aspenone licensing model and point product arrangements with sms included for the contract term  installment payments are not considered fixed or determinable and  as a result  are not included in installments receivable or collateralized receivables 
these future payments are included in billings backlog  which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe future cash collections is a useful metric because it provides insight into the cash generation capability of our business 
under the upfront revenue model  we did not previously monitor billings backlog or future cash collections since we believed that accounts receivable  installments receivable  collateralized receivables and certain other measures were appropriate indicators of estimated cash generation at that time 
since a substantial majority of our future bookings will reflect arrangements which include sms for the term of the arrangement  we expect installments receivable and collateralized receivables to decline 
to the extent customers have transitioned to arrangements which include sms for the term of the arrangement  our billings backlog will include the contractually committed sources of cash associated with our licensing and sms businesses 
the only sources of cash that will continue to be excluded from future cash collections will be amounts attributable to professional services  training and any remaining standalone sms

future cash collections and billings backlog are transitory metrics introduced at the launch of our aspenone licensing model  to help provide increased visibility into the cash flow potential of our business 
since the adoption of the aspenone licensing model  our net cash provided by operating activities has increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal as such  we believe we have demonstrated the cash flow potential of our business and will no longer disclose these metrics beyond fiscal the growth in billings backlog since reflects our customers adoption of our aspenone licensing model and point product arrangements with enhanced sms

adjusted total costs  which consist of total cost of revenue and total operating expenses  adjusted to exclude stock based compensation and amortization of purchased intangibles  increased by million for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the period over period increase was primarily attributable to higher compensation and related costs of million  an increase in business taxes of million  and other less significant increases which in the aggregate totaled million 
these increases were offset by a reduction in legal costs of million  lower spending on outside consultants of million  the recognition of a million gain associated with an insurance recovery  lower audit fees of million  lower recruiting and related costs of million  and other less significant reductions which in the aggregate totaled million 
in addition  the fiscal period benefited from the reversal of a previously accrued liability of million resulting from the expiration of a technology vendor relationship  as well as from the collection of previously reserved receivables resulting in a net reduction in bad debt expense of million 
these two events resulted in a reduction in expense during the period 
no similar events occurred in fiscal stock based compensation expense increased million primarily due to the incremental expense associated with the august annual program grant  which had a higher valuation than the prior year annual grant  partially offset by a decrease attributable to certain awards becoming fully vested 
please refer to the results of operations section below for additional information on year over year expense fluctuations 
fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant components of the year over year decrease in adjusted total costs were lower professional services costs excluding stock based compensation expenses of million  reduced finance related consultant and audit fees of million  and lower royalty expense due to the reversal of a previously accrued liability of million resulting from the expiration of a technology vendor relationship 
these expense decreases were partially offset by increased legal and related expenses of million 
legal expenses in the period primarily relate to the atme matter and proceedings we instituted to enforce our intellectual property rights 
legal expenses for fiscal also include expenses related to the secondary offering of our common stock  which was effective as of september  please refer to part i  item  legal proceedings  for more information on specific matters and to the results of operations section below for additional information on year over year expense fluctuations 
free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less the sum of a purchase of property  equipment and leasehold improvements and b capitalized computer software development costs 
customer collections and  consequently  cash flows from operating activities and free cash flow are primarily driven by license and services billings  rather than recognized revenue 
as a result  the introduction of our aspenone licensing model has not had an adverse impact on cash receipts 
until existing term license contracts are renewed and license related revenue returns to prior year levels  we believe free cash flow is a more relevant measure of our financial performance than income statement profitability measures such as total revenue  gross profit  operating loss and net loss 
additionally  we also believe that free cash flow is often used by security analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of software companies 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net cash flows provided by operating activities to free cash flow for the periods presented dollars in thousands year ended june  net cash provided by operating activities purchase of property  equipment  and leasehold improvements capitalized computer software development costs free cash flow non gaap total free cash flow increased million during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
page 
table of contents we have realized steadily improving free cash flow due to the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts as well as from the renewal of customer contracts on an installment basis that were previously paid upfront 
historically  certain customers elected to pay for their term licenses upfront  at a discount  rather than annually over the contract term 
contracts which were paid upfront resulted in increased cash flow variability  with higher cash flow in the period of the payment  but no cash flow in subsequent years of the contract term 
over the past few years we have reduced the incentive for customers to pay upfront by reducing the discount rate used to calculate the upfront payment 
as a result  we expect our free cash flow to continue to improve as these arrangements reach the end of their terms and are renewed on an installment basis

table of contents professional services revenue fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year decrease in professional services revenue was primarily due to decreased customer demand for professional services and to the timing of revenue recognition on certain large arrangements 
our primary focus is the successful implementation and usage of our software  and in many instances  this work can be professionally performed by qualified third parties 
we often compete with third party consulting firms when bidding for professional services contracts  particularly in developed markets 
the competitive market for services  in conjunction with increasing customer familiarity with many of our well established software products  has had an unfavorable impact on our professional services revenue over time 
under the aspenone licensing model  revenue from committed professional service arrangements that are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing transaction is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of a the period the services are performed or b the term of the related software arrangement 
as our typical contract term approximates five years  professional services revenue on these types of arrangements will usually be recognized over a longer period than under the upfront revenue model 
for fiscal  we had net deferrals of million for professional services bundled with aspenone transactions 
the timing of revenue recognition on certain large arrangements can also impact the comparability of professional services revenue from period to period 
in fiscal  we deferred the recognition of million of professional services revenue on certain large arrangements that did not meet the requirements for revenue recognition 
by comparison  in fiscal  we deferred the recognition of approximately million of professional services revenue on similar arrangements

by comparison  in fiscal  we recognized approximately million of previously deferred professional services revenue due to a large project achieving certain milestones 
sms and other revenue sms and other revenue includes annually renewed sms offered in support of our perpetual and legacy term arrangements 
fiscal compared to fiscal sms and other revenue during fiscal decreased by million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to customers transitioning to term license arrangements that include sms for the contract term  and the continued trend of customers electing to replace perpetual license arrangements with new term contracts 
under our subscription based licensing model and for point product arrangements which include sms for the contract term  the entire arrangement fee is included within subscription and software revenue 
we expect sms revenue related to perpetual arrangements and legacy term arrangements to continue to decrease as additional customers transition to our subscription based licensing model 
over the next few years  we expect that sms revenue will represent less than of our total revenue  at which time we would include sms revenue in our subscription and software line in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal sms and other revenue during fiscal decreased by million compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to customers transitioning to the aspenone licensing model  and  to a lesser extent  the continued trend of customers electing to replace perpetual license arrangements with new term contracts 
under the aspenone licensing model  sms is included in subscription revenue  whereas it was presented as services and other revenue under the upfront revenue model

table of contents expenses cost of subscription and software revenue year ended june  compared to compared to cost of subscription and software revenue gross margin fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in cost of subscription and software revenue during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was due to a larger percentage of sms services being provided to customers under our subscription based licensing model 
we allocate the portion of sms cost associated with providing support services on subscription and software arrangements in order to match the expense with the related revenue 
prior to the introduction of the aspenone licensing model in fiscal  all costs associated with providing sms were included in cost of services and other revenue 
as more customers transition to the subscription based licensing model  more of the related sms costs will be included in cost of subscription and software revenue 
in addition  the fiscal period benefited from the reversal of a previously accrued liability of million resulting from the expiration of a technology vendor relationship 
no similar event occurred in fiscal our subscription and software gross margins during fiscal were slightly higher than the prior fiscal year after excluding the impact of the reversal of the previously accrued liability for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in cost of subscription and software revenue during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the reversal of a previously accrued liability resulting from the expiration of a technology vendor relationship 
no similar event occurred in fiscal this reduction in expense was partially offset by a larger percentage of sms services being provided to customers under the aspenone licensing model 
after excluding the impact of the reversal of the previously accrued liability for fiscal  our subscription and software gross margins were slightly higher than fiscal cost of services and other revenue year ended june  compared to compared to cost of services and other revenue gross margin cost of services and other revenue includes the cost of providing professional services  training  annually renewed sms  and other revenue 
fiscal compared to fiscal cost of professional services revenue the cost of professional services revenue decreased million during fiscal  as compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower compensation and related costs 
cost of sms and other revenue cost of sms and other revenue decreased million during fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
the year over year decrease in cost of sms and other revenue was primarily due to the growth of our subscription based revenue and the associated higher allocation of sms support costs being reported in cost of subscription and software revenue 
as the subscription business grows  we expect the cost of sms revenue to continue to migrate from cost of services and other revenue to cost of subscription and software revenue 
eventually  we expect the majority of the costs of our sms business to be presented in cost of subscription and software revenue 
gross margin on cost of services and other revenue declined from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross margin on sms has historically been higher than on professional services 
as sms revenue continues to migrate to subscription and software revenue  we expect the gross margin on services and other revenue to decrease 
page 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal cost of professional services revenue the decrease in cost of professional services revenue during fiscal was primarily related to the reduction of staffing levels in the professional services organization and the timing of expense recognition on certain projects 
we reduced our staffing levels in fiscal to better align our cost structure with the decreased demand for professional services 
we received a full year of cost benefit related to these reductions in fiscal the timing of expense recognition on professional service arrangements can also impact the comparability of cost of professional services revenue from period to period 
in fiscal  we deferred costs of million on a large arrangement where we are also deferring the related revenue 
also contributing to the year over year decrease in costs was a loss accrual of approximately million related to a large professional service arrangement which was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of sms and other revenue cost of sms and other revenue decreased million in fiscal  primarily due to the migration of sms costs on our aspenone subscription arrangements to cost of subscription and software revenue 
selling and marketing expense year ended june  compared to compared to selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year increase in selling and marketing expense for fiscal was primarily the result of higher compensation and related costs of million  which includes higher stock based compensation expense of million

these expense reductions were partially offset by higher legal and related costs of million and  to a lesser extent  higher payroll and benefit related expenses 
the decrease in consultants and contractors fees was the result of our effort throughout fiscal to hire full time finance personnel to replace and further reduce our reliance on more costly external consultants 
in fiscal  significant audit costs were incurred associated with the audit and filing of all of our fiscal form q s and form k

benefit from provision for income taxes year ended june  compared to compared to benefit from provision for income taxes as a percent of revenue not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal we recognized a benefit from income taxes of million during fiscal compared to a benefit of million during fiscal the tax benefit during fiscal was derived primarily from taxable losses incurred  and our assessment that it is more likely than not that we will recognize these benefits in the future 
in addition  our benefit from income taxes included the impact of the reversal of certain tax contingencies determined under the provisions of fin in fiscal  based on our evaluation of the realizability of our us federal net operating loss carryforwards nols  foreign tax credits  and r d credits  we recognized a benefit from income taxes due to a significant reduction of our valuation allowance of million 
also during fiscal we established tax contingencies of million determined under fin these contingencies included penalties and interest  which were recorded as a component of our income tax expense 
as of june  we maintain a valuation allowance in the us primarily for certain r d credits that are anticipated to expire unused 
we also maintain a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiary nol carryforwards because it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized 
as of june  and  our total valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
while we operated at a taxable loss during fiscal  and have a history of losses  we are able to forecast sufficient future pre tax profitability  which will allow us to utilize most of our deferred tax assets 
based on our current forecast  we expect that we will utilize all of our us nols  foreign tax credits  and a portion of our research and development r d credits by fiscal  based on a with and without approach

these payments were offset by cash tax refunds of million

liquidity and capital resources resources in recent years  we have financed our operations principally with cash generated from operating activities 
as of june   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we previously maintained a bank credit facility  which we decided not to renew or extend when it matured on february  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through the financing of receivables or from public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we decide to make one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products 
if additional funding is required  we may not be able to effect a receivable  equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the periods indicated dollars in thousands year ended june  cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our primary source of cash is from the annual installments associated with our software license arrangements and related software support services  and to a lesser extent from professional services and training 
we believe that cash inflows from our term license business will grow as we benefit from the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts  and as customers renew expiring contracts that were previously paid upfront 
we anticipate that existing cash balances  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash from operating activities provided million during fiscal this amount resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for non cash items of million and a net million source of cash due to decreases in operating assets and increases in operating liabilities 
non cash expenses within net loss consisted primarily of million for stock based compensation expense  million of depreciation and amortization  and million of net unrealized foreign currency losses  partially offset by a deferred income tax benefit of million and other non cash operating activities of million 
a decrease in operating assets and an increase in operating liabilities contributed million to net cash from operating activities 
the cash generated from this change consisted of an increase in deferred revenue of million and decreases in installments and collateralized receivables totaling million 
partially offsetting these sources of cash was an increase in prepaid expenses  prepaid income taxes  and other assets of million  an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services of million and reductions in accounts payable  accrued expenses  income taxes payable and other liabilities of million

table of contents investing activities during fiscal  we used million of cash for investing activities 
the cash used consisted of million related to computer hardware and software expenditures  and million for payments for acquisitions  net of cash acquired 
during fiscal  we capitalized software development costs of million related to projects where we established technological feasibility 
we do not currently expect our future investment in capital expenditures to be materially different from recent levels in the foreseeable future 
we are not currently a party to any material purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures 
financing activities during fiscal  we used million of cash for financing activities 
we paid million for the repurchase of our common stock  made net payments on secured borrowings of million million of repayments offset by million of proceeds  received proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options  and paid withholding taxes of million on vested and settled restricted stock units during fiscal since fiscal  we have increased our cash balance while using cash to repurchase our common stock and reduce secured borrowings and amounts due to financing institutions year ended june  cash and cash equivalents treasury stock secured borrowings amounts due to financing institutions the superseding of installment contracts which serve as collateral for our secured borrowings balances can have a significant impact on our secured borrowings balance 
when previously financed receivables contracts are replaced  or superseded  with new arrangements  the secured borrowings collateralized by those receivables become immediately due and payable 
as a result  they are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until payment is remitted to the financial institution 
at june   the outstanding balance in accrued expenses and other current liabilities totaled million 
at june   the outstanding balance totaled million and included amounts related to superseding a large previously financed arrangement that had not yet been fully repaid or replaced 
these balances were repaid during fiscal the following schedule reconciles our net repayments on secured borrowings for fiscal  and dollars in thousands year ended june  secured borrowings  beginning of fiscal year secured borrowings  end of fiscal year net change in secured borrowings change in accrued expenses and other current liabilities for amounts due to financing institutions impact of foreign currency net repayments on secured borrowings we did not finance any receivables to fund operations during fiscal  and we have not done so since fiscal however  we did exchange million of previously financed receivables due to superseding existing contracts during fiscal this exchange is shown as both a use and source of funds related to secured borrowings on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
although our financing arrangements do not generally obligate us to replace superseded receivables  the terms on which we can repurchase and replace superseded receivables often make it advantageous to do so 
based on the current due dates of our secured borrowing agreements  we expect the existing balance included in our consolidated balance sheet at june  to be paid in full during fiscal  as we continue the practice of not replacing securitized borrowings as they are paid down 
page 
table of contents borrowings collateralized by receivable contracts we maintain arrangements with general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank providing for borrowings that are secured by our installment and other receivable contracts  and for which limited recourse exists against us 
under these programs  we and the financial institutions must agree to enter into each transaction and negotiate the amount borrowed and interest rate secured by each receivable 
the customers payments of the underlying receivables fund the repayment of the related amounts borrowed 
the weighted average interest rate on the secured borrowings was at june  the collateralized receivables earn interest income  and the secured borrowings accrue borrowing costs at approximately the same interest rate 
under the terms of these programs  we have transferred the receivables to the financial institutions with limited financial recourse to us 
we can be required to repurchase the receivables under certain limited circumstances in case of specific defaults by us as set forth in the program terms 
to date  we have never been required to repurchase for events of default 
the potential recourse obligations are primarily related to the silicon valley bank arrangement  which requires us to pay interest to silicon valley bank for a limited period when the underlying customer has not paid by the receivable due date 
other than the specific items noted above  the financial institution bears the credit risk of the customers associated with the receivables the institution purchased 
cash generated from operating activities has enabled us to finance our operations and pay down secured borrowings 
based on the reduced level of secured borrowing under the silicon valley bank program  during the third quarter of fiscal we reduced the aggregate amount of the program to million  leaving approximately million available at june  contractual obligations and requirements as of june   our contractual obligations consisted primarily of operating leases for our headquarters and other facilities and royalties 
there were no additional commitments for capital purchases or other expenditures at june  our contractual obligations were as follows at june  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years dollars in thousands contractual cash obligations operating leases fixed fee royalty obligations contractual royalty obligations other obligations total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments standby letters of credit total commercial commitments as of june   we had multiple agreements  which expire in september  to sublease approximately  square feet of our former office space in cambridge  massachusetts 
the above table does not reflect contractual future sublease rental income  which totaled million at june   the majority of which relates to subleases which expire on september  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our operating leases 
the standby letters of credit were issued by silicon valley bank in the united states and secure performance on professional services contracts and rental agreements 
the above table does not reflect any amounts relating to transfers of certain receivables under our receivable sale facilities 
repayments of borrowings under these facilities are funded by the payments made by the customer either to the applicable financial institution directly or to us as agent  with no financial recourse to us 
since we do not have any contractual obligation to fund these payments and there are no financial guarantees issued in relation to these transactions  we do not have any contractual payment obligations relating to these transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
page 
table of contents we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  and loss contingencies 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition four basic criteria must be satisfied before software license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and an end user  delivery of our product has occurred  the fee for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement we use a contract signed by the customer as evidence of an arrangement for software licenses and sms 
for professional services we use a signed contract and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
in cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order are required by the customer  we consider both taken together as evidence of the arrangement 
delivery of our product software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers via disk media with standard shipping terms of free carrier  aspen technology s warehouse ie  fca  named place 
our software license agreements do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
significant judgment is involved in making this assessment 
under our upfront revenue model  we are able to demonstrate that the fees are fixed or determinable for all arrangements  including those for our term licenses that contain extended payment terms 
we have an established history of collecting under the terms of these contracts without providing concessions to customers 
in addition  we also assess whether contract modifications to an existing term arrangement constitute a concession 
in making this assessment  significant analysis is performed to ensure that no concessions are given 
our software license agreements do not include right of return or exchange 
for license arrangements executed under the upfront revenue model  we recognize license revenue upon delivery of the software product  provided all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
with the introduction of our aspenone licensing model and the changes to the licensing terms of our point product arrangements sold on a fixed term basis  we cannot assert that the fees in these new arrangements are fixed or determinable because the rights provided to customers and the economics of the arrangements are not comparable to our transactions with other customers under the upfront revenue model 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized for these arrangements is limited by the amount of customer payments that become due 
for our term arrangements sold with sms included for the term of the arrangement  this generally results in the fees being recognized ratably over the contract term 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer s industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  or vsoe  for certain sms offerings and for professional services  but not for our software products or our new enhanced sms offering 
we assess vsoe for sms and professional services based on an analysis of standalone sales of sms and professional services  using the bell shaped curve approach 
we do not have a history of selling our enhanced sms offering to customers on a stand alone basis  and as a result are unable to establish vsoe for this new deliverable 
page 
table of contents we allocate the arrangement consideration among the elements included in our multi element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee for perpetual and term licenses is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element in an arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
under the upfront revenue model  the residual license fee is recognized upon delivery of the software provided all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
arrangements that qualify for upfront recognition include sales of perpetual licenses  amendments to existing legacy term arrangements and renewals of legacy term arrangements 
subscription and software revenue subscription and software revenue 
subscription and software revenue consists of product and related revenue from our i aspenone licensing arrangements  ii fixed term arrangements for point product licenses with our enhanced sms offering included for the contract term referred to as point product arrangements with enhanced sms  iii legacy term arrangements referred to as legacy arrangements  and iv perpetual arrangements 
when a customer elects to license our products under our aspenone licensing model  our enhanced sms offering is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives  for the term of the arrangement  the right to any new unspecified future software products and updates that may be introduced into the licensed aspenone software suite 
these agreements combine the right to use all software products within a given product suite with sms for the term of the arrangement 
due to our obligation to provide unspecified future software products and updates  we are required to recognize the total revenue ratably over the term of the license  once the four revenue recognition criteria noted above have been met 
our point product arrangements with enhanced sms also include sms for the term of the arrangement 
since we do not have vsoe for our enhanced sms offering  the sms element of our point product arrangements is not separable 
as a result  the total revenue is also recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  once the four revenue recognition criteria have been met 
perpetual license and legacy arrangements do not include the same rights as those provided to customers under the subscription based licensing model 
we continue to have vsoe for the legacy sms offering provided in support of these license arrangements and can therefore separate the undelivered elements 
accordingly  the license fees for perpetual licenses and legacy arrangements continue to be recognized upon delivery of the software products using the residual method  provided all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
services and other sms revenue sms revenue includes the maintenance revenue recognized from arrangements for which we continue to have vsoe for the undelivered sms offering 
for arrangements sold with our legacy sms offering  sms renewals are at the option of the customer  and the fair value of sms is deferred and subsequently amortized into services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations over the contractual term of the sms arrangement 
for arrangements executed under the aspenone licensing model and for point product arrangements with enhanced sms  we have not established vsoe for the sms deliverable 
as a result  the revenue related to the sms element of these transactions is reported in subscription and software revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
professional services revenue professional services are provided to customers on a time and materials t m or fixed price basis 
we allocate the fair value of our professional services that are bundled with non aspenone subscription arrangements  and generally recognize the related revenue as the services are performed  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we recognize professional services fees for our t m contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates 
revenue from fixed price engagements is recognized using the proportional performance method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
professional services revenue is recognized within services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
project costs are based on standard rates  which vary by the consultant s professional level  plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement 
project costs are typically expensed as incurred 
the use of the proportional performance method is dependent upon our ability to reliably estimate the costs to complete a project 
we use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects 
additionally  we believe that costs are the best available measure of performance 
out of pocket expenses which have been reimbursed by customers are recorded as revenue 
page 
table of contents if the costs to complete a project are not estimable or the completion is uncertain  the revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
in those circumstances in which committed professional services arrangements are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  an aspenone subscription arrangement or point product arrangement that includes sms for the term of the arrangement  revenue is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of the period the services are performed or the license term 
we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which resulted in lower than anticipated income or losses on those contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
occasionally  we provide professional services considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize the combined revenue from the sale of the software and related services using the percentage of completion method 
when these professional services are combined with  and essential to  the functionality of an aspenone subscription transaction  the amount of combined revenue will be recognized over the longer of the subscription term or the period the professional services are provided 
accounting for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets can result from unused operating losses  and research and development and foreign tax credit carryforwards and deductions recorded for financial statement purposes prior to them being deductible on a tax return 
valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
we consider  among other available information  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  limitations on the availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and other evidence assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are included in the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period they become known or can be estimated 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets may be recoverable 
a significant portion of the us valuation allowance was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal year while we are currently operating at a taxable loss and have a history of losses  we have been able to forecast future operating results sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets 
in weighing the cumulative losses against our ability to forecast operating results and the incremental growth in our installed base of customers and acceptance of our subscription based licensing model  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize these assets 
based on our current forecast  we expect that we will utilize all of our nols  foreign tax credits  and a portion of our r d credits by fiscal  based on a with and without approach 
we have retained a small valuation allowance in the us for the deferred tax asset related to our unrealized capital losses and r d credits of million 
we do not have any investments currently that would give rise to a capital gain  and as a result  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not receive a benefit from this deferred tax asset 
we have also retained a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiaries nol carryforwards 
at june   our total valuation allowance was million 
for fiscal  our income tax provision included amounts determined under the provisions of fin  accounting for uncertain tax positions currently included as provisions of asc topic  which was adopted as of july  and is intended to satisfy additional income tax assessments  including interest and penalties  that could result from any tax return positions for which the likelihood of sustaining the position on audit does not meet a threshold of more likely than not 
the tax accrual included penalties and interest  which were recorded as a component of our income tax expense 
tax liabilities under fin were recorded as a component of our income taxes payable and other non current liabilities balance and totaled million as of june  the ultimate amount of taxes due will not be known until examinations are completed and settled or the audit periods are closed by statute 
page 
table of contents our us and foreign tax returns are subject to periodic compliance examinations by various local and national tax authorities through periods defined by the tax code in the applicable jurisdiction 
the years prior to are closed in the united states  although the utilization of nol carryforwards and tax credits generated in earlier periods will keep these periods open for examination 
similarly  the years prior to are closed in the united kingdom  although the utilization of nol carryforwards generated in earlier periods will keep the periods open for examination 
our canadian subsidiaries are subject to audit from forward  and certain other of our international subsidiaries are subject to audit from forward 
in connection with examinations of tax filings  tax contingencies can arise from differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations relative to the amount  timing or proper inclusion or exclusion of revenue and expenses in taxable income or loss 
loss contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue estimated liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation and other sources when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the claim  assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
change in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements  we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on  among other things  allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
in most cases  in the event of an infringement claim  we retain the right to procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product or to replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality 
these indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with asc topic in most cases  and where legally enforceable  the indemnification refund is limited to the amount of the license fees paid by the customer
