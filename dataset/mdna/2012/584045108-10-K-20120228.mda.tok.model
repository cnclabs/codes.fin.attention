item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with this entire annual report on form k  including the risk factors section and our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
the discussion and analysis below includes certain forward looking statements that are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors described in risk factors and elsewhere in this report that could cause our actual future growth  results of operations  performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
see note on forward looking statements herein 
overview we provide technology enabled products and services which together deliver solutions designed to improve operating margin  cash flow and overall operational effectiveness for hospitals  health systems and other ancillary 
table of contents or non acute healthcare providers 
our solutions are designed to efficiently analyze detailed information across the spectrum of revenue cycle  spend and clinical resource management processes 
our solutions integrate with existing operations and enterprise software systems of our clients and provide financial improvement with minimal upfront costs or capital expenditures 
our operations and clients are primarily located throughout the united states 
our full year results included total consolidated net revenue of million  a increase over these results were primarily driven by our broadlane acquisition as well as growth in net administrative fees from our gpo services  continued demand for medical device  clinical and performance improvement consulting services  as well as growth in revenue cycle technology tools 
we reported a net loss of million  or a loss of per diluted share  due primarily to acquisition related intangible amortization expense and higher interest expense 
our non gaap adjusted ebitda was million  a increase over last year 
we believe the acquisition of broadlane has positioned our business to offer a comprehensive solution set and enhanced value proposition for our current client base and a greater opportunity to cross sell additional products and services to current and prospective clients 
overall  we believe that our business model and best practice solutions can provide our client base with the direction and support to manage total costs  optimize revenue  secure reimbursement  reduce waste  and increase cash flow for healthcare providers as the slow economic recovery and impact of health insurance reform continue to impact their financial stability and provision of care 
management s primary metrics to measure the consolidated financial performance of the business are net revenue  non gaap gross fees  non gaap revenue share obligation  non gaap adjusted ebitda  non gaap adjusted ebitda margin and non gaap diluted adjusted eps which we formerly referred to as non gaap diluted cash eps 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  our primary results of operations included the following fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  change change amount amount amount amount amount amount in millions in millions gross fees revenue share obligation total net revenue operating income loss net loss income adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted eps these are non gaap measures 
see use of non gaap financial measures section for additional information 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated non gaap gross fees of million and million  respectively  and total net revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increases in non gaap gross fees and total net revenue in the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the broadlane acquisition on november   growth in our scm segment from our medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services  and vendor administrative fees as well as revenue related to achievement of certain client financial performance targets earned during the year  and 
table of contents growth in our rcm segment from our revenue cycle technology tools offset by a decline in our revenue cycle services 
for the fiscal year ended december   we generated operating income of million compared to an operating loss of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in operating income compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above in addition to approximately million in achieved cost reductions relating to combining the operations of broadlane with our operations offset by the following increased cost of revenue within our scm segment attributable to a higher percentage of net revenue being derived from service based engagements  higher operating expenses related to increased compensation expense for new and existing personnel  inclusive of performance based incentive compensation expense  an increase in amortization expense of acquired intangibles  and an increase in depreciation expense from additions of property and equipment including purchased software and fixed assets acquired in the broadlane acquisition  partially offset by lower depreciation expense from the change in useful life in our internally developed software 
for the fiscal year ending december   the increase in non gaap adjusted ebitda compared to the fiscal year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above  which included performance related revenue that has a higher contribution margin and represented and of consolidated net revenue  respectively  in addition to achieved cost reductions realized from combining the operations of broadlane with our existing operations partially offset by higher operating expenses inclusive of performance based incentive compensation expense 
the non gaap adjusted ebitda margin remained relatively consistent with the prior period decreasing slightly primarily due to the increase in performance based incentive compensation 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  we generated non gaap gross fees of million and million  respectively  and total net revenue of million and million  respectively 
the increases in non gaap gross fees and total net revenue in the fiscal year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the broadlane acquisition  growth in our rcm segment from our comprehensive revenue cycle services and technology solutions  and growth in our scm segment from our medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services and our vendor administrative fees 
for the fiscal year ended december   we generated an operating loss of million compared to operating income of million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in operating income compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above offset by the following higher acquisition related expenses in connection with i acquisition and integration costs associated with our recent broadlane acquisition  and ii certain due diligence and acquisition related costs pursuant to an unsuccessful acquisition attempt  impairment charges primarily relating to i a write off of goodwill from our decision support services operating unit  and ii a certain scm trade name and a customer base intangible asset from prior acquisitions that were deemed to be impaired as part of the product and service offering integration associated with the broadlane acquisition  increased cost of revenue attributable to i a higher percentage of net revenue being derived from service based engagements within our rcm and scm segments  and ii higher direct costs relating to certain new and existing client arrangements whereby the related revenue associated with these 
table of contents arrangements is contingent upon meeting financial performance targets 
the related revenue is proportionally recorded as the performance targets are achieved 
the increase in these types of arrangements was concentrated within our scm segment  higher operating expenses related to increased compensation expense for new and existing personnel  an increase in amortization expense of acquired intangibles  and an increase in depreciation expense from additions to property and equipment including purchased software in conjunction with fixed assets acquired in the broadlane acquisition 
for the fiscal year ending december   increases in non gaap adjusted ebitda and non gaap adjusted ebitda margin compared to the fiscal year ended december  were primarily attributable to the net revenue increase discussed above  as well as lower expense growth due to certain management cost control initiatives and lower performance based incentive compensation expense during the year  partially offset by increased cost of revenue from segment revenue and product mix  including a shift to more service based revenue and increased corporate operating expenses 
segment structure and revenue streams effective january   we realigned our decision support services or dss under our scm segment from our rcm segment 
we believe that this realignment will help us capitalize on the integration of our products and services  and to better focus on offering data driven tools and services to help bridge our clients clinical and financial gaps so they can produce higher quality patient outcomes at a lower cost 
as a result of this move  our results of operations  management s discussion and analysis  and other applicable sections herein have been recast to reflect this change for all periods presented and dss will be included within our scm performance analytics offerings in subsequent periods 
we deliver our solutions through two business segments  revenue cycle management rcm and spend and clinical resource management scm 
management s primary metrics to measure consolidated and segment financial performance are net revenue  non gaap gross fees  non gaap revenue share obligation  non gaap adjusted ebitda  non gaap adjusted ebitda margin  non gaap diluted adjusted eps and segment adjusted ebitda 
all of our revenues are from external clients and inter segment revenues have been eliminated 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements herein for discussion on segment adjusted ebitda and certain items of our segment results of operations and financial position 
revenue cycle management our rcm segment provides a comprehensive suite of products and services spanning the hospital revenue cycle workflow from patient access and financial responsibility  charge capture and integrity  pricing analysis  claims processing and denials management  payor contract management  revenue recovery and accounts receivable services 
our workflow solutions  together with our data management  compliance and audit tools  increase revenue capture and cash collections  reduce accounts receivable balances and increase regulatory compliance 
our rcm segment revenue is listed under the caption other service fees on our consolidated statements of operations and consists of the following components  which are also discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements subscription and implementation fees 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly or annual basis on multi year contracts for client access to our saas based solutions 
we may also charge our clients non refundable upfront fees for implementation of our saas based services 
these non refundable upfront fees are earned over the subscription period or estimated customer relationship period  whichever is longer 
we defer costs related to implementation services and expense these costs in proportion to the revenue earned over the subscription period or customer relationship period  as applicable 

table of contents in addition  we defer upfront sales commissions related to subscription and implementation fees and expense these costs ratably over the related contract term 
transaction fees 
for certain of our revenue cycle management solutions  we earn fees that vary based on the volume of client transactions or enrolled members 
service fees 
for certain of our rcm solutions  we earn fees based on a percentage of cash remittances collected  fixed fee and cost plus consulting arrangements 
the related revenues are earned as services are rendered 
spend and clinical resource management on november   we completed the acquisition of broadlane  a leading provider of group purchasing  supply chain outsourcing and centralized procurement services  capital equipment lifecycle management  clinical and lean process consulting  and clinical workforce optimization solutions 
with the addition of broadlane  our scm segment provides a comprehensive suite of cost management services and supply chain analytics and data capabilities that help our clients manage many of their expense categories 
our solutions lower supply and medical device costs and help to improve clinical resource utilization by managing the procurement process through our strategic sourcing of supplies and purchased services  discounted pricing through our group purchasing organization s portfolio of contracts  consulting services and business analytics and intelligence tools 
our scm segment revenue consists of the following components administrative fees and revenue share obligation 
we earn administrative fees from manufacturers  distributors and other vendors collectively referred to as vendors of products and services with whom we have contracts under which our group purchasing organization clients may purchase products and services 
administrative fees represent a percentage  which we refer to as our administrative fee ratio  typically ranging from to of the purchases made by our group purchasing organization clients through contracts with our vendors 
our group purchasing organization clients make purchases  and receive shipments  directly from the vendors 
generally on a monthly or quarterly basis  vendors provide us with a report describing the purchases made by our clients through our group purchasing organization vendor contracts  including associated administrative fees 
we recognize revenue upon the receipt of these reports from vendors 
some client contracts require that a portion of our administrative fees be contingent upon achieving certain financial improvements  such as lower supply costs  which we refer to as performance targets 
contingent administrative fees are not recognized as revenue until we receive customer acceptance on the achievement of those contractual performance targets 
prior to receiving client acceptance of performance targets  we record contingent administrative fees as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
often  recognition of this revenue occurs in periods subsequent to the recognition of the associated costs 
should we fail to meet a performance target  we may be contractually obligated to refund some or all of the contingent fees 
additionally  in many cases  we are contractually obligated to pay a portion of the administrative fees to our hospital and health system clients 
typically this amount  which we refer to as our revenue share obligation  is calculated as a percentage of administrative fees earned on a particular client s purchases from our vendors 
our total net revenue on our consolidated statements of operations is shown net of the revenue share obligation 
other service fees 
the following items are included as other service fees in our consolidated statement of operations consulting fees 
we consult with our clients regarding the costs and utilization of medical devices and physician preference items ppi and the efficiency and quality of their key clinical service lines 
our consulting projects are typically fixed fee projects with an average duration of six to nine months  and the related revenues are earned as services are rendered 
we generate revenue from consulting contracts that also include performance targets 
the performance targets generally relate to committed financial 
table of contents improvement to our clients from the use and implementation of initiatives that result from our consulting services 
performance targets are measured as our strategic initiatives are identified and implemented  and the financial improvement can be quantified by the client 
prior to receiving client acceptance of performance targets  we record contingent consulting fees as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet 
often  recognition of this revenue occurs in periods subsequent to the recognition of the associated costs 
should we fail to meet a performance target  we may be contractually obligated to refund some or all of the contingent fees 
subscription fees 
we also offer technology enabled services that provide spend management analytics and data services to improve operational efficiency  reduce supply costs  and increase transparency across spend management processes 
we earn fixed subscription fees on a monthly basis for these company hosted saas based solutions 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses as follows cost of revenue 
cost of revenue primarily consists of the direct labor costs incurred to generate our revenue 
direct labor costs consist primarily of salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and other direct costs and share based compensation expenses related to personnel who provide services to implement our solutions for our clients indirect labor costs for these personnel are included in general and administrative expenses 
as the majority of our services are generated internally  our costs to provide these services are primarily labor driven 
a less significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of costs of third party products and services and client reimbursed out of pocket costs 
cost of revenue does not include certain expenses relating to hosting our services and providing support and related data center capacity which is included in general and administrative expenses  and allocated amounts for rent  depreciation  amortization or other indirect operating costs because we do not consider the inclusion of these items in cost of revenue relevant to our business 
however  cost of revenue does include the amortization for the cost of software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
as a result of the broadlane acquisition and related integration  there may be some re allocation of expenses primarily between cost of revenue and general and administrative expense resulting from the implementation of our accounting expense allocation policies that could affect period over period and acquisition affected comparability 
in addition  any changes in revenue mix between our rcm and scm segments  including changes in revenue mix towards saas based revenue and consulting services  may cause significant fluctuations in our cost of revenue and have a favorable or unfavorable impact on operating income 
product development expenses 
product development expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense of the technology professionals who develop  support and maintain our software related products and services 
product development expenses are net of capitalized software development costs for both internal and external use 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to marketing programs including trade shows and brand messaging  personnel related expenses for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense  certain meeting costs and travel related expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses for administrative employees and indirect time related to operational service based employees including salaries  benefits  incentive compensation and share based compensation expense and travel related expenses  occupancy and other indirect costs  insurance costs  professional fees  and other general overhead expenses 
acquisition and integration related expenses 
acquisition and integration related expenses may consist of i costs incurred to complete acquisitions including due diligence  consulting and other related fees  ii integration and restructuring type costs relating to our completed acquisitions  and iii acquisition related fees associated with unsuccessful acquisition attempts 

table of contents depreciation 
depreciation expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and the amortization of software  including capitalized costs of software developed for internal use 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles includes the amortization of all identified intangible assets with the exception of software  primarily resulting from acquisitions 
key considerations certain significant items or events must be considered to better understand differences in our results of operations from period to period 
we believe that the following items or events have had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods discussed below or may have a material impact on our results of operations in future periods broadlane acquisition we consummated the broadlane acquisition on november  during  we finalized the purchase price with broadlane llc 
as a result  we recorded an adjustment of approximately million which decreased the deferred purchase consideration and goodwill 
the final adjusted deferred purchase consideration amount of million was paid by the company in january in connection with combining the operations of broadlane with our operations  we have realized expense savings of approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  purchase accounting in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we recorded an administrative fee and other service fee revenue adjustment  which was determined as part of purchase accounting and recorded as part of the purchase price allocation 
the purchase accounting adjustment was recorded as an accounts receivable relating to these administrative fees with a related revenue share obligation 
this change only impacted our scm segment 
we include a purchase accounting adjustment line item in our non gaap adjusted ebitda reconciliation to account for these adjustments as it relates to the broadlane acquisition 
the adjustments relating to the broadlane acquisition were finalized during the fourth quarter of credit facility and notes offering on november   in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we entered into the credit agreement with barclays bank plc and jp morgan securities llc and closed a private placement offering of senior notes due the company used the entire borrowings from the credit agreement and the net proceeds from the offering of senior notes to finance the purchase price of the broadlane acquisition and repay outstanding indebtedness of the company and broadlane 
credit facility the credit agreement consists of a six year million senior secured term loan facility and a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility  including a letter of credit sub facility of million and a swing line sub facility of million 
both the senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility charge a variable interest rate of libor or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin 
on march   we entered into the first amendment to our existing credit agreement 
the first amendment redefined the swing line lender as bank of america  na from barclays bank 
in connection with the first amendment  we executed an auto borrowing plan with bank of america  na this enabled the company to reinstitute our cash management practice of voluntarily applying any excess cash to repay our swing line credit facility  if any  on a daily basis or against our revolving credit facility on a routine basis when our swing line credit facility is undrawn 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents notes offering also in connection with the broadlane acquisition  the company closed the offering of an aggregate principal amount of million of senior notes due the notes 
the notes will mature on november   and bear annual interest 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning on may  on july   the company filed a registration statement with the sec on form s for the purpose of registering new senior notes with the same terms and conditions as the notes 
the registration statement was declared effective on october   and on the same day the company launched an exchange offer whereby the company offered to exchange new registered senior notes due the exchange notes for all of the outstanding unregistered notes the exchange offer 
the terms of the exchange notes are substantially identical to those of the notes  except the exchange notes are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
the exchange notes evidence the same indebtedness as the notes and are entitled to the benefits of the indenture governing the notes 
the company did not and will not receive any proceeds from the exchange offer 
the notes and the exchange notes are now interchangeably referred to as the notes 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
impairment of assets during  certain of our assets were deemed to be impaired as they no longer provided future economic benefit 
such assets primarily included goodwill associated with our decision support services operating unit  certain acquired trade names  developed technology  and internally developed software 
in connection with our annual impairment testing  we recognized an impairment charge related to the goodwill at our decision support services operating unit within our scm reporting segment 
we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling million during the fiscal year ended december  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
performance based incentive compensation during  we partially funded our discretionary bonus and incentive pool  which resulted in higher operating expenses and lower adjusted ebitda in year over year comparisons 
during and  we did not fund our discretionary bonus and incentive pool  which had a favorable impact on operating expenses and adjusted ebitda for the fiscal years ended december  and share based compensation during  we reversed million of previously recorded share based compensation expense related to certain performance based ssars and performance based restricted stock that were granted under the medassets  inc long term performance incentive plan in the share based compensation expense was reversed due to non achievement of certain performance criteria 
rcm management restructuring plan our management approved and initiated a plan to restructure our operations resulting in certain management changes within our rcm segment 
during the fiscal year ended december   we expensed costs of approximately million associated with restructuring activities consisting of severance costs 
these costs are included within the product development and general and administrative expense line items on the consolidated statements of operations 
termination of interest rate swaps in november  we terminated an interest rate swap as part of the broadlane acquisition that was originally set to terminate in march in consideration of the early termination  we paid the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of million for the fiscal year ended december  accordingly  the swap is no longer recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  
table of contents share repurchase program on august   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock

refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements herein for additional information on the amount and cost of shares we repurchased during the fiscal year ended december  under the share repurchase program 
segment reporting effective january   we realigned our decision support services and performance analytics business operations under our scm segment from our rcm segment 
all prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this realignment 
use of estimates preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
during march  we adjusted our estimates related to our customer relationship period and internally developed software useful life  as discussed below 
customer relationship period we finalized a study of our customer relationship period using data based on our historical experience 
as a result of the study  we changed our customer relationship period for which we recognize revenue related to implementation and setup fees charged for our saas based services from an average of four years to six years  effective january  we will apply this change in estimate on a prospective basis 
the impact of the change in customer relationship period reduced our other service fee revenue by approximately million 
internally developed software useful life we finalized a study of our internally developed software useful life based on our historical experience 
as a result of the study  we changed our useful life for which we will recognize depreciation expense related to internally developed software from three years to up to but generally five years  effective january  we will apply this change in estimate on a prospective basis 
the impact of the change in internally developed software useful life reduced our depreciation expense by approximately million

total net revenue 
total net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in total net revenue was comprised of a million increase in rcm revenue and a million increase in scm revenue 
for the fiscal years ended december  and  performance related revenue as a percentage of consolidated net revenue amounted to and  respectively 
revenue cycle management revenue 
rcm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from net revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in revenue from our revenue cycle technology tools partially offset by an million decrease in revenue from our comprehensive revenue cycle service engagements 
as we engage new clients  renew with existing clients and complete existing contracts  we will continue to experience fluctuations in our revenue cycle services financial performance as the business is characterized by a relatively small number of agreements  which each relate to large amounts of revenue 
spend and clinical resource management net revenue 
scm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was the result of an increase in non gaap gross administrative fees of million  or  partially offset by a million increase in non gaap revenue share obligation  and an increase in other service fees of million 
gross administrative fees 
non gaap gross administrative fee revenue increased by million  or  as compared to the prior period  primarily due to the broadlane acquisition in addition to higher purchasing volumes by new and existing clients under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors as well as an increase in the average administrative fee percentage realized from our manufacturer and distributor contracts 
we may have fluctuations in our non gaap gross administrative fee revenue in future periods as the timing of vendor reporting and client acknowledgement of achieved performance targets varies 
revenue share obligation 
non gaap revenue share obligation increased million  or  as compared to the prior period 
we analyze the impact of our non gaap revenue share obligation on our results of operations by calculating the ratio of non gaap revenue share obligation to non gaap gross administrative fees including administrative fees not subject to a variable revenue share obligation or the revenue share ratio 
our revenue share ratio was and for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
we will continue to experience fluctuations in our revenue 
table of contents share ratio based on clients who are entitled to a higher revenue share percentage due to increased purchasing volume in addition to an increase in the number of fixed fee arrangements 
we did not have any significant change in our client revenue mix during the year that resulted in a material impact on our revenue share ratio 
broadlane related revenue 
in our fiscal year ended december   the operating results of broadlane were included for forty six days beginning with the closing of the broadlane acquisition on november  as discussed further below  approximately million and million of estimated net administrative fees for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively  associated with the broadlane acquisition were excluded from our financial results because of gaap relating to business combinations 
given the significant impact of the broadlane acquisition on our scm segment  we believe acquisition affected measures are useful for the comparison of our year over year net revenue growth 
scm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from scm non gaap acquisition affected net revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the following table sets forth the reconciliation of scm non gaap acquisition affected net revenue to scm gaap net revenue fiscal year ended december  change amount amount amount unaudited  in thousands scm net revenue broadlane acquisition related adjustment broadlane purchase accounting revenue adjustment total scm acquisition affected net revenue these are non gaap measures 
see use of non gaap financial measures section for additional information 
upon acquiring broadlane  we made a purchase accounting adjustment that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to customer purchases that occurred prior to november   but were reported to us subsequent to that date 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and recording any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
for the fiscal year ended december   the million represents the net amount of i million in gross administrative fees and million in other service fees based on vendor reporting received from january  through november  related to purchases made prior to the acquisition date  and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million 
for the fiscal year ended december   the million represents the net amount of i million in gross administrative fees based on vendor reporting received from the acquisition date up through december   and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million 
other service fees 
the million  or  increase in other service fees primarily related to million in higher revenues from medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services inclusive of broadlane 
the growth in supply chain consulting was mainly due to an increased number of engagements from new and existing clients coupled with other service fee revenue relating to consulting 
table of contents and sourcing services from the broadlane acquisition 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in revenue relating to our decision support services business primarily due to a scheduled and planned step down in license fees from a certain client

the increase was offset by a million decrease in cost of revenue which was associated with i a decrease in service related engagements primarily in our revenue cycle services business  which result in a lower cost of revenue given these activities are more labor intensive  and ii a decrease in cost of revenue from our decision support services business which was driven by lower revenue as previously discussed 
product development expenses 
product development expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  or of total net revenue  an increase of million  or  from product development expenses of million  or of total net revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  excluding the impact of the broadlane acquisition  our product development expenses as a percentage of related net revenue was for the fiscal year ended december  of the increase  million was attributable to product development expenses associated with the broadlane acquisition 
the remaining increase was attributable to a million increase in professional fees  and a million increase in compensation expense inclusive of performance based incentive compensation 
table of contents expense to new and existing employees 
our product development capitalization rate for the fiscal year ended december  and  was and  respectively 
the higher capitalization rate for the fiscal year ended december  was primarily due to i an increase in product and development within our scm reporting unit attributable to investments in integration related activities in connection with combining the operations of broadlane with our existing operations  and ii an increase in rcm investments in product and development primarily due to new product features and functionality  new technologies  and upgrades to our service offerings 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  or of total net revenue  an increase of million  or  from selling and marketing expenses of million  or of total net revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  excluding the impact of the broadlane acquisition  selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of related net revenue was for the fiscal year ended december  of the increase  million was attributable to selling and marketing expenses associated with the broadlane acquisition 
the remaining increase was attributable to a million increase in compensation expense inclusive of performance based incentive compensation expense relating to new and existing employees  a million increase in expenses associated with our client and vendor meeting  a million increase in transportation expense  a million increase in advertising expense  and a million increase in meetings expense 
the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in share based compensation expense resulting from the reversal of share based compensation expense relating to certain performance based equity awards as discussed in key considerations as well as the use of the accelerated method of expense attribution used for our service based equity awards that are subject to graded vesting  which comprises a majority of our total equity awards 
this method results in a continual decrease in annual share based compensation expense with respect to each grant over the requisite service period of such grant 
total expenses related to our client and vendor meeting amounted to million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  or of total net revenue  an increase of million  or  from general and administrative expenses of million  or of total net revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  excluding the impact of the broadlane acquisition  our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of related net revenue was for the fiscal year ended december  of the increase  million was attributable to the broadlane acquisition

the increase was partially offset by a million decrease in share based compensation expense for the reason described within selling and marketing expenses  and a million decrease in bad debt expense due to significantly lower uncollectable accounts compared to the prior year 
acquisition and integration related expenses 
acquisition and integration related expenses for the fiscal year ended december  were million  or of total net revenue  an increase of million  or  from acquisition and integration related expenses of million  or of total net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was attributable to integration and restructuring type costs associated with the broadlane acquisition  including severance  retention  redundant salaries  certain performance related salary based compensation  and operating infrastructure costs 
we expect to incur costs in future periods to fully integrate broadlane  including aligning service offerings and standardizing and migrating certain broadlane operational systems and transactional data sets into our operational systems 
however  we expect these additional costs will be substantially less than those incurred in 
table of contents depreciation 
depreciation expense for the fiscal year ended december  was million  or of total net revenue  an increase of million  or  from depreciation of million  or of total net revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to depreciation resulting from purchases of property and equipment inclusive of increases to capitalized software development subsequent to december  the increase was partially offset by the change to extend the estimated useful life of our internally developed software as discussed in key considerations

scm net revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from revenue of million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase was the result of an increase in non gaap gross administrative fees of million  or  partially offset by a million increase in non gaap revenue share obligation  and an increase in other service fees of million 
gross administrative fees 
non gaap gross administrative fee revenue increased by million  or  as compared to the prior period  due to higher purchasing volumes by new and existing clients under our group purchasing organization contracts with our manufacturer and distributor vendors as well as an increase in the average administrative fee percentage realized from our manufacturer and distributor contracts 
revenue share obligation 
non gaap revenue share obligation increased million  or  as compared to the prior period 
we analyze the impact of our non gaap revenue share obligation on our results of operations by calculating the ratio of non gaap revenue share obligation to non gaap gross administrative fees including administrative fees not subject to a variable revenue share obligation or the revenue share ratio 
our revenue share ratio was and for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in clients who are entitled to a higher revenue share percentage due to increased purchasing volume 
we did not have any significant change in our client revenue mix during the year that resulted in a material impact on our revenue share ratio 

table of contents broadlane related revenue 
the operating results of broadlane were included in our fiscal year ended december  for forty six days beginning with the closing of the broadlane acquisition on november  in  million of the net revenue increase was attributable to the broadlane acquisition  which was comprised of million in net administrative fee revenue and million in other service fee revenue 
as discussed further below  approximately million of estimated net administrative fees associated with the broadlane acquisition was excluded from our financial results because of gaap relating to business combinations 
given the significant impact of the broadlane acquisition on our scm segment  we believe acquisition affected measures are useful for the comparison of our year over year net revenue growth

see use of non gaap financial measures section for additional information 
upon acquiring broadlane  we made a purchase accounting adjustment that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to customer purchases that occurred prior to november   but were reported to us subsequent to that date 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and recording any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
the million represents the net amount of i million in gross administrative fees based on vendor reporting received from the acquisition date up through december   and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million 
other service fees 
the million  or  increase in other service fees primarily related to million in higher revenues from medical device consulting and strategic sourcing services inclusive of broadlane

critical accounting policy disclosure the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we find reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different conditions 
management believes that the following accounting judgments and uncertainties are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents revenue recognition in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  we recognize revenue when a there is a persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the fee is fixed or determinable  c services have been rendered and payment has been contractually earned  and d collectability is reasonably assured 
inclusive in our revenue recognition policies  we are required to make certain critical judgments that impact the period over which revenue is recognized 
these judgments are described below 
subscription and implementation fees we apply the revenue recognition guidance prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap relating to software for our hosted solutions 
we provide subscription based revenue cycle and spend and clinical management services through software tools accessed by our clients while the data is hosted and maintained on our servers 
in many arrangements  clients are charged set up fees for implementation and monthly subscription fees for access to these web based hosted services 
implementation fees are typically billed at the beginning of the arrangement and recognized as revenue over the greater of the subscription period or the estimated customer relationship period 
we estimate the customer relationship period based on historical customer retention rates 
we currently estimate our customer relationship period to be six years for our hosted services 
revenue from monthly hosting arrangements is recognized on a subscription basis over the period in which the client uses the service 
contract subscription periods typically range from two to six years from execution 
we consistently monitor our customer relationship periods and as a result  our estimated customer relationship period may change due to the changing attrition rates of our clients 
we have historically changed our estimates of customer relationship periods for certain of our web hosted clients 
these changes in estimated customer lives have typically deferred revenue over longer periods 
we finalized a study of our customer relationship period using data based on our historical experience 
as a result of the study  we changed our customer relationship period for which we recognize revenue related to implementation and setup fees charged for our software as a service saas based services from an average of four years to six years  effective january  we will apply this change in estimate on a prospective basis 
we estimate the impact of the change in customer relationship period reduced our other service fee revenue by approximately million  operating income by million and earnings per share by approximately per share 
administrative fee adjustment in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we recorded a net million purchase accounting adjustment that reflects the fair value of administrative fees related to client purchases that occurred prior to november   but were reported to us subsequently 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and recording any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
the purchase accounting adjustment amounted to an estimated million of accounts receivable relating to these administrative fees and an estimated million of related revenue share obligation 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers the following to be important factors that could trigger an impairment review and may result in an impairment charge significant and sustained underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  significant and sustained 
table of contents adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant negative changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period 
we complete our impairment evaluation by performing valuation analyses in accordance with gaap relating to goodwill and other intangibles 
this analysis contains uncertainties because it requires us to make market participant assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability and growth of future business strategies to determine estimated future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
when market prices are not available  we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit or asset group using the income approach and or the market approach 
the income approach uses cash flow projections 
inherent in our development of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  approved business plans  expected growth rates  capital expenditures and cost of capital  similar to those a market participant would use to assess fair value 
we also make certain assumptions about future economic conditions and other data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the fair value measurement of a reporting unit or asset group  and therefore can affect the amount of the impairment 
the following are key assumptions we use in making cash flow projections business projections 
we make assumptions about the demand for our products in the marketplace 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for volume  mix  and pricing 
we also make assumptions about our cost levels 
these projections are derived using our internal business plans that are updated at least annually and reviewed by our board of directors 
long term growth rate 
a growth rate is used to calculate the terminal value of the business  and is added to the present value of the debt free cash flows 
the growth rate is the expected rate at which a business unit s earnings stream is projected to grow beyond the planning period 
discount rate 
when measuring possible impairment  future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use 
weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall risk adjusted after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
economic projections 
assumptions regarding general economic conditions are included in and affect our assumptions regarding industry sales and pricing estimates 
these macro economic assumptions include  but are not limited to  industry sales volumes and interest rates 
our estimates of future cash flows used in these valuations could differ materially from actual results 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
as of december   the estimated fair value of each operating unit within our scm and rcm segments exceeded its respective carrying value by more than 
in addition  we make assumptions about the useful lives of our intangible assets 
intangible assets including our capitalized software are amortized over their useful lives  which have been derived based on an assessment of such factors as attrition  expected volume and economic benefit 
we evaluate the useful lives of our intangible assets on an annual basis 
any changes to our estimated useful lives could cause depreciation and amortization to increase or decrease 

table of contents during  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price and related market capitalization 
if we experience a further decline in our stock price and market capitalization or if we experience unfavorable business trends which could lead to a reduction of expected future cash flows for one or more of our reporting units  we may incur potential impairment charges in future reporting periods 
acquisitions purchase price allocation we adopted revised gaap relating to business combinations as of january  the revised guidance retains the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions but requires a number of changes  including changes in the way assets and liabilities are recognized in purchase accounting 
other changes include requiring the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  requiring the capitalization of in process research and development at fair value  and requiring the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
our purchase price allocation methodology requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
we estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon appraised market values  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
management determines the fair value of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets such as developed technology or customer relationships  and any other significant assets or liabilities 
we adjust the purchase price allocation  as necessary  up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies  and result in an impairment or a new allocation of purchase price 
given our history of acquisitions  we may allocate part of the purchase price of future acquisitions to contingent consideration as required by gaap for business combinations 
the fair value calculation of contingent consideration will involve a number of assumptions that are subjective in nature and which may differ significantly from actual results 
we may experience volatility in our earnings to some degree in future reporting periods as a result of these fair value measurements 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific client s ability to meet its financial obligations to us which would be affected  for example  if such client declared bankruptcy 
other factors include the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record a reserve for specific account balances as well as a general reserve based on our historical experience for bad debt to reduce the related receivables to the amount we expect to collect from clients 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if actual results are inconsistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may experience a higher or lower expense 
in addition  if circumstances related to specific clients change  or economic conditions deteriorate such that our past collection experience is no longer relevant  our estimate of the recoverability of our accounts receivable could be further reduced from the levels provided for in the consolidated financial statements 
our bad debt expense to total net revenue ratio for the fiscal years ended december  and was and or and of other service fee revenue  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to the decline in uncollectible accounts and bankruptcies that occurred during the prior period and to improved internal processes to manage our accounts receivable exposure with respect to clients primarily in our rcm segment 
however  as we continue to expand our services based non gpo revenue  we may experience a higher bad debt expense to total revenue ratio 

table of contents income taxes we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  as needed  based upon historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
our tax valuation allowance requires us to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the forecasted amount and timing of future taxable income 
we estimate the company s effective tax rate based upon the currently enacted tax rates and estimated state apportionment 
this rate is determined based upon location of company personnel  location of company assets and determination of sales on a jurisdictional basis 
we currently file income tax returns in approximately jurisdictions inclusive of certain city jurisdictions 
we recognize excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity when realized 
when assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share based compensation has been realized  we follow the tax law ordering method  under which current year share based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
if tax law does not specify the ordering in a particular circumstance  then a pro rata approach is used 
effective january   we adopted gaap relating to the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting this guidance on january  was recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
upon adoption of this guidance  our policy is to include interest and penalties in our provision for income taxes 
the tax years through remain open to examination by the internal revenue service and certain state taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject 
each quarter we assess our uncertain tax positions and adjust our reserve accordingly based on the most recent facts and circumstances 
if there is a significant change in the underlying facts and circumstances or applicable tax law modifications  we may be exposed to additional benefits or expense 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the impact of uncertain tax positions in we expect a significant increase in our cash taxes in future years  primarily attributable to exhausting all of our federal net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
share based compensation we have a share based compensation plan  which includes non qualified stock options  non vested share awards and stock settled stock appreciation rights 
see note  significant accounting policies  note  stockholders equity and note  share based compensation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our share based compensation programs 
prior to our initial public offering  valuing our share price as a privately held company was complex 
we used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with gaap for privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  in assessing and determining the fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes 
the fair value of our common stock was determined through periodic valuations 
our stock valuations used a combination of the market comparable approach and the income approach to estimate the aggregate enterprise value of our company at each valuation date 
there was a high degree of subjectivity involved in using option pricing models and there was no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates resulting from these valuation models  nor was there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 

table of contents for grants following the initial public offering  we utilized market based share prices of our common stock in the black scholes option pricing model to calculate fair value of our common stock option awards 
this valuation technique will continue to involve highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and estimated forfeitures 
it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price  required by existing accounting requirements based solely on our own historical stock price volatility trading history  given our limited history as a publicly traded company 
once we have sufficient history as a public company  we will calculate the expected volatility of our share price based on our trading history  which may impact our future share based compensation 
in accordance with gaap for stock compensation  we have estimated grant date fair value of our shares using a combination of our own trading history and a volatility calculated calculated volatility from an appropriate industry sector index of comparable entities 
we identified similar public entities for which share and option price information was available  and considered the historical volatilities of those entities share prices in calculating volatility 
dividend payments were not assumed  as we did not anticipate paying a dividend at the dates in which the various option grants occurred during the year 
the risk free rate of return reflects the weighted average interest rate offered for zero coupon treasury bonds over the expected term of the options 
the expected term of the awards represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
based on our limited history  we utilized the simplified method as prescribed in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  to calculate expected term 
for service based equity awards  compensation cost is recognized using an accelerated method over the vesting or service period and is net of estimated forfeitures 
for performance based equity awards  compensation cost is recognized using a straight line method over the vesting or performance period and is adjusted each reporting period in which a change in performance achievement is determined and is net of estimated forfeitures 
we granted certain equity awards under our long term performance incentive plan that included performance based stock settled stock appreciation rights ssars and performance based restricted common stock 
the performance based ssars only vest upon the achievement of a compounded annual growth rate of diluted adjusted eps for the three year period ending december  the performance based restricted common stock awards vest in increments depending on the level of achievement in compounded annual growth rate of diluted adjusted eps for the three year period ending december  during  we reversed million of previously recorded share based compensation expense related to the performance based ssars and performance based restricted stock that were granted under the medassets  inc long term performance incentive plan in the share based compensation expense was reversed due to non achievement of certain performance criteria 
we assess the probability of achievement of the performance targets relating to performance based equity awards on a quarterly basis 
if during any reporting period under the related vesting term we conclude that we are unable to achieve the performance targets relating to these equity awards  we will reverse the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in prior periods 
this may amount to a significant change in our share based compensation expense in future periods if it is not probable that we will achieve these performance targets 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements involve payment of ordinary expenses  working capital fluctuations  debt service obligations and capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures typically consist of software purchases  internal product development capitalization and computer hardware purchases 
historically  the acquisition of complementary businesses has resulted in a significant use of cash 
our principal sources of funds have primarily been cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we believe we currently have adequate cash flow from operations  capital resources  available credit facilities and liquidity to meet our cash flow requirements including the following near term obligations next months i our working capital needs  ii our debt service obligations  iii our million deferred purchase payment relating to the broadlane acquisition due on january  see further details below  
table of contents iv planned capital expenditures  v our revenue share obligation and rebate payments  and vi estimated federal and state income tax payments 
on january   we paid the million deferred purchase consideration due to the former owners of the broadlane group as part of the acquisition completed in november we funded the deferred payment with cash  which included a million draw on our million revolving credit facility 
in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement with barclays bank plc and jp morgan securities llc 
the credit agreement consists of a six year million senior secured term loan facility and a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility that contains a letter of credit sub facility of million and a swing line sub facility of million 
on march   we entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement to redefine the swing line lender as bank of america  na from barclays bank 
also in connection with the broadlane acquisition  we closed the offering of an aggregate principal amount of million of senior notes due the notes 
the notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of the company s existing domestic subsidiaries and each of the company s future domestic restricted subsidiaries in each case that guarantees the company s obligations under the credit agreement 
each of the subsidiary guarantors is owned by the company  the guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are full and unconditional  the guarantees by the subsidiary guarantors are joint and several  the company has no independent assets or operations  and any subsidiaries of the company other than the subsidiary guarantors are minor 
the notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the company and the subsidiary guarantors  respectively 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of november  the indenture among the company  its subsidiary guarantors and wells fargo bank  na  as trustee 
pursuant to the indenture  the notes will mature on november  and bear annual interest 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  beginning on may  historically  we have utilized federal net operating loss carryforwards for both regular and alternative minimum tax payment purposes 
consequently  our federal cash tax payments in past reporting periods have been minimal 
as a result of tax accounting method changes  we have realized additional net operating losses and certain tax attributes to utilize for as a result  we expect our cash tax payments to remain low  comparable to previous tax years 
however  for tax years and later  we expect our cash paid for taxes to increase significantly 
we have not historically utilized borrowings available under our existing credit agreement to fund operations 
we implemented an auto borrowing plan which caused all excess cash on hand to be used to repay our swing line credit facility on a daily basis 
as we changed lenders in the course of the broadlane acquisition  this practice was suspended 
on march   we re instituted this practice by amending our credit agreement and assigning the entire swing line component of our revolving credit facility to our former lender 
as a result  any excess cash on hand will be used to repay our swing line balance  if any  on a daily basis 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
as of december   we had zero dollars drawn on our revolving credit facility resulting in million of availability under our revolving credit facility inclusive of the swing line netted for a million letter of credit 
we may observe fluctuations in cash flows provided by operations from period to period 
certain events may cause us to draw additional amounts under our swing line or revolving facility and may include the following changes in working capital due to inconsistent timing of cash receipts and payments for major recurring items such as trade accounts payable  revenue share obligation  incentive compensation  changes in deferred revenue  and other various items  transaction and integration related costs associated with the broadlane acquisition  acquisitions  and unforeseeable events or transactions 

table of contents we may continue to pursue other acquisitions or investments in the future 
we may also increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure  software solutions  and personnel  and as we expand our market presence 
cash provided by operating activities may not be sufficient to fund such expenditures 
accordingly  in addition to the use of our available revolving credit facility  we may need to engage in additional equity or debt financings to secure additional funds for such purposes 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters including higher interest costs  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be limited 
discussion of cash flow as of december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million  respectively 
operating activities the following table summarizes the cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal years ended december  and fiscal year ended december  change amount amount amount in millions net loss non cash items net changes in working capital net cash provided by operations net loss income represents the loss or profitability attained during the periods presented and is inclusive of certain non cash expenses 
these non cash expenses include depreciation for fixed assets  amortization of intangible assets  stock compensation expense  bad debt expense  deferred income tax expense  excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options  loss on sale of assets  amortization of debt issuance costs  impairment of intangibles and non cash interest expense 
refer to our consolidated statement of cash flows for details regarding these non cash items 
the total for these non cash expenses was million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in non cash expenses for the fiscal year ended december  compared to december  was primarily attributable to i an increase in depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangibles primarily associated with the assets acquired in the broadlane acquisition  ii an increase in the amortization of debt issuance costs primarily associated with financing the broadlane acquisition  and iii an increase in noncash interest expense primarily associated with our deferred payment for the broadlane acquisition 
the increase was partially offset by i a decrease in impairment of intangibles  ii a decrease in bad debt expense  and iii a decrease in share based compensation for the reasons described under key considerations 
refer to our management discussion and analysis for more detail 
working capital is a measure of our liquid assets

investing activities investing activities used million of cash for the fiscal year ended december  which included million for investment in software development  and million of capital expenditures 
the increase in cash used for investing activities compared to the prior year was primarily due to i investments in software development in connection with combining the operations of broadlane with our existing operations  ii rcm software development primarily due to new product features and functionality  new technologies  and upgrades to our service offerings  and iii investments in computer hardware associated with increased infrastructure demands 

table of contents investing activities used million of cash for the fiscal year ended december  which included million related to the broadlane acquisition  million for investment in software development  and million of capital expenditures that were primarily related to the growth in our rcm segment 
we believe that cash used in investing activities will continue to be materially impacted by continued growth in investments in property and equipment  future acquisitions and capitalized software

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading finance obligations for additional information regarding this transaction and the related obligation 

table of contents effective january   we adopted gaap relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the above amount relates to management s estimate of uncertain tax positions 
as a result of tax attributes net operating losses and tax credits  we have several tax periods open to examination until the statute of limitations has expired with respect to the year in which these attributes are utilized 
as such  we cannot predict the precise timing that this liability will be applied or utilized 
additionally  the liability may increase or decrease if management s estimate of uncertain tax positions changes when new information arises or changes in circumstances occur 
indemnification of product users 
we provide a limited indemnification to users of our products against any patent  copyright  or trade secret claims brought against them 
the duration of the indemnifications vary based upon the life of the specific individual agreements 
we have not had a material indemnification claim  and we do not believe we will have a material claim in the future 
as such  we have not recorded any liability for these indemnification obligations in our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have provided a million letter of credit to guarantee our performance under the terms of a ten year lease agreement 
the letter of credit is associated with the capital lease of a building located in cape girardeau  missouri under a finance obligation 
we do not believe that this letter of credit will be drawn 
we lease office space and equipment under operating leases 
some of these operating leases include rent escalations  rent holidays  and rent concessions and incentives 
however  we recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term utilizing total future minimum lease payments 
as of december   we did not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future significant effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board in its financial and operational decision making  we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis herein with the following non gaap financial measures gross fees  gross administrative fees  revenue share obligation  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  acquisition affected net revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
we compensate for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only supplementally 
we provide reconciliations of non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures  where possible 
investors are encouraged to carefully review those reconciliations 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by us  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
gross fees  gross administrative fees and revenue share obligation 
gross fees include all gross administrative fees we receive pursuant to our vendor contracts and all other fees we receive from clients 
our revenue share obligation represents the portion of the gross administrative fees we are contractually obligated to share with certain of our gpo clients 
total net revenue a gaap measure reflects our gross fees net of our revenue share obligation 
these non gaap measures assist management and the board and may be helpful to investors in analyzing our growth in the spend management segment given that administrative fees constitute a material portion of our revenue and are paid to us by over  vendors contracted by our gpo  and that our revenue share obligation constitutes a significant outlay to certain of our gpo clients 
a reconciliation of these non gaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the overview and results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 

table of contents ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin 
we define i ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and other non recurring  non cash or non operating items  and iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue 
we use ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing our operating performance consistently over time as it removes the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges and amortization of debt issuance costs  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the management team taxes  as well as other non cash purchase accounting adjustments  and imputed rental income and non recurring items  from our operational results 
adjusted ebitda also removes the impact of non cash share based compensation expense 
our board and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive incentive compensation programs  as well as for incentive compensation plans for employees generally 
additionally  research analysts  investment bankers and lenders may use these measures to assess our operating performance 
for example  our credit agreement requires delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are  in part  based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is similar to the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and our board 
the principal difference is that the measurement of adjusted ebitda considered by our lenders under our credit agreement allows for certain adjustments eg  inclusion of interest income  franchise taxes and other non cash expenses  offset by the deduction of our capitalized lease payments for one of our office leases that result in a higher adjusted ebitda than the adjusted ebitda measure reviewed by our board and management and disclosed in our annual report on form k 
additionally  our credit agreement contains provisions that utilize other measures  such as excess cash flow  to measure liquidity 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin  as disclosed herein  have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  we encourage you to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere herein  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
we also strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda in this section  along with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 

table of contents the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  a comparable gaap based measure 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to ebitda to adjusted ebitda are either i non cash items eg  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangibles and share based compensation expense or ii items that management does not consider in assessing our on going operating performance eg  income taxes  interest expense and expenses related to the cancellation of an interest rate swap and acquisition and integration related expenses 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 
the following table reconciles net income to adjusted ebitda for the fiscal years ended december   and fiscal year ended december  adjusted ebitda reconciliation in thousands net loss income depreciation depreciation included in cost of revenue amortization of intangibles amortization of intangibles included in cost of revenue interest expense  net of interest income income tax benefit expense ebitda impairment of intangibles share based compensation expense rcm management restructuring expenses rental income from capitalizing building lease purchase accounting adjustments acquisition and integration related expenses insurance settlement adjusted ebitda interest income is included in other income expense and is not netted against interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
during  we terminated an interest rate swap as part of the broadlane acquisition that was originally set to terminate in march in consideration of the early termination  we paid the swap counterparty  and incurred an expense of  million for the fiscal year ended december  that termination amount is included in interest expense for the fiscal year ended december  the impairment during the fiscal year ended december  primarily consisted of i a million write off of goodwill relating to our decision support services operating unit  and ii million relating to an scm trade name and a customer base intangible asset from prior acquisitions that were deemed to be impaired as part of the product and service offering integration associated with the broadlane acquisition 
represents non cash share based compensation to both employees and directors 
we believe excluding this non cash expense allows us to compare our operating performance without regard to the impact of share based compensation expense  which varies from period to period based on the amount and timing of grants 

table of contents amount represents restructuring costs consisting of severance that resulted from certain management changes within our rcm segment 
the imputed rental income recognized with respect to a capitalized building lease is deducted from net loss income due to its non cash nature 
we believe this income is not a useful measure of continuing operating performance 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements herein for further discussion of this rental income 
upon acquiring broadlane on november   we made certain purchase accounting adjustments that reflect the fair value of administrative fees related to client purchases that occurred prior to november  but were reported to us subsequent to that 
under our revenue recognition accounting policy  which is in accordance with gaap  these administrative fees would be ordinarily recorded as revenue when reported to us  however  the acquisition method of accounting requires us to estimate the amount of purchases occurring prior to the transaction date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees to be received from those purchases as an account receivable as opposed to recognizing revenue when these transactions are reported to us and recording any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
for the fiscal year ended december   the million represents the net amount of i approximately million in gross administrative fees and other service fees primarily based on vendor reporting received from january  through november  relating to purchases made prior to the acquisition date  and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million relating to the same period 
for the fiscal year ended december   the million represents the net amount of i million in administrative fees based on vendor reporting received from the acquisition date up through december   and ii a corresponding revenue share obligation of million

spend and clinical resource management scm acquisition affected net revenue 
scm acquisition affected net revenue includes the revenue of broadlane prior to the company s actual ownership 
although the broadlane acquisition was consummated on november   this measure assumes the acquisition of broadlane occurred on january  broadlane acquisition related adjustment includes the historical results of broadlane s operations from january  through november   inclusive of certain purchase accounting adjustments 
broadlane purchase accounting revenue adjustment reflects an estimated reduction of 
table of contents net administrative fee revenue 
under the company s revenue recognition policies  administrative fees are recorded as revenue when reported to the company by vendors 
gaap relating to business combinations requires that the company estimate the amount of customer supply purchases the driver of administrative fee revenue occurring prior to the acquisition closing date and to record the fair value of the administrative fees the asset to be received from those purchases as an account receivable and any corresponding revenue share obligation as a liability 
as vendor reports are received and cash is collected  the company will not recognize revenue for this acquisition related purchase accounting revenue adjustment 
scm acquisition affected net revenue is used by management and the board to better understand the extent of growth of the scm segment 
given the significant impact that the broadlane acquisition had on the company during the fiscal year ended december  and will have in future periods  we believe this measure may be useful and meaningful to investors in their analysis of such growth 
scm acquisition affected net revenue is presented for illustrative and informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or be indicative of what our results of operations would have been if this transaction had occurred at the beginning of this measure also should not be considered representative of our future results of operations 
reconciliations of scm acquisition affected net revenue to its most directly comparable gaap measure can be found in the results of operations section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
adjusted net income and diluted adjusted earnings per share 
the company defines i adjusted net income as net income excluding non cash acquisition related intangible amortization  nonrecurring expense items on a tax adjusted basis and non cash tax adjusted shared based compensation expense  and ii diluted adjusted eps which we formerly referred to as non gaap diluted cash eps as diluted earnings per share excluding non cash acquisition related intangible amortization  nonrecurring expense items on a tax adjusted basis and non cash tax adjusted shared based compensation expense 
adjusted net income and diluted adjusted eps are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities 
diluted adjusted eps growth is used by the company as the financial performance metric that determines whether certain equity awards granted pursuant to the company s long term performance incentive plan will vest 
use of these measures allows management and the board to analyze the company s operating performance on a consistent basis by removing the impact of certain non cash and non recurring items from our operations and reward organic growth and accretive business transactions 
as a significant portion of senior management s incentive based compensation is based on the achievement of certain diluted adjusted eps growth over time  investors may find such information useful  however  as non gaap financial measures  adjusted net income and diluted adjusted eps are not the sole measures of the company s financial performance and may not be the best measures for investors to gauge such performance

new accounting pronouncements intangibles goodwill and other in september  the fasb issued an accounting standards update amending the guidance on the annual testing of goodwill for impairment 
the update will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
the update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update relating to the timing of step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts

the update was effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  
table of contents comprehensive income in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standard update relating to comprehensive income 
the update would require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
the update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  fair value in may  the fasb issued an accounting standard update relating to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the update provides a consistent definition of fair value and ensures that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements of gaap and the international financial reporting standards are similar 
the update changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
the update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  business combinations in december  the fasb issued an accounting standards update relating to supplemental pro forma information for business combinations and expanding the related disclosures 
if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the update was effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the update will only affect us if we execute future business combinations 
revenue recognition in april  the fasb issued new standards for vendors who apply the milestone method of revenue recognition to research and development arrangements 
these new standards apply to arrangements with payments that are contingent  at inception  upon achieving substantively uncertain future events or circumstances 
the guidance is applicable for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  the adoption of this guidance impacts our arrangements with one time or non recurring performance fees that are contingent upon achieving certain results 
historically  we had recognized these types of performance fees in the period in which the respective performance target had been met 
effective january   one time or non recurring performance fees are recognized proportionately over the contract term 
we will continue to recognize recurring performance fees in the period in which they are earned 
we adopted this update on january  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an accounting standards update for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the update addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
the update also addresses how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments in the update significantly expand the disclosures related to a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements with the objective of providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and how the application of the relative selling price method of determining stand alone value affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
certain of our contracts are denominated in canadian dollars 
as our canadian sales have not historically been significant to our operations  we do not believe that changes in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar will have a significant impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
on august   we entered into a series of forward contracts to fix the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rates on a canadian client contract 
the forward contracts expired on april  we have one other canadian dollar contract that we have not elected to hedge 
we currently do not transact any other business in any currency other than the us dollar 
as we continue to grow our operations  we may increase the amount of our sales to foreign clients 
although we do not expect foreign currency exchange risk to have a significant impact on our future operations  we will assess the risk on a case specific basis to determine whether any forward currency hedge instrument would be warranted 
interest rate risk 
we had outstanding borrowings on our term loan of million as of december  the term loan bears interest at libor  subject to a floor of plus an applicable margin 
we also had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of our notes of million as of december   which bears interest at per annum 
due to the additional indebtedness we incurred under the credit agreement and in connection with the issuance of the notes  we expect to incur a significant increase in our interest expense in future periods 
to the extent we do not hedge it  we expect our interest rate risk to rise accordingly 
as required by our credit agreement  we entered into certain derivative instruments during may to convert a portion of our variable rate term loan facility to a fixed rate debt 
refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
a hypothetical basis point increase in libor  which would represent potential interest rate change exposure on our outstanding term loan  would have resulted in a million increase to our interest expense for the fiscal year ended december
