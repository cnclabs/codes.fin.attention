item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  we recognize contract revenue using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract revenue is recognized by applying the percentage of completion of the contract for the period based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs of a contract to the total estimated revenue for the contract 
estimated contract losses are recognized in full when determined 
contract revenue and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised on a continuous basis as the work progresses and as change orders are initiated or approved  and adjustments based upon the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenue in the accounting period when these estimates are revised 
to the extent that these adjustments result in an increase  a reduction or an elimination of previously reported contract profit  we recognize a credit or a charge against current earnings  which could be material 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future for working capital  capital expenditures and or acquisitions  and we may not be able to do so on favorable terms or at all  which would impair our ability to operate our business or achieve our growth objectives 
our ability to obtain additional financing in the future will depend in part upon prevailing credit and equity market conditions  as well as conditions in our business and our operating results  such factors may adversely affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms satisfactory to us 
we have pledged the proceeds and other rights under our construction contracts to our bond surety  and we have pledged substantially all of our other assets as collateral in connection with our credit facility and mortgage debt 
as a result  we may have difficulty in obtaining additional financing in the future if such financing requires us to pledge assets as collateral 
in addition  under our credit facility  we must obtain the consent of our lenders to incur any amount of additional debt from other sources subject to certain exceptions 
if future financing is obtained by the issuance of additional shares of common stock  our stockholders may suffer dilution 
if adequate funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  we may not be able to make future investments  take advantage of acquisitions or other opportunities  or respond to competitive challenges 

table of contents we are subject to financial and other covenants under our credit facility that could limit our flexibility in managing our business 
we have a credit facility that restricts us from engaging in certain activities  including our ability subject to certain exceptions to make distributions  pay dividends and buy back shares  incur liens or encumbrances  incur other indebtedness  guarantee obligations  dispose of a material portion of assets  engage in a merger with a third party  and make acquisitions 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that require us to maintain specified fixed charge coverage ratios  asset ratios and leverage ratios  and to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth 
our ability to borrow funds for any purpose will depend on our satisfying these tests 
if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or fail to comply with any of the other restrictions contained in our credit facility  an event of default could occur 
an event of default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of any outstanding indebtedness  causing such debt to become immediately due and payable 
if such acceleration occurs  we may not be able to repay such indebtedness on a timely basis 
acceleration of our credit facility could result in foreclosure on and loss of our operating assets 
in the event of such foreclosure  we would be unable to conduct our business and forced to discontinue operations 
if we were required to write down all or part of our goodwill  our net earnings and net worth could be materially and adversely affected 
we had approximately million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at december  goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations reduced by any impairments recorded subsequent to the date of acquisition 
a shortfall in our revenues or net income or changes in various other factors from that expected by securities analysts and investors could significantly reduce the market price of our common stock 
if our market capitalization drops significantly below the amount of net equity recorded on our balance sheet  it might indicate a decline in our fair value and would require us to further evaluate whether our goodwill has been impaired 
we perform an annual review of our goodwill and intangible assets to determine if they have become impaired  which would require us to write down the impaired portion of these assets 
on an interim basis  we also review the factors that have or may affect our operations or market capitalization for events that may trigger impairment testing 
in  our annual review indicated that goodwill was impaired  and as a result we recorded a charge of million representing approximately of the million of recorded goodwill prior to the write down 
as a result  the company incurred a significant loss for and equity declined by million 
if we were required to write down all or a significant part of our goodwill in future periods  our net earnings and equity could be materially and adversely affected
