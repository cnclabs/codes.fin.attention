table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated or implied in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under item a  risk factors  and elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop tiny  sustained release  drug delivery products designed to deliver drugs at a controlled and steady rate for months or years 
we are focused on treatment of chronic diseases of the back of the eye utilizing our core technology platforms  durasert and biosilicon 
we currently have three approved products and two principal product candidates under development  which represent successive generations of our durasert technology platform 
we have developed three of the four sustained release devices for treatment of retinal diseases currently approved in the us or the european union eu 
iluvien 
our most recently approved product iluvien is an injectable  sustained release micro insert delivering the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide fac over a period of up to years for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic diabetic macular edema dme considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies 
iluvien is being developed by our licensee alimera sciences  inc alimera 
iluvien has received marketing authorization in the united kingdom  austria  france  germany and portugal  and marketing authorization is pending in italy and spain 
the international diabetes federation has estimated that approximately million people in these seven countries have diabetes  of which alimera has estimated that approximately million suffer from vision loss associated with dme 
alimera has announced its intention to proceed with the direct commercialization of iluvien in germany  the uk and france in to date  alimera has not received marketing approval for iluvien in the us following receipt of a complete response letter in november crl from the us food and drug administration fda  and based on a meeting with the fda in june  alimera has reported that it intends to resubmit its new drug application nda for iluvien for dme in early alimera further reported that it intends to include additional analysis of the benefits and risks of iluvien based upon the clinical data from its two previously completed pivotal phase iii clinical trials fame study and to focus on the population of patients for which regulatory approval has been granted in the various eu countries 
product development 
we are pursuing the treatment of chronic non infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye posterior uveitis as another indication for the same injectable micro insert used in iluvien 
we did not license this indication to alimera 
the fda has cleared our investigational new drug application ind  permitting us to move directly to two phase iii trials for this indication without the necessity of first conducting phase i or phase ii trials 
the fda has agreed that the primary end point in these trials will be recurrence of uveitis within months and that we can reference much of the data  including the clinical safety data  from the clinical trials for iluvien for dme 
we plan to enroll a total of approximately patients in our clinical trials and to utilize an inserter with a different design and a smaller gauge needle than the planned commercial inserter for iluvien for dme 
because this micro insert delivers the same drug as our approved retisert product for posterior uveitis  we expect these trials will show efficacy 
further  as the same micro insert was used in the iluvien trials  we expect to observe a side effect profile in uveitis patients comparable to that seen in dme patients 
as a result  we are optimistic that this micro insert will be efficacious for posterior uveitis with a favorable risk benefit profile and fewer side effects compared to retisert 
an investigator sponsored phase i ii study of the safety and efficacy of this micro insert for the treatment of posterior uveitis is ongoing 

table of contents we are developing a bioerodible  injectable micro insert delivering latanoprost the latanoprost product to treat glaucoma and ocular hypertension 
an investigator sponsored phase i ii dose escalation study has been initiated to assess the safety and efficacy of this micro insert in patients with elevated intraocular pressure iop 
we have granted to pfizer  inc an exclusive option under various circumstances to license the worldwide development and commercialization of the latanoprost product for the treatment of human ophthalmic disease or conditions other than uveitis 
we are investigating the use of durasert technology for the treatment of orthopedic diseases 
biosilicon 
the second key technology platform we are targeting is biosilicon  which uses fully erodible  nanostructured  porous material for sustained drug delivery 
our primary focus is on tethadur  an application of biosilicon technology designed to provide sustained delivery of large biologic molecules  including proteins  antibodies and peptides 
the sizes of the pores in the biosilicon material are manufactured using nanotechnology to accommodate specific protein  peptide or antibody molecules that are then released on a sustained basis over time as the material bioerodes 
our biosilicon technology can also be designed to deliver smaller molecules 
we are investigating the use of biosilicon in our latanoprost product and the use of tethadur in other ophthalmic applications 
fda approved products 
our two fda approved products utilize two earlier generations of our durasert technology system and are surgically implanted 
second generation retisert delivers fac to provide sustained release treatment of posterior uveitis for approximately two and a half years  and first generation vitrasert delivers ganciclovir to provide sustained release treatment of aids related cytomegalovirus cmv retinitis for six to nine months 
we licensed both of these products to bausch lomb 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience  anticipated results and trends and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
by their nature  these estimates  judgments and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and management evaluates them on an ongoing basis for changes in facts and circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
it is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies discussed below 
revenue recognition our business strategy includes entering into collaborative license and development agreements for the development and commercialization of product candidates utilizing our technology systems 
the terms of these arrangements typically include multiple deliverables by us for example  granting of license rights  providing research and development services and manufacturing of clinical materials  participating on joint research committee in exchange for consideration to us of some combination of non refundable license fees  funding of 
table of contents research and development activities  payments based upon achievement of clinical development  regulatory and sales milestones and royalties in the form of a designated percentage of product sales or profits 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and based on the selling price of the deliverables 
when deliverables are separable  consideration received is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price of the elements and the appropriate revenue recognition principles are applied to each unit 
the assessment of multiple deliverable arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate units of accounting  the estimated selling price of each unit of accounting  and the points in time that  or periods over which  revenue should be recognized 
for the year ended june   we reported million of collaborative research and development revenue 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we prospectively adopted the provisions of asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu for new and materially modified arrangements originating on or after july  asu requires a vendor to allocate revenue to each unit of accounting in arrangements involving multiple deliverables 
it changes the level of evidence of standalone selling price required to separate deliverables by allowing a vendor to make its best estimate of the standalone selling price of deliverables when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of selling price is not available 
as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  adoption of this accounting pronouncement in fiscal resulted in the recognition of revenue in connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer that became subject to the new accounting pronouncement after a material modification to the agreement occurred 
as a result of the adoption of asu  deferred revenues associated with this pfizer agreement will be recognized as revenues earlier than would otherwise have occurred 
our deliverables under the restated pfizer agreement include conducting the research and development program for the latanoprost product through completion of phase ii the r d program and participation on a joint steering committee jsc 
we concluded that the pfizer exercise option for the worldwide exclusive license is not a deliverable of the arrangement  due to it being a substantive option and not being priced at a significant and incremental discount 
we determined that the jsc does not have standalone value from the r d program and therefore we combined these deliverables into a single unit of accounting 
the total arrangement consideration of the restated pfizer agreement totaled million  which consisted of the million of deferred revenue on our balance sheet at the effective date plus the million upfront payment 
the difference between the total arrangement consideration and the estimated selling price of the combined deliverables  or million  was recognized as collaborative research and development revenue in the quarter ended june   the period of the modification 
to determine the estimated selling price of the combined deliverable  we applied an estimated margin to our cost projections for the combined deliverable 
a change in the estimated margin or our cost projections would have directly impacted the amount of revenue recognized during fiscal an increase of in our estimated selling price of the combined deliverables would have reduced revenue recognized in fiscal by  and would have increased the amount of deferred revenue recognized in fiscal by  or  valuation of intangible assets at december   we recorded a million intangible asset impairment write down of our durasert and biosilicon technology systems 
following the november public announcement of the crl  there 
table of contents was a significant decline in the company s share price  resulting in a decrease of the company s market capitalization from million to million at december  the combination of the crl and the decline in the company s share price were determined to be impairment indicators of the company s finite lived intangible assets 
to assess the recoverability of the combined intangible assets which had a carrying value of million at december   we used a combination of market based and income based valuation methodologies 
using the market based approach as the primary indicator of fair value  an enterprise value of million market capitalization less existing capital resources was adjusted for an estimated control premium and for other working capital items to derive an implied fair value of the intangible assets of million 
under the income based approach  the forecasted cash flows expected for the intangible assets were discounted using after tax cost of capital rates taking into account company specific risks 
the resulting fair value under this approach supported the conclusions of the market based approach 
based on these analyses  the fair value of the combined intangible assets was allocated to each intangible based on values determined under the income based approach  resulting in an million write down of the biosilicon intangible and a million write down of the durasert intangible 
at june   we reported million of intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  which consisted of million related to durasert and million related to biosilicon 
we amortize these intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which currently extend through calendar year and is expected to result in a charge to operations of approximately  per year 
we believe that the carrying value of our intangible assets will be recouped primarily through expected net cash flows from our existing collaboration agreements described under license and collaboration agreements above or through other licensing or commercialization 
we will continue to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be fully recoverable or that the useful life of the asset is no longer appropriate 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following change relative to historical or projected future operating results  modification or termination of our existing collaboration agreements  factors affecting the development of products utilizing the intangible assets  changes in the expected use of the intangible assets or the strategy for the overall business  and industry or economic trends and developments 
if an impairment trigger is identified  we determine recoverability of an intangible asset by comparing projected undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  and the carrying value is adjusted 
estimated future undiscounted cash flows  which relate to existing contractual agreements as well as projected cash flows from future research and development collaboration agreements utilizing the underlying technology systems  require management s judgment regarding future events and probabilities 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
future adverse changes or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge with respect to some or all of the carrying value of our intangible assets 
such an impairment charge could materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
a significant change in the estimation of the projected undiscounted net cash flows for the products and product candidates utilizing the durasert or biosilicon technology systems  among other things  could result in the further impairment of the carrying value of the respective assets 

table of contents results of operations years ended june  and year ended june  change amounts in thousands except percentages revenues operating expenses research and development general and administrative impairment of intangible assets   na total operating expenses operating loss other income expense change in fair value of derivatives interest income other expense  net total other income loss before income taxes income tax benefit net loss revenues we recognized total revenue of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a million decrease in collaborative research and development revenue  partially offset by a  increase in royalty income 
collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal of million consisted primarily of recognition of  related to the june restated pfizer agreement and million resulting from the termination of a field of use license 
this compares to million of collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal  which was predominantly associated with the restated pfizer agreement 
at the effective date of the restated pfizer agreement  we had million of deferred revenue from the original pfizer agreement on our balance sheet  and we received million of upfront consideration 
the million balance of pfizer deferred revenue at june   after initial revenue recognition of million  is being recognized as revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated period of our performance obligations the latanoprost product research program under the restated pfizer agreement 
of the remaining pfizer deferred revenue balance of million at june   approximately million is currently expected to be recognized as revenue during fiscal substantially all of our royalty income in fiscal and fiscal was from sales of retisert 
our retisert royalty income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal despite this increase  we do not expect that royalty income from bausch lomb for retisert or for vitrasert will be a material source of revenues for us  and it may decline 
research and development research and development increased by  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel costs and the absence in fiscal of a federal therapeutic discovery grant received in fiscal  substantially offset by decreased amortization of 
table of contents intangible assets in fiscal resulting from a million intangible asset impairment write down at december  we may significantly increase our research and development expense in fiscal  primarily dependent upon whether and when we initiate internally funded pivotal clinical trials of our sustained release micro insert to treat patients with posterior uveitis or phase ii clinical trials for the latanoprost product 
general and administrative general and administrative costs decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily attributable to decreased stock based compensation including performance stock option forfeitures  professional fees and the absence in fiscal of cash incentive compensation  payment of which is subject to future conditions 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives represented income of  for fiscal compared to income of million for fiscal warrants denominated in a were recorded as derivative liabilities  subject to revaluation at subsequent reporting dates 
fiscal income from the change in fair value of derivatives  determined using the black scholes valuation model  was predominantly due to the expiration of approximately million  or  of the a denominated warrants during that year 
the derivative liabilities balance was reduced to zero during fiscal in connection with the july expiration of our last remaining a denominated warrants  with the result that we will not recognize income or loss relating to the change in the fair value of derivatives from these warrants in the future 
income tax benefit income tax benefit decreased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily attributable to the absence in fiscal of a net reduction of deferred tax liabilities and federal alternative minimum tax expense in fiscal  partially offset by higher foreign research and development tax credits 
years ended june  and year ended june  change amounts in thousands except percentages revenues operating expenses research and development general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss income other income expense change in fair value of derivatives interest income other expense  net total other income expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net loss income 
table of contents revenues we recognized total revenue of million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a million decrease in collaborative research and development revenue  partially offset by an  increase in royalty income 
collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal of million was predominantly related to the june restated pfizer agreement discussed above 
collaborative research and development revenue for fiscal was predominantly attributable to million recognized in connection with our amended collaboration agreement with alimera 
the alimera revenue consisted of i the payment in full by alimera of a million conditional note plus interest in april and ii million of revenue related to recognition of up front license consideration  reimbursement of our development costs and receipt of conditional note interest payments through the december  end date of our performance obligations under the restated agreement 
for fiscal  we earned million of retisert royalties 
for fiscal  we recognized  in retisert royalty income and million of retisert royalties otherwise payable to us were retained by bausch lomb as the result of a advance payment from bausch lomb  thereby completing an advance royalty agreement 
retisert royalty income for fiscal represented a decrease compared to the aggregate of fiscal royalty income and amounts retained by bausch lomb 
research and development research and development decreased by  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a federal therapeutic discovery grant  partially offset by a small increase in research and development costs 
general and administrative general and administrative costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily attributable to increased stock based compensation and professional fees 
change in fair value of derivatives change in fair value of derivatives represented income of million for fiscal compared to expense of  for fiscal the change in fair value of derivatives for fiscal was predominantly due to the expiration of approximately of the a denominated warrants during the year 
the corresponding net expense in fiscal was primarily due to a substantial increase in the market price of our shares in fiscal resulting in a smaller spread between the market price and the us equivalent exercise prices of the warrants  partially offset by the decrease in the weighted average remaining life of the underlying warrants during the period 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit of  in fiscal compares to  of income tax expense for fiscal  primarily attributable to a net reduction of deferred tax liabilities 
inflation and seasonality our management believes inflation has not had a material impact on our operations or financial condition and that our operations are not currently subject to seasonal influences 

table of contents recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements new accounting pronouncements are issued periodically by the financial accounting standards board fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates 
unless otherwise disclosed below  we believe that the impact of recently issued and adopted pronouncements will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income that will require a company to present components of net income loss and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income loss or other comprehensive income under current gaap 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we are not adopting the standard early and it is applicable for our fiscal quarter beginning july  we have not yet determined which method we will elect to present comprehensive income under the new standard 
other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources during the period of fiscal through fiscal  we financed our operations primarily from license fees  research and development funding and contingent cash payments from our collaboration partners and a january registered direct offering of our equity securities 
at june   our principal source of liquidity consisted of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
in august  we enhanced our cash resources through the sale  in a registered direct offering  of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
our cash equivalents are invested in institutional money market funds  and our marketable securities are invested in investment grade corporate debt  commercial paper and certificates of deposit with maturities at june  ranging from zero to nine months 
with the exception of fiscal  we have incurred operating losses since inception and  at june   we had a total accumulated deficit of million 
we generally expect negative cash flows from operations on a quarterly basis at least until such time as we receive sufficient revenues from iluvien for dme or one or more of our products or product candidates achieves regulatory approval and provides us sufficient revenues 
we believe that our capital resources of million at june   together with the million net proceeds of our august share offering and expected royalty income from bausch lomb should enable us to fund our operations as currently planned through the end of calendar year whether we will require  or desire  to raise additional capital will be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to whether  when and to what extent we receive revenues from alimera with respect to iluvien for dme  including from commercialization in the eu or upon any approval or commercialization in the us  whether and when we are able to enter into strategic arrangements for our product candidates and the nature of those arrangements  when and if we initiate  how we conduct  and whether and the extent to which we internally fund product development and programs  including clinical trials for the posterior uveitis micro insert and the latanoprost product and ongoing research and development of biosilicon technology applications  whether and when pfizer exercises its option with respect to the latanoprost product  timely and successful development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our products and product candidates  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing any patent claims  and changes in our operating plan resulting in increases or decreases in our need for capital 

table of contents absent adequate levels of funding from new collaboration agreements and or financing transactions  management currently believes that our cash position beyond calendar year depends significantly on possible revenues from the successful commercialization by alimera of iluvien for dme in the eu and if iluvien for dme were to be approved by the fda and successfully commercialized in the us however  there is no assurance that the fda or other additional regulatory authorities will approve iluvien for dme  that it will achieve market acceptance in any market or that we will receive significant  if any  revenues from iluvien for dme 
exercise by pfizer of its option for the latanoprost product would also enhance our cash position  although there is no assurance when the option will become exercisable or if pfizer will exercise it 
we enhanced our capital resources in the first quarter of fiscal  raising net proceeds of million through a registered direct offering of common stock and warrants 
if we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital in the future  we do not know if it will be available when needed or on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
the state of the economy and the financial and credit markets at the time we seek additional financing may make it more difficult and more expensive to obtain 
if available  additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  debt financing may involve restrictive covenants or other unfavorable terms and potential dilutive equity  and funding through collaboration agreements may be on unfavorable terms  including requiring us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
if adequate financing is not available if and when needed  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate research or development programs  postpone or cancel the pursuit of product candidates  including pre clinical and clinical trials and new business opportunities  reduce staff and operating costs or otherwise significantly curtail our operations to reduce our cash requirements and extend our capital 
our consolidated statements of historical cash flows are summarized as follows year ended june  in thousands net loss income changes in operating assets and liabilities other adjustments to reconcile net loss income to cash flows from operating activities cash flows used in provided by operating activities cash flows provided by used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities 
table of contents sources and uses of operating cash flows for the years ended june   and are summarized as follows year ended june  in thousands operating cash inflows license and collaboration agreements royalty income foreign r d tax credits federal r d grants investment interest received paid operating cash outflows legal and audit fees all other operating cash outflows  net cash flows used in provided by operating activities operating cash inflows for each year consisted primarily of payments received pursuant to license and collaboration agreements  predominantly with alimera and pfizer 
as a percentage of total license and collaboration agreements  amounts attributable to pfizer represented in fiscal and in fiscal and amounts attributable to alimera represented in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal operating cash outflows increased by million  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased personnel costs and professional fees  and increased by  or  from fiscal to fiscal  primarily as a result of increased professional fees 
cash used in investing activities were primarily attributable to maturities and sales of marketable securities  net of purchases  of million for fiscal and to purchases of marketable securities  net of maturities  totaling million for fiscal and million for fiscal purchases of property and equipment totaled  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal net cash flows from financing activities were predominantly attributable to million of gross proceeds from the january registered direct offering of  common shares and  warrants to purchase common shares at a price per unit of  net of million of stock issuance costs 
in addition  cash flows from financing activities included proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants totaling  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that would be material to investors 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total our purchase obligations primarily consist of purchase orders for clinical trial and pre clinical study costs  supplies and other operating needs 
we also have contractual obligations that are variable in nature and  as such  are not included in the above table 
these include agreements with our three executive officers that would require us to make severance payments to them if we terminate their employment without cause or the executives resign for good cause 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to changes in the valuation of derivative liabilities  foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
derivative liabilities during fiscal  approximately million warrants denominated in a expired 
the remaining  a warrants outstanding at june  had a us equivalent exercise price of per share compared to the nasdaq closing price of our common shares at that date and an expiration date of july  at june   the balance of our derivative liabilities was and was determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the change in fair value of derivatives resulted in income of  for fiscal  income of million for fiscal and expense of  for fiscal foreign currency exchange rates we conduct operations in two principal currencies  the us dollar and the pound sterling 
the us dollar is the functional currency for our us operations  and the pound sterling is the functional currency for our uk operations 
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar and pound sterling impact the net operating expenses of our uk operations 
the minimal strengthening of the uk dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted in a net decrease in research and development expense of approximately  all cash and cash equivalents  and most other asset and liability balances  are denominated in each entity s functional currency and  accordingly  we do not consider our statement of operation exposure to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses to be significant 
changes in the foreign exchange rate of the us dollar and pound sterling also impact total stockholders equity 
during fiscal  the relative strengthening of the us dollar in relation to the pound sterling resulted in a net decrease of  in stockholders equity due to the translation of approximately million of net assets of our uk operations  predominantly the biosilicon technology intangible asset  into us dollars 
for every incremental strengthening or weakening of the us dollar at june  in relation to the pound sterling  our stockholders equity at june  would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately 
table of contents interest rates cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to variable interest rates 
we do not consider our exposure to interest rates to be significant
