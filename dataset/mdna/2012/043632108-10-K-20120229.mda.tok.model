item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information concerning our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
at december   our assets consisted primarily of our wholly owned operating subsidiary  monitronics international  inc monitronics 
monitronics on december   we signed and closed an agreement to acquire of the outstanding capital stock of monitronics  through the merger of our wholly owned subsidiary  mono lake merger sub  inc  with and into monitronics  with monitronics surviving such merger 
the cash consideration paid in connection with the merger was  we also assumed approximately  in net debt which we define as the principal amount of such debt less monitronics cash of monitronics 
in connection with the acquisition  monitronics entered into a credit agreement  which provides for a  term loan and a  revolving credit facility 
ascent capital has guaranteed payment of the term loan up to the first  of obligations thereunder 
at closing  monitronics borrowed the full amount of the term loan and  under the revolving credit facility  for total initial borrowings under the credit facility of  the proceeds of such loans  after repayment of  outstanding under a previously existing credit facility  and payment of certain fees and expenses relating to the credit facility  were used to fund a portion of the aggregate merger consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of monitronics 
the remaining cash consideration paid was funded by cash on hand 
monitronics is primarily engaged in the business of providing security alarm monitoring services monitoring signals from burglaries  fires  medical alerts  and other events  as well as providing customer service and technical support 
nearly all of its revenues are derived from monthly recurring revenues under security alarm monitoring contracts purchased from independent dealers in its exclusive nationwide network 
revenues are recognized as the related monitoring services are provided 
other revenues are derived primarily from the provision of third party contract monitoring services and from field technical repair services 
all direct external costs associated with the creation of subscriber accounts are capitalized and amortized over fifteen years using a declining balance method beginning in the month following the date of purchase 
internal costs  including all personnel and related support costs incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions  are expensed as incurred 
account cancellation  otherwise referred to as subscriber attrition  has a direct impact on the number of subscribers that monitronics services and on its financial results  including revenues  operating income and cash flow 
a portion of the subscriber base can be expected to cancel its service every year 
subscribers may choose not to renew or terminate their contract for a variety of reasons  including relocation  cost  switching to a competitors service  and service issues 
the largest category of canceled accounts relate to subscriber relocation or the inability to contact the subscriber 
monitronics defines its attrition rate as the number of canceled accounts in a given period divided by the weighted average of subscribers for that period 
monitronics considers an account canceled when a subscriber terminates in accordance with the terms of the contract or if payment from the subscriber is deemed uncollectible 
if a subscriber relocates but continues its service  this is not a cancellation 
if the subscriber relocates  discontinues its service and a new subscriber takes over the original subscriber s service continuing the revenue stream a new owner takeover  this is also not a cancellation 
monitronics adjusts the number of canceled accounts by excluding those that are contractually guaranteed by its dealers 
the typical dealer contract provides that if a subscriber cancels in the first year of its contract  the dealer must either replace the canceled account with a new one or refund the purchase price 
to help ensure the dealer s obligation to monitronics  monitronics holds back a portion of the purchase price for every account purchased  typically 
in some cases  the amount of the purchase holdback may be less than actual attrition experience 

table of contents the table below presents subscriber data for the twelve months ended december  and twelve months ended december  beginning balance of accounts content services group accounts purchased accounts cancelled a accounts guaranteed to be refunded by dealer ending balance of accounts monthly weighted average accounts attrition rate a a net of canceled accounts that are contractually guaranteed by the dealer 
monitronics also analyzes its attrition by classifying accounts into annual pools based on the year of purchase 
monitronics then tracks the number of accounts that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of accounts purchased for each pool for each year subsequent to its purchase 
based on the average cancellation rate across the pools  in recent years monitronics has averaged less than attrition within the initial month period after considering the accounts which were replaced or refunded by the dealers at no additional cost to monitronics 
over the next three years of the subscriber account life  the number of subscribers that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of subscribers in that pool gradually increases and historically has peaked between the third and fourth years 
the peak between the third and fourth years is primarily a result of the buildup of subscribers that moved or no longer had need for the service prior to the third year but did not cancel their service until the end of their three year contract 
after the fourth year  the number of subscribers that cancel as a percentage of the initial number of subscribers in that pool declines 
adjusted ebitda beginning in the first quarter of  ascent capital changed one of the key financial measures that it uses to evaluate its performance 
ascent capital now uses net income loss before interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depreciation  amortization including the amortization of subscriber accounts and dealer network  realized and unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments  non cash or non recurring restructuring charges and stock based and other non cash long term incentive compensation which is referred to as adjusted ebitda instead of adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization  and stock based and other non cash long term incentive compensation which is referred to as adjusted oibda 
ascent capital made this change as a result of the sale of most of its historical operating subsidiaries and the acquisition of monitronics  a security alarm monitoring company  which is now its primary operating subsidiary 
financial information for prior periods has been revised to retrospectively reflect ascent capital s change in this financial measure 
ascent capital believes that adjusted ebitda is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its business  including the business ability to fund its ongoing acquisition of subscriber accounts  its capital expenditures and to service its debt 
in addition  this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance 
adjusted ebitda is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in the security alarm monitoring industry and is one of the financial measures  subject to certain adjustments  by which covenants are calculated under the agreements governing monitronics debt obligations 
adjusted ebitda does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles  should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs 
it is  however  a measurement that ascent capital believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance 
accordingly  adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income  cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
as companies often define non gaap financial measures differently  adjusted ebitda as calculated by ascent capital should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies

revenue is generated from alarm monitoring operations within the monitronics business  which was acquired on december  the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to a full year s operations in as compared to days in furthermore  revenue increased as a result of a increase in monthly weighted average subscriber accounts from  for the twelve months ended december  to  for the twelve months ended december  as ascent capital did not own monitronics in  there was no revenue for the respective period as businesses existing in have been included in discontinued operations 
cost of services 
cost of services increased  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
cost of services includes costs incurred from alarm monitoring operations within the monitronics business  which was acquired on december  the increase in cost of services is attributable to a full year s operations in as compared to days in as ascent capital did not own monitronics in  there was no cost of services for the respective period as businesses existing in have been included in discontinued operations

the expense for the year ended december   was related to restricted stock and stock option awards granted to certain executives 
amortization of subscriber accounts and dealer network 
amortization expense was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for  the increase in amortization expense of  is primarily due to a full year s amortization occurring in as compared to days in the company had no such assets in  thus no amortization was recorded for that year 
restructuring charges 
during  and  we completed certain restructuring activities and recorded charges of   and  respectively  which relate to our continuing operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we began a new restructuring plan the restructuring plan in conjunction with the expected sales of the creative media and content distribution businesses 
the restructuring plan was implemented to meet the changing strategic needs of the company as we sold most of our media and entertainment services assets and acquired monitronics  an alarm monitoring business 
such charges included retention costs for employees to remain employed until the sales are complete  severance costs for certain employees that were not retained by the buyers and facility costs that were no longer being used by us due to the sales 
before we implemented the restructuring plan  we had just completed a restructuring plan that was implemented in and concluded in september the restructuring plan 
the restructuring plan was implemented to align our organization with our strategic goals and how we operate  manage and market our services 
the restructuring plan charges included severance costs from labor cost mitigation measures undertaken across all of the businesses and facility costs in conjunction with the consolidation of certain facilities in the united kingdom and the closing of our mexico operations

depreciation expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
depreciation expense increased  and decreased  for the years ended december  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
the increase in is mainly due to depreciation expense related to monitronic s assets which were acquired on december  the decrease in depreciation expense is due to decreased corporate assets as compared to the prior year  partially offset by deprecation of property and equipment acquired in the monitronics acquisition 
interest expense 
interest expense was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense of  and  as compared to the respective prior year is due to the increase in debt associated with the acquisition of monitronics on december  interest expense includes amortization of debt discount of  and  for the years ended december  and realized and unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments 
realized and unrealized loss on derivative financial instruments was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively

discontinued operations the following businesses have been treated as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
systems integration as discussed above  the company shut down the operations of the systems integration business in june in connection with ceasing its operations  the company recorded exit costs of  related to employee severance

the gain and related income tax expense are included in income loss from discontinued operations in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources at december   we have  of cash and cash equivalents   of current restricted cash  and  of marketable securities 
we may use a portion of these assets to decrease debt obligations  fund stock repurchases  or fund potential strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities 
additionally  our other source of funds is our cash flows from operating activities 
in  the operating cash flows were primarily generated from the operations of monitronics  which was acquired in december in and in prior years  the operating cash flows were primarily generated from the creative media  content distribution and systems integration businesses 
since we have sold both the creative media and content distribution business and shutdown the operations of the systems integration business  future operating cash flows will be generated almost entirely from the operations of monitronics 
during the years ended december   and  our cash flow from operating activities was   and  respectively 
the primary driver of our cash flow from operating activities is adjusted ebitda 
fluctuations in our adjusted ebitda are discussed in results of operations above 
in addition  our cash flow from operating activities may be significantly impacted by changes in working capital 
during the years ended december  and  we used cash of  and  respectively  to fund purchases of subscriber accounts 
in addition  during the years ended december   and  we used cash of   and  respectively  to fund our capital expenditures 
in december  we paid cash of  to acquire monitronics  net of monitronics cash on hand of  to fund a portion of the purchase price on monitronics 
on june   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of our series a common stock 
during  we repurchased  shares of our series a common stock at an average purchase price of per share for a total of approximately  pursuant to this authorization 
these shares were returned to authorized and unissued  reducing the number of our shares outstanding 
during  we purchased marketable securities primarily consisting of diversified corporate bond funds for cash of  in order to improve our investment rate of return 
during  we purchased marketable securities consisting of diversified corporate bond funds for cash of  and sold all of the marketable securities we held in december for cash proceeds of  to fund the acquisition of monitronics 
during  we purchased marketable securities consisting of diversified corporate bond funds for cash of  in order to improve our investment rate of return 
we sold a portion of these securities for cash proceeds of  as part of the monitronics acquisition  we assumed monitronics long term debt with a principal balance of million at december  such indebtedness is the obligation of monitronics and certain of its subsidiaries and is not guaranteed by us or any of our other subsidiaries 
in addition to the monitronics cash on hand  we also acquired restricted cash which totaled million at december  also  in order to partially fund the cash consideration used for the monitronics acquisition  monitronics entered into a credit agreement with the lenders party thereto and bank of america  na  as administrative agent the credit facility 
the credit facility provides a  term loan and an  revolving credit facility  under which monitronics has borrowed  as of december  the term loan matures on june   and requires principal installments of  on the first day of business on or after december  and march  the revolving credit facility matures on december  the credit facility is currently subject to certain financial and nonfinancial 
table of contents covenants which include maximum leverage ratios and minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  and beginning june  will become subject to a recurring monthly revenue leverage ratio 
ascent capital guaranteed  of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan outstanding under the credit facility 
in considering our liquidity requirements for  we evaluated our known future commitments and obligations 
we will require the availability of funds to finance the strategy of monitronics  our primary operating subsidiary  which is to grow through subscriber account purchases 
in addition  additional cash will be needed to meet monitronics debt service obligations on its long term debt  any settlement of monitronics derivative financial instruments in advance of their scheduled terms  and capital expenditures 
we also considered the expected cash flow from monitronics  as this business will be the primary driver of our operating cash flows 
in addition  we considered the borrowing capacity of monitronics credit facility  under which monitronics could borrow approximately  as of december  based on this analysis  we expect that cash on hand  cash flow generated from operations and borrowings under the monitronics credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity  given our anticipated current and future requirements 
the existing long term debt of monitronics at december  includes the principal balance of million under a securitization facility 
the class a term notes issued under the securitization facility in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of  are due in full on july   all other notes issued under the facility  including the variable funding notes described below  are due on july  however  certain terms of such securitization facility may impact our liquidity and capital structure in as of december   alarm monitoring agreements for approximately  of monitronics subscriber accounts are owned by monitronics funding lp  a subsidiary of monitronics  which we refer to as funding 
such alarm monitoring agreements  and the monthly recurring revenue and other proceeds thereof  are pledged as collateral to secure the obligations of monitronics under the securitization facility 
under the terms of such facility  issuer currently pays monitronics security lp another subsidiary of monitronics  which we refer to as security for monitoring and servicing the subscriber accounts owned by funding  at an effective rate of per active subscriber account plus reimbursement for field service costs related to customer moves and certain cellular monitoring cost 
fees paid from funding to security can be distributed to monitronics  but cash balances at funding must be used to service the securitization indebtedness 
as the servicing fees paid by funding to security currently exceed the aggregate out of pocket costs of monitoring and servicing such subscriber accounts  the amount of such excess is available to monitronics for other corporate purposes  including the purchase of additional subscriber accounts 
however  under the terms of the securitization facility  effective july  the amount of the servicing fees payable by funding to security will decrease from an effective rate of per active subscriber account to per active subscriber account and the reimbursement for field service costs related to customer moves and certain cellular monitoring cost will be eliminated 
this decrease will substantially reduce or eliminate the excess cash available to security for distribution to monitronics 
accordingly  if monitronics does not repay or refinance the securitization facility by july  the decrease in fees could have a substantially adverse effect on our liquidity and reduce the capital resources available to monitronics for purchasing alarm monitoring accounts 
monitronics is currently exploring opportunities to refinance or amend the terms of its securitization facility to avoid such potential adverse effects on its liquidity and capital resources 
while we expect monitronics will be able to refinance or amend the terms of the securitization facility before july  there can be no assurances that such a refinancing or amendment will be available to monitronics on terms acceptable to us  or on any terms 
in addition  if monitronics does not repay or refinance the securitization facility by july  contingent additional interest will begin to accrue at the rate of per annum including of fees on the two variable funding notes or vfns under the securitization facility  which have an aggregate principal balance of  the effective interest rate payable by monitroinics under million notional amount of swaps relating to the term notes under the securitization facility would also increase by per annum including of fees beginning july  if such swaps are then outstanding 
although such additional interest will not be payable in cash until all of the securitization debt has been paid off  the accrued amount would reduce the borrowing base available to monitronics under its new credit facility and may indirectly reduce monitronics ability to acquire new subscriber accounts 
we may seek external equity or debt financing in the event of any new investment opportunities  additional capital expenditures or our operations requiring additional funds  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that would be acceptable to us or at all 
our ability to seek additional sources of funding depends on our future financial position and results of operations  which are subject to general conditions in or affecting our industry and our customers and to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control 

table of contents contractual obligations information concerning the amount and timing of required payments under our contractual obligations at december  is summarized below payments due by period less than year years years after years total amounts in thousands operating leases long term debt a other total contractual obligations a amounts reflect principal amounts owed and therefore excludes discount of  amounts also exclude interest payments which are based on variable interest rates 
we have contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings and other matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
although it is reasonably possible we may incur losses upon conclusion of such matters  an estimate of any loss or range of loss cannot be made 
in the opinion of management  it is expected that amounts  if any  which may be required to satisfy such contingencies will not be material in relation to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of subscriber accounts 
subscriber accounts  which totaled  at december   relate to the cost of acquiring portfolios of monitoring service contracts from independent dealers 
the subscriber accounts acquired in the monitronics acquisition were recorded at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting 
subscriber accounts purchased subsequent to the acquisition are recorded at cost 
all direct external costs associated with the creation of subscriber accounts are capitalized 
internal costs  including all personnel and related support costs  incurred solely in connection with subscriber account acquisitions and transitions are expensed as incurred 
the costs of subscriber accounts acquired in the monitronics acquisition are amortized using the year declining balance method 
the costs of subscriber accounts acquired subsequent to the acquisition are amortized using the year declining balance method  beginning in the month following the date of purchase 
the amortization methods were selected to provide an approximate matching of the amortization of the subscriber accounts intangible asset to estimated future subscriber revenues based on the projected lives of individual subscriber contracts 
the realizable value and remaining useful lives of these assets could be impacted by changes in subscriber attrition rates  which could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
we review the subscriber accounts for impairment or a change in amortization period whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable or the life should be shortened 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  we view subscriber accounts as a single pool because of the assets homogeneous characteristics  and because the pool of subscriber accounts is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of the other assets and liabilities 
this treatment results from the due diligence program that we have implemented in which a contract must meet certain purchase criteria before we purchase the account 
all of our customers contract for essentially the same service and we are consistent in providing that service regardless of the customers locations 
if we determine that an impairment has occurred  we write the subscriber accounts down to their fair value 
valuation of long lived assets and amortizable other intangible assets 
we perform impairment tests for our long lived assets if an event or circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable 
in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may also strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses 
such activities could result in impairment of our long lived assets or other intangible assets 
we are subject to the possibility of impairment of long lived assets arising in the ordinary course of business 
we regularly consider the likelihood of impairment and may 
table of contents recognize impairment if the carrying amount of a long lived asset or intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic of the fasb asc 
impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we use both the income approach and market approach to estimate fair value 
our estimates of fair value are subject to a high degree of judgment since they include a long term forecast of future operations 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
valuation of trade receivables 
we must make estimates of the collectability of our trade receivables 
we perform extensive credit evaluations on the portfolios of subscriber accounts prior to purchase and require no collateral on the accounts that are acquired 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of subscribers to make required payments 
factors such as historical loss experience  recoveries and economic conditions are considered in determining the sufficiency of the allowance to cover potential losses 
our trade receivables balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  as of december   our trade receivables balance was  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of valuation of deferred tax assets 
in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb asc  we review the nature of each component of our deferred income taxes for the ability to realize the future tax benefits 
as part of this review  we rely on the objective evidence of our current performance and the subjective evidence of estimates of our forecast of future operations 
our estimates of realizability are subject to a high degree of judgment since they include such forecasts of future operations 
after consideration of all available positive and negative evidence and estimates  we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the tax benefits associated with our united states deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax assets  and as such  we have a valuation allowance which totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill 
as of december   we had goodwill of  which represents approximately of total assets 
this goodwill was recorded in connection with the acquisition of monitronics on december  we are required to test goodwill annually for impairment and record an impairment charge if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
recoverability of goodwill for the reporting unit is measured using a discounted cash flow model incorporating discount rates commensurate with the risks involved  which is classified as a level measurement under fasb asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model include discount rates  growth rates  cash flow projections and terminal value rates 
discount rates  growth rates and cash flow projections are the most sensitive and susceptible to change as they require significant management judgment 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in the event that we are not able to achieve expected cash flow levels  or other factors indicate that goodwill is impaired  we may need to write off all or part of our goodwill  which would adversely impact our operating results and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we continually monitor our economic exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates and may enter into foreign exchange agreements where and when appropriate 
substantially all of our foreign transactions are denominated in foreign currencies  including the liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries 
although our foreign transactions are not generally subject to significant foreign exchange transaction gains or losses  the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into united states dollars as part of our consolidated financial reporting 
as a result  fluctuations in exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk as of december   we have variable interest rate debt with principal amounts of  as a result  we have exposure to changes in interest rates related to these debt obligations 
monitronics uses derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure related to the movement in interest rates 
as of december   we have a derivative financial instrument liability of approximately  which represented the derivative s fair value at that date 
the derivatives are not designated as hedges and were entered into with the intention of reducing the risk
