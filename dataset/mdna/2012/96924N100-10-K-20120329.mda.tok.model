as of december   we had a staff of which includes licensed engineers and other professionals 
historically  our clients have primarily been public agencies in communities with populations ranging from  to  people 
we believe communities of this size are underserved by large outsourcing companies that tend to focus on securing large federal and state projects  as well as projects for the private sector 
recently  we have begun to provide increased services to public and private utilities that service major metropolitan communities and commercial and industrial firms  particularly in connection with the growth of our energy efficiency and sustainability services 
we seek to establish close working relationships with our clients and expand the breadth and depth of the services we provide to them over time 
while we currently serve communities throughout the country  our business with public agencies is concentrated in california and neighboring states 
we provide services to approximately of the cities and over of the counties in california 
we also serve special districts  school districts  a range of public agencies and private industry 
our business with public and private utilities is concentrated in california and new york 
we were founded in and willdan group  inc  a delaware corporation  was formed in to serve as our holding company 
we consist of a family of wholly owned companies that operate within the following segments for financial reporting purposes engineering services 
our engineering services segment includes the operations of our subsidiaries  willdan engineering and public agency resources pars 
willdan engineering provides civil engineering related and city planning services to our clients 
pars primarily provides staffing to willdan engineering

for fiscal years and  contract revenue for our homeland security services segment represented approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated contract revenue 
in fiscal and  general economic conditions declined due to a number of factors including slower economic activity  a lack of available credit  decreased consumer confidence and reduced corporate profits and capital spending  leading to a slowdown in construction  particularly residential housing construction  in the western united states 
as a result of this slowdown  both our engineering services segment and public finance services segment suffered declines in revenue and operating margin compression 
while economic conditions began to improve in fiscal and  the recovery has been slow  particularly with regard to our traditional engineering services and public finance services 
however  our profitability has increased in fiscal and as a result of increased revenues from our energy efficiency services segment 
components of income and expense contract revenue we provide our services under contracts  purchase orders or retainer letters 
the contracts we enter into with our clients contain three principal types of pricing provisions time and materials  unit based  and fixed price 
revenue on our time and materials and unit based contracts are recognized as the work is performed in accordance with specific terms of the contract 
approximately of our contracts are based on contractual rates per hour plus costs incurred 
some of these contracts include maximum contract prices  but the majority of these contracts are not expected to exceed the maximum 
contract revenue on our fixed price contracts is determined on the percentage of completion method based generally on the ratio of direct costs incurred to date to estimated total direct costs at completion 
many of our fixed price contracts are relatively short in duration  thereby lowering the risks of not properly estimating the percent complete 
adjustments to contract cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
when the revised estimate indicates a loss  such loss is recognized currently in its entirety 
claims revenue is recognized only upon resolution of the claim 
change orders in dispute are evaluated as claims 
costs related to un priced change orders are expensed when incurred and recognition of the related contract revenue is based on an evaluation of the probability of recovery of the costs 
estimated profit is recognized for un priced change orders if realization of the expected price of the change order is probable 
our contracts come up for renewal periodically and at the time of renewal may be subject to renegotiation  which could impact the profitability on that contract 
in addition  during the term of a contract  public agencies may request additional or revised services which may impact the economics of the transaction 
most of our contracts permit our clients  with prior notice  to terminate the contracts at any time without cause 
while we have a large volume of transactions  the renewal  termination or modification of a contract  in particular our contract with consolidated edison of new york  may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operations 
table of contents direct costs of contract revenue direct costs of contract revenue consist primarily of subconsultant services and that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages that have been incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue also include production expenses and other expenses that are incurred in connection with revenue producing projects 
direct costs of contract revenue generally exclude depreciation and amortization  that portion of technical and nontechnical salaries and wages related to marketing efforts  vacations  holidays and other time not spent directly generating revenue under existing contracts 
such costs are included in general and administrative expenses 
additionally  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefit costs for all of our personnel are included in general and administrative expenses since no allocation of these costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue 
no allocation of facilities costs is made to direct costs of contract revenue nor is depreciation and amortization allocated to direct costs 
we expense direct costs of contract revenue when incurred 
as a firm that provides multiple and diverse services  we do not believe gross margin is a consistent or appropriate indicator of our performance and therefore we do not use this measure as construction contractors and other types of consulting firms may 
other companies may classify as direct costs of contract revenue some of the costs that we classify as general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our direct costs of contract revenue may not be comparable to direct costs for other companies  either as a line item expense or as a percentage of contract revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include the costs of the marketing and support staffs  other marketing expenses  management and administrative personnel costs  payroll taxes  bonuses and employee benefits for all of our employees and the portion of salaries and wages not allocated to direct costs of contract revenue for those employees who provide our services 
general and administrative expenses also include facility costs  depreciation and amortization  professional services  legal and accounting fees and administrative operating costs 
within general and administrative expenses  other includes expenses such as professional services  legal and accounting  computer costs  travel and entertainment and marketing costs 
we expense general and administrative costs when incurred 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
to prepare these financial statements in conformity with gaap  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we describe below those accounting policies that require material subjective or complex judgments and that have the most significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis  based upon information currently available and on various assumptions management believes are reasonable as of the date of this report 
contract accounting applying the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenue requires us to estimate the outcome of our long term contracts 
we forecast such outcomes to the best of our knowledge and belief of current and expected conditions and our expected course of action 
differences between our 
table of contents estimates and actual results often occur resulting in changes to reported revenue and earnings 
such changes could have a material effect on our future consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts based upon our review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
our credit risk is minimal with governmental entities 
accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
for further information on the types of contracts under which we perform our services  see business contract structure elsewhere in this report 
goodwill we test goodwill  at least annually  for possible impairment 
accordingly  we complete our annual testing of goodwill as of the last day of the first month of our fourth fiscal quarter each year to determine whether there is impairment 
in addition to our annual test  we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill 
we recognized impairment charges for fiscal year related to our public finance services reporting unit 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal years or we test our goodwill for impairment at the level of our reporting units  which are components of our operating segments 
the only reporting unit that currently has a material amount of goodwill is energy solutions  which comprises our energy efficiency services segment 
the process of testing goodwill for impairment  pursuant to asu  now involves an optional qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
if a quantitative assessment is warranted  we then determine the fair value of the applicable reporting units 
to estimate the fair value of our reporting units  we use both an income approach based on management s estimates of future cash flows and other market data and a market approach based upon multiples of ebitda earned by similar public companies 
for our annual impairment testing in fiscal years  and  we weighted the income approach and the market approach at and  respectively 
the income approach was given a higher weight because it has a more direct correlation to the specific economics of the reporting units than the market approach  which is based on multiples of public companies that  although comparable  may not provide the same mix of services as our reporting units 
once the fair value is determined  we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than the carrying value  we perform an additional assessment to determine the extent of the impairment based on the implied fair value of goodwill compared with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
in the event that the current implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  an impairment charge is recognized 
inherent in such fair value determinations are significant judgments and estimates  including but not limited to assumptions about our future revenue  profitability and cash flows  our operational plans and our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations 
to the extent these assumptions are incorrect or economic conditions that would impact the future operations of our reporting units change  our goodwill may be deemed to be impaired  and an impairment charge could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation 
at our measurement date  the estimated fair value of our energy solutions reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
a reduction in estimated fair value of our willdan energy solutions reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods 

table of contents accounting for claims against the company we accrue an undiscounted liability related to claims against us for which the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we disclose the amount accrued and an estimate of any reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued  if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements not to be misleading 
we do not accrue liabilities related to claims when the likelihood that a loss has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated  or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote 
losses related to recorded claims are included in general and administrative expenses 
determining probability and estimating claim amounts is highly judgmental 
initial accruals and any subsequent changes in our estimates could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  subject to a judgmental assessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions if it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense

new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this accounting guidance is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing  by allowing companies to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
this guidance is for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted 
we elected to adopt this guidance early  effective the first day of our third quarter of we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  this amount includes million invested in the wells fargo money market mutual fund 
although these investments are subject to variable interest rates  we do not believe we are subject to significant market risk for these short term investments 
we do not engage in trading activities and do not participate in foreign currency transactions or utilize derivative financial instruments 
as of december   we had million outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility that bears interest at variable rates
