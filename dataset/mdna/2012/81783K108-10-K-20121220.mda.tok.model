item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements statements in this discussion and analysis about the company s anticipated financial results and growth  as well as those about the development of its products and markets  are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
these include the risks discussed in item a to this annual report  entitled risk factors  and others discussed in this report 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note of its consolidated financial statements in this annual report 
while these significant accounting policies impact the company s financial condition and results of operations  certain of these policies require management to use a significant degree of judgment and or make estimates  consistent with generally accepted accounting principles  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
since these are judgments and estimates  they are sensitive to changes in business and economic realities  and events may cause actual operating results to differ materially from the amounts derived from management s estimates and judgments 
the company believes the following represent the most critical accounting judgments and estimates affecting its reported financial condition and results of operations bad debts the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts based on known factors related to the credit risk of each customer and management s judgment about the customer s business 
ten customers account for approximately of the company s sales 
at september   the allowance for bad debts amounted to  which represented of receivables 
because of the company s long term relationships with the majority of its customers  in most cases  the principal bad debt risk to the company arises from the insolvency of a customer rather than its unwillingness to pay 
in addition  in certain cases the company maintains credit insurance covering up to of the amount outstanding from specific customers 
the company also carries out some of its foreign trade  particularly in the far east  using letters of credit 
the company reviews all accounts receivable balances on a regular basis  concentrating on any balances that are more than days overdue  or where there is an identified credit risk with a specific customer 
a decision is taken on a customer by customer basis as to whether a bad debt reserve is considered necessary based on the specific facts and circumstances of each account 
in general  the company would reserve of the receivable  net of any recoverable value added taxes or insurance coverages  for a customer that becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy  and lesser amounts for less imminent defaults 
the company maintains a small bad debt reserve to cover the remaining balances based on historical default percentages 
if the financial condition of any of the company s customers is worse than estimated or were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  the company s results may be adversely affected and additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory costs include materials and overhead  and are relieved from inventory on a first in  first out basis 
the company s reported financial condition includes a provision for estimated slow moving and obsolete inventory that is based on a comparison of inventory levels with forecasted future demand 
such demand is estimated based on many factors  including management judgments  relating to each customer s business and to economic conditions 
the company reviews in detail all significant inventory items with holdings in excess of estimated normal requirements 
it also considers the likely impact of changing technology 
it makes an estimate of the provision for slow moving and obsolete stock on an item by item basis based on a combination of likely usage based on forecasted customer demand  potential sale or scrap value and possible alternative use 
this provision represents the difference between original cost and market value at the end of the financial period 
in cases where there is no estimated future use for the inventory item and there is no estimated scrap or resale value  a provision is recorded 
where the company estimates that only part of the total holding of an inventory item will not be used  or there is an estimated scrap  resale or alternate use value  then a proportionate provision is recorded 
once an item has been written down  it is not subsequently revalued upwards 
the provision for slow moving and obsolete inventories at september  was  or of the original cost of gross inventory 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if product designs change more quickly than forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required  which may have a material adverse impact on reported results 
warranty costs the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
accordingly  the provision for warranty costs is based upon anticipated in warranty failure rates and estimated costs of repair or replacement 
anticipating product failure rates involves making judgments about the likelihood of defects in materials  design and manufacturing errors  and other factors that are based in part on historical failure rates and trends  but also on management s expertise in engineering and manufacturing 
estimated repair and replacement costs are affected by varying component and labor costs 
should actual product failure rates and repair or replacement costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and the company s results may be materially adversely affected 
in the event that the company discovers a product defect that impacts the safety of its products  then a product recall may be necessary  which could involve the company in substantial unanticipated expense significantly in excess of the reserve 
there were no safety related product recalls during the past three years 
goodwill impairment at september   the company s balance sheet reflected  of goodwill relating to the controls business 
the company carries out an assessment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances change  to determine if its goodwill has been impaired 
the assessment is based on three separate methods of valuing the controls business based on expected free cash flows  the market price of the company s stock and an analysis of precedent transactions 
these valuation methods require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based on evaluation of historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
based on all of these valuation methods  management concluded in that the goodwill had not been impaired 
if  in future periods  the company s results of operations  cash flows or the market price of the company s stock were to decrease significantly  then it may be necessary to record an impairment charge relating to goodwill of up to  pension plan assumptions the company makes a number of assumptions relating to its pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost 
the most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate  the expected long term return on plan assets  and the rate of future compensation increase 
if these assumptions prove to be incorrect then the company may need to record  and may actually incur  additional expense or liabilities relating to the pension plans  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
at september  there was a pension liability on the company s balance sheet of  the company s pension plans are significant relative to the size of the company 
at september   pension plan assets were valued at  plan liabilities were  and the total assets of the company were  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  changes in the funded status of the pension plans plan assets less plan liabilities are recorded in the company s balance sheet and could have a material effect on the company s financial position 
the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plans deteriorated from a deficit of  at september  to a deficit of  at september  the increase in the deficit of  was due to several factors 
the most significant factor was an actuarial loss of  of which  related to the company s uk defined benefit plan and  related to the company s us defined benefit plan 
the actuarial losses were largely the result of a reduction in the discount rate used by the uk pension plan from at september  to at september  and a reduction in the discount rate used by the us pension plan from at september  to at september  the reductions in the discount rate were largely due to the effect of quantitative easing in the us and us by central banks driving down yields on government bonds 
the increase in the pension liability deficit was partially offset by a curtailment gain of  arising from the freezing of the uk defined benefit plan at september  the table below sets out the approximate impact on the funded status of the company s pension plans at september  that the company estimates would arise from the following respective changes in significant plan assumptions plan assumption change in assumption favorable unfavorable impact on funded status in thousands of dollars change in funded status assumptions impacting accumulated benefit obligation discount rate inflation rate mortality rate year income taxes the company s effective tax rate is dependent on many factors  including the impact of enacted tax laws in jurisdictions in which the company operates  the amount of earnings by jurisdiction  varying tax rates in each jurisdiction and the company s ability to utilize foreign tax credits related to foreign taxes paid on foreign earnings that will be remitted to the us the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or income tax returns 
income taxes are recognized during the period in which the underlying transactions are recorded 
deferred taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities as recorded for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws 
if the company determines that a deferred tax asset arising from temporary differences is not likely to be utilized  the company will establish a valuation allowance against that asset to record it at its expected realizable value 
if the company later determines  based on the weight of available evidence  that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized in the future  the allowance may be reversed in whole or in part 
management considers many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of the company s deferred tax assets  including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other factors 
the range of possible estimates relating to the valuation of the company s deferred tax assets is very wide 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments and it is very difficult to predict when  if ever  management may conclude that any portion of the deferred tax assets is realizable 
as of september   there is a partial valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
if future experience is significantly different from that which was projected in making these assessments  there could be significant additional adjustments to the company s deferred tax assets and income tax expense 
the company recognizes uncertain tax positions when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
although the company believes that its tax positions are appropriate  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could result in material changes in the underlying estimates 
a results of operations compared to the following table compares the results  for both the controls and capacitor segments  with the prior year  showing separately the percentage variances due to currency exchange rate changes and volume

the year began with great momentum as the investments we made in began to translate into higher orders 
in the first half of the year we grew sales in the on road sector and the industrial sector began to recover 
in the second half of the year the business environment began to soften as global macroeconomic factors affected sales of our customers products and  as a result  demand for our controls 
the poor fiscal situation in europe in was one major factor that led to volatility for our products in all market sectors 
in addition  shortened lead times and customer start up project technical issues unrelated to the company had an effect on sales in the second half of the year 
looking forward to  we believe the market weakness will continue to restrain sales and to add volatility to our business until the global economic environment stabilizes  allowing our customers to bring their new projects to market 
however  we believe that the investments made in and in the company s engineering and sales infrastructure will improve the potential for the business in this environment 
the company s traditional markets for industrial applications reflected a modest increase in sales of in  compared to the prior year  as the global economy showed signs of strengthening in some areas 
however  certain areas  including airport ground support and aerial work platform applications  were lower in than the prior year by approximately  although this reduction was more than compensated for by increased sales to fork lift truck and mining customers of and respectively 
sales of controls for on road electric vehicle applications increased in  which reflected continued progress in new product introductions and customer gains in this growing market 
in  sales were  an increase of  or  compared to in  approximately of the company s sales were made outside the united states and were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  principally the euro and the british pound  accordingly  those revenues are subject to fluctuation when translated into us dollars 
in  the average us dollar exchange rate was and lower compared to the british pound and the euro  respectively  than in as a result  foreign currency sales denominated in british pounds and euros translated into less us dollars 
the overall impact to was that reported sales decreased by  or  due to currency rate changes 
excluding the currency impact  volumes shipped in the controls business segment in were  or higher than in this increase compared to the prior year reflected higher sales in each of the regions in which the company operates with the far east and europe ahead by and respectively  and north america  higher than last year 
the increase in sales volume in the far east and europe was largely due to continued customer gains in a range of on road and off road ev applications 
in the capacitor business  reported sales to external customers decreased by  or  compared to currency exchange rate changes decreased sales by  or  and capacitor volumes shipped were  or  lower than last year due principally to reduced demand from the railway signaling market 
cost of sales was  compared to  in  an increase of  the gross profit percentage in of was lower than in when it was  the decrease in the gross profit percentage was principally due to an increase of  in in the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory in the controls segment  which reduced the gross profit percentage by foreign currency fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on gross profit of  this was due to the us dollar being marginally stronger in than in compared with the british pound and the euro  which had an unfavorable impact on sales of  but a favorable impact on cost of sales of  in the controls segment  gross profit of  or  was  or higher than last year  which was due to the increase in volumes shipped in compared to last year 
in the capacitor segment gross profit of  was significantly lower than the gross profit of  the gross profit percentage was of sales in compared to of sales in the decrease in the capacitor business gross profit percentage was mainly due to a lower volume of sales to better margin sectors in compared to and also the impact of largely fixed overhead costs in cost of sales as a percentage of a lower sales total in the table below analyzes the year to year change in sales  cost of sales and gross profit 
in thousands of dollars sales cost of sales gross profit actual change in due to foreign currency fluctuations increased volume  assuming gross profit percentage all other cost of sales changes  net actual selling  research and administrative expenses  excluding a pension curtailment gain of  in and a one time gain of  on the sale of fixed assets in  increased by  or  compared to favorable foreign currency fluctuations decreased reported operating expenses by  or  due to the stronger us dollar in compared to both the british pound and the euro in the prior year 
the increase in selling  research and administrative expenses was largely due to higher employment costs compared to the same period last year  arising from the hiring of additional sales and engineering staff to support the current and future growth of the business 
the company recorded uk government grants of  in associated with research and development expense of  in the same period 
in  the company recorded government grants of  associated with research and development expense of  the grants were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in each period 
in  the company made the decision to freeze the defined benefit pension plan for uk employees effective september  as a result of the amendment  and in accordance with fasb guidance  the company recognized a non cash pre tax pension curtailment gain of  which was credited to operating income in the fourth quarter of this curtailment gain represented the unamortized prior service credit from a plan amendment to change the inflation index for deferred pension plan members from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index 
the credit was previously recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and was being amortized to income over the average life expectancy of participants 
in  the company recorded a one time gain of  from the sale of fixed assets which included a gain of  on the sale of a surplus uk facility offset by a  write down of other fixed assets in the business 
an analysis of the year to year change in selling  research and administrative expenses  before gain on sale of fixed assets and pension curtailment gain  is set out below selling  research and administrative expenses  before gain on sale of fixed assets and pension curtailment gain in thousands of dollars reported expense in reported expense in increase in expense increase due to effect of exchange rate changes higher research and sales and marketing expense  net of currency effect higher administrative expense  net of currency effect total increase in selling  research and administrative expenses  before gain on sale of fixed assets in and pension curtailment gain in there was operating income for the year of  compared to  in  an improvement of  this was due to several factors  including the increase in sales volumes shipped and the pension curtailment gain  offset by higher operating expenses 
the controls business reported operating income of  compared to  in there was an operating loss in the capacitor business of  compared with operating income of  in other income and expense was a net other income of  in compared to a net other expense of  in the previous year 
the change year on year was largely due to a foreign currency exchange gain of  in  compared to a foreign currency loss of  in interest expense was  which was  higher than the prior year  due to higher average borrowings during interest income was  higher at  compared to  in  due to higher average cash balances when in surplus during compared with income before income taxes in was  compared to income before income taxes of  in  an improvement year on year of  foreign currency fluctuations increased pre tax income by  in  the pre tax result  before the effect of the favorable currency fluctuations  was  higher than the prior year 
the company recorded a provision for income tax of  or of the pre tax income for the year compared to an income tax provision of  in the income tax provision of of pre tax income was lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of for several reasons 
there was a benefit of  due to u 
k and french tax rates being lower than the federal tax rate 
the company also recorded  of additional research and development tax credits arising from the research activity in the company s uk operations 
the reduction in the effective tax rate associated with these items was partly offset by an increased tax charge of  arising from a reduction in the uk tax rate in which resulted in a write down in the value of the company s uk deferred tax assets 
the company recorded net income after taxes of  compared to net income after taxes of  last year  an increase of  basic and diluted income per share was 
and  respectively  in compared to basic and diluted income per share of 
and  respectively  in b liquidity and capital resources the company s operating activities generated  of cash during compared with cash used by operating activities for of  acquisitions of property  plant and equipment amounted to  compared to  in exchange rate changes increased cash by  in compared to a decrease of  last year 
at september  the company s cash balances were  compared to  last year 
the main changes in operating assets and liabilities in were a decrease in inventories of  which increased cash during the year  offset by reduced accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively  and taxes paid of  which reduced cash during the year 
the company had a uk bank loan of  of which  was short term and  long term debt at september  the company also has overdraft facilities in the united kingdom amounting to  which were unused as of september  and september  the overdraft facility of the uk capacitor subsidiary is secured by a legal charge over the facility owned and occupied by that company 
the overdraft facility of the uk controls subsidiary is secured by a lien on a facility owned by that company 
both facilities were renewed in the third quarter of for a further period of twelve months but  in line with normal practice in europe  can be withdrawn on demand by the bank 
management believes that  if these facilities were withdrawn  adequate alternative credit resources would be available 
however  this would depend on the company s situation and the economic environment at the time 
accordingly  management does not rely on their availability in projecting the adequacy of the company s capital resources 
in june  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sevcon usa  inc  entered into a  secured revolving credit facility with rbs citizens  national association for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the company and are secured by all of the assets of sevcon usa  inc and a pledge of all of the capital stock of sevcon usa  inc the facility imposes customary limitations on sevcon usa  inc s ability to  among other things  pay dividends  make distributions  and incur additional indebtedness 
under the facility  sevcon usa  inc must maintain  on a quarterly basis  a debt to tangible net worth ratio of no more than and a debt service coverage ratio of no less than for each rolling twelve month period 
at september   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
upon entering into the revolving credit facility  sevcon usa  inc drew down  which was the total amount outstanding at september  and september  the revolving credit facility will expire on june  when all outstanding principal and unpaid interest will be due and payable in full 
there were no significant capital expenditure commitments at september  the company s capital expenditures are expected  on average over a two to three year period  to be less than the depreciation charge  which averaged  over the last three years 
it is estimated that the company will make contributions to its uk and uk defined benefit pension plans of approximately  in should the company suffer a material reduction in revenues in this commitment could adversely impact the company s financial position 
furthermore  a material reduction in revenues in would significantly reduce the company s cash balances  however  in the opinion of management  the company s requirements for working capital to meet projected operational and capital spending needs in both the short term next twelve months and long term twelve to thirty six months can be met by a combination of existing cash resources  future earnings and existing borrowing facilities 
however  the outlook remains uncertain  given the slow recovery in certain geographic markets from the worldwide economic deterioration and fiscal austerity measures in place in some of the company s geographic territories 
any material reduction in revenues will have a materially adverse impact on the company s financial position  which would be exacerbated if any of the company s lenders withdraws or reduces available credit 
if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and if the bank overdraft facilities are withdrawn  the company would need to raise additional debt or equity capital from other sources to avoid significantly curtailing its business and materially adversely affecting its results 
c off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet financing or arrangements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s operations are sensitive to a number of market factors  any one of which could materially adversely affect its results of operations in any given year 
foreign currency risk the company sells to customers throughout the industrialized world 
in approximately of the company s sales were made in us dollars  were made in british pounds and were made in euros 
in the controller business the majority of the product is produced in three separate plants in poland  mexico and china and cost of sales is incurred in a combination of british pounds  euros and us dollars 
this resulted in the company s sales and margins being exposed to fluctuations due to the change in the exchange rates of the us dollar  the british pound and the euro 
in addition  the translation of the sales and income of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars is subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company had no foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of september  the following table provides information about the company s foreign currency accounts receivable  accounts payable and firmly committed sales contracts as of september  the information is provided in us dollar amounts  as presented in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in thousands of dollars expected maturity or transaction date fiscal fair value on balance sheet financial instruments in us functional currency accounts receivable in british pounds accounts receivable in euros accounts payable in british pounds accounts payable in euros anticipated transactions in us functional currency firmly committed sales contracts in british pounds in euros interest rate risk the company currently has  of interest bearing debt related to a uk bank loan for the purchase of capital equipment by the company s uk metalized film capacitor business 
in addition  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sevcon usa  inc  has  of interest bearing debt related to a secured revolving credit facility which was entered into for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the company invests surplus funds in instruments with maturities of less than months at both fixed and floating interest rates 
the company incurs short term borrowings from time to time on its overdraft facilities in europe at variable interest rates 
due to the short term nature of the company s investments at september  the risk arising from changes in interest rates was not material
