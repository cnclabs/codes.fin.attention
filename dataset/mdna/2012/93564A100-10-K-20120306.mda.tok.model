item a risk factors you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report or in any other of our filings with the securities and exchange commission could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
in evaluating us  you should consider carefully  among other things  the factors and the specific risks set forth below and in documents we incorporate by reference 
this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
some of the following risks relate principally to the industry in which we operate and to our business 
other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common shares 
if any of the following risks develop into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected  the trading price of your shares could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to the oil and natural gas industry and our business oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
volatility in oil and natural gas prices can adversely affect our results and the price of our common stock 
this volatility also makes valuation of natural gas and oil producing properties difficult and can disrupt markets 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been  and are likely to continue to be  volatile 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
some of the factors that cause these fluctuations are demand for oil and gas  which is affected by worldwide population growth  economic development and general economic and business conditions  the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  political and economic uncertainty and socio political unrest  
table of contents the price of foreign imports  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  especially the middle east and south america  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain oil price and production controls  the level of domestic and international exploration  drilling and production activity  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  weather conditions and changes in weather patterns  the price and availability of  and demand for  competing energy sources  including liquefied natural gas  and alternative energy source  technological advances affecting energy consumption  the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation  including environmental regulations  availability  proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  the price and availability of alternative energy  and variations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices 
additionally  continuance of the current low natural gas price environment  further declines in natural gas prices  lack of natural gas storage may have the following effects on our business reduction of our revenues  operating income and cash flows  curtailment or shut in of our natural gas production due to lack of transportation or storage capacity  cause certain properties in our portfolio to become economically unviable  cause significant reductions in our capital investment programs  resulting in a failure to develop our natural gas reserves  limit our financial condition  liquidity  and or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and operations  the long term effects of these and other conditions on the prices of crude oil and natural gas are uncertain 
price volatility makes it difficult to budget and project the return on exploration and development projects involving our natural gas and oil properties and to estimate with precision the value of producing properties that we may own or propose to acquire 
in addition  unusually volatile prices often disrupt the market for natural gas and oil properties  as buyers and sellers have more difficulty agreeing on the purchase price of properties 
our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas 
our annual and quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of  among other things  variations in natural gas and oil prices and production performance 
in recent years  natural gas and oil price volatility has become increasingly severe 
a decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations  financial commitments  financial results  cash flows  access to capital and ability to grow 
our revenues  operating results  cash flow  profitability and future rate of growth depend upon the prevailing prices of  and demand for  natural gas and oil 
all of our operating revenues are derived 
table of contents from the sale of our oil and gas production 
a continuing substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  our ability to meet capital expenditure obligations and commitments  our results of operations  our access to capital and the quantities of natural gas and oil that may be economically produced by us 
a significant decrease in price levels for an extended period negatively affects us in several ways including our cash flow will be reduced  decreasing funds available for capital investments employed to replace reserves  increase production or to operate  certain reserves will no longer be economic to produce  leading to both lower proved reserves and cash flow and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the value of these assets  and access to other sources of capital  such as bank loans  equity or debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable 
based on crude and natural gas pricing in recent years  the company s oil and gas revenues may from time to time decrease  resulting in a negative impact on liquidity 
the company s current plans to address lower crude and natural gas prices are primarily to reduce capital expenditures to a level equal to cash flow from operations  reduce operating expenses and seek additional capital financing 
however  the company s plans may not be successful in improving its results of operations and liquidity 
if oil or natural gas prices decline significantly for extended periods of time in the future  we might not be able to generate enough cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and make planned capital expenditures  which could impair our liquidity and our ability to develop our properties and to operate 
we may not be able to drill wells on a substantial portion of our acreage 
we may not be able to drill on a substantial portion of our acreage for various reasons 
we may not generate or be able to raise sufficient capital to do so 
future deterioration in commodities pricing may also make drilling some acreage uneconomic 
our actual drilling activities and future drilling budget will depend on drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  lease expirations  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints  regulatory approvals and other factors 
in addition  any drilling activities we are able to conduct may not be successful or add additional proved reserves to our overall proved reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our future business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
our exploration  development  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
under these laws and regulations  we could be held liable for personal injuries  property damage including site clean up and restoration costs  and other damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations  or subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties  including the assessment of natural resources damages 
environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan  permit  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells 
moreover  public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years  and environmental organizations have opposed  with some success  certain drilling projects 
compliance costs are significant 
the exploration and production of oil and gas involves many risks concerning equipment and human operational problems that could lead to leaks or spills of petroleum products 
these laws and regulations  particularly in the california and rocky mountain regions  are extensive and involve severe penalties and could change in ways that substantially increase our costs and associated liabilities 

table of contents as a result  there can be no assurance that our anticipated production levels will be realized or that our estimates of proved reserves will not be negatively impacted 
for example  during the first half of  wtu oil production decreased primarily due to the inability to drill new water injection wells pending the receipt of permits from the california division of oil  gas and geothermal resources doggr 
the doggr has continued to be slow to approve certain new injection permits and as a result we are unable to determine the pace we can develop the wtu until such permits are issued 
part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes  in some cases  federal and state requirements for performing or preparing environmental assessments  environmental impact statements  studies  reports and or plans of development before commencing exploration and production activities 
these regulations affect our operations and may hinder or limit the quantity of oil and natural gas we may be able to produce and sell 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from applicable federal  state and local authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits for producing and water injection wells  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well  or the receipt of a permit with excessive conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to explore or develop our properties 
additionally  the oil and natural gas regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations and  consequently  adversely affect our profitability 
furthermore  we may be put at a competitive disadvantage to larger companies in our industry that can spread these additional costs over a greater number of wells and larger operating area 
any or all of these contingencies could delay or halt our drilling activities or the construction of ancillary facilities necessary for production  which would prevent us from developing our property interests as planned 
conditions  delays or restrictions imposed on the management of groundwater produced during drilling could severely limit our operations or make them uneconomic 
any unfavorable developments in the wilmington townlot unit could impede our growth  as we intend to undertake significant activity in order to increase our production and reserves in this area 
we cannot be certain that existing laws or regulations  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws or regulations will not harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for example  matters subject to regulation and the types of permits required include drilling permits  water discharge and disposal permits for drilling operations  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  drilling and operating bonds  environmental matters and reclamation  spacing of wells  the permitting and use of underground injection wells  which affects the disposal of water from our wells  occupational safety and health  unitization and pooling of properties  air quality  noise levels and related permits  rights of way and easements  reports concerning operations to regulatory authorities  calculation and payment of royalties  
table of contents gathering  transportation and marketing of gas and oil  taxation  and waste disposal 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge or disposal of hazardous materials  well reclamation costs  surface remediation and clean up costs  fines and penalties  natural resource damages  and other environmental protection and damages issues 
see items and business and properties regulations and environmental matters and item legal proceedings for a more detailed discussion of laws affecting our operations 
changes in applicable laws and regulations could increase our costs  reduce demand for our production  impede our ability to conduct operations or have other adverse effects on our business 
future changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject may make it more difficult or expensive to conduct our operations and may have other adverse effects on us 
for example  the epa has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to human health and the environment  which allows the epa to begin regulating emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
the epa has recently begun to implement ghg related reporting and permitting rules 
similarly  the us congress is considering cap and trade legislation that would establish an economy wide cap on emissions of ghgs in the united states and would require most sources of ghg emissions to obtain ghg emission allowances corresponding to their annual emissions of ghgs 
on september   california s governor signed into law assembly bill ab  known as the california global warming solutions act of  which establishes a statewide cap on ghgs that will reduce the state s ghg emissions to levels by and establishes a cap and trade program 
the california air resources board has been designated as the lead agency to establish and adopt regulations to implement ab by january  similar regulations may be adopted by the federal government 
any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce emissions of ghgs would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  or the reform act  among other things  imposes restrictions on the use and trading of certain derivatives  including energy derivatives 
the nature and scope of those restrictions will be determined in significant part through implementing regulations to be adopted by the sec  the commodities futures trading commission and other regulators 
if  as a result of the reform act or its implementing regulations  additional capital or margin requirements or other limitations relating to our commodity derivative activities are imposed  this could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our hedging strategy 
in particular  a requirement to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions  which are 
table of contents currently collateralized on a non cash basis by our oil and natural gas properties and other assets  would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy or to meet the hedging requirements contained in our revolving credit facility 
in addition  requirements and limitations imposed on our derivative counterparties could increase the costs of pursuing our hedging strategy 
in addition  some of our activities involve the use of hydraulic fracturing  which is a process that creates a fracture extending from the well bore in a rock formation to enable oil or natural gas to move more easily through the rock pores to a production well 
fractures are typically created through the injection of water and chemicals into the rock formation 
legislative and regulatory efforts at the federal level and in some states have been made to render permitting and compliance requirements more stringent for hydraulic fracturing 
these proposals  if adopted  would likely increase our costs and make it more difficult  or impossible  to pursue some of our development projects 
we could also be adversely affected by future changes to applicable tax laws and regulations 
for example  proposals have been made to amend federal and or california state and local laws to impose windfall profits  severance or other taxes on oil and natural gas companies 
if any of these proposals become law  our costs would increase  possibly materially 
significant financial difficulties currently facing the state of california and localities may increase the likelihood that one or more of these proposals will become law 
for example  in california  there have been proposals at the legislative and executive levels over the past two years for tax increases which have included a severance tax as high as on all oil production in california 
although the proposals have not passed the california legislature  the financial crisis in the state of california could lead to a severance tax on oil being imposed in the future president obama has made proposals that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to united states tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could defer or eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have incurred losses and may do so in the future 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and total stockholders equity of million 
we have recognized a significant amount of annual net losses in the past 
see item selected consolidated financial data 
the uncertainty and factors described throughout this section may impede our ability to economically find  develop  exploit and acquire natural gas and oil reserves 
we may not achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 
our proved reserves are estimates based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil and natural gas in an exact way 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control that could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated 
oil and natural gas reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  production levels  operating and development costs  drilling expenses  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures  ownership and title matters  taxes and the availability of funds 
the engineering process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex and is not an exact science 
it requires interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 

table of contents estimates of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of expected timing and future net cash flows prepared or audited by different engineers  or by the same engineers at different times  may vary substantially 
because of the subjective nature of crude oil and natural gas reserve estimates  each of the following items may differ materially from the amounts or other factors estimated the amount and timing of crude oil and natural gas production 
the revenues and costs associated with that production 
the amount and timing of future development expenditures 
over time  our independent petroleum engineering consultants may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling  testing  and production 
further  the potential for future reserve revisions  either upward or downward  is significantly greater than normal because a significant portion of our potential reserves are undeveloped 
in accordance with sec requirements  our estimates of proved reserves for are determined based on a historical month average price as of the first day of each month during the fiscal year 
any significant variance from these prices and costs could greatly affect our estimates of reserves 
in addition  proved undeveloped reserves locations to limited to those scheduled to be drilled within the next five years as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our estimated net proved reserves were undeveloped 
undeveloped reserves  by their nature  are less certain 
recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
additionally  as oil and gas commodity prices become lower  the quantity of economically recoverable proved reserves declines 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital expenditures to develop our reserves 
we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards 
however  the estimated costs may not be accurate  development may not occur as scheduled  or the actual results may not be as estimated 
we may not have  or be able to obtain  the capital we need to develop these proved reserves 
actual natural gas and oil prices  future production  revenues  operating expenses  taxes  development expenditures and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of future net revenues set forth in this annual report 
a reduction in natural gas and oil prices  for example  would reduce the value of proved reserves and reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that could be economically produced  thereby reducing the quantity of reserves 
we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues referred to in this annual report is the current market value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any change in consumption by natural gas and oil purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation will also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses for the development and production of our natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor  nor does it reflect discount factors used in the marketplace for the purchase and sale of oil and gas properties 
conditions in the oil and 
table of contents gas industry and oil and gas prices will affect whether the discount factor accurately reflects the market value of our estimated reserves 
the geographic concentration and characteristics of our oil reserves may have a greater effect on our ability to sell our oil production 
all of our oil reserves are located in california 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  natural disasters and restrictive regulations that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
our california oil production is  on average  heavier than premium grade light oil and the margin sales price minus production costs is generally less than that of lighter oil sales due to the processes required to refine this type of oil and the transportation requirements 
as such  the effect of material price decreases will more adversely affect the profitability of heavy oil production compared with lighter grades of oil 
certain of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage 
as of december   we own leasehold interests in approximately  net acres in areas in the washakie basin of wyoming that we believe may be prospective for the cbm and approximately  net acres in areas we believe may be prospective for the niobrara shale 
a large portion of our acreage is not currently held by production 
unless production in paying quantities is established on units containing these leases during their terms  approximately  net acres of these leases will expire in if our leases expire  we will lose our right to develop the related properties 
our drilling plans for these areas are subject to change based upon various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints  and regulatory approvals 
further  some of our acreage is located in sections where we do not hold the majority of the acreage and therefore it is likely that we will not be named operator of these sections 
as a non operating leaseholder we have less control over the timing of drilling and there is therefore additional risk of expirations occurring in sections where we are not the operator 
drilling for and producing natural gas and oil are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future success depends largely on the success of our exploration  exploitation  development and production activities 
these activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that we will not find any commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties depends in part on the evaluation of geophysical and geological analyses  production data  and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
our costs of drilling  completing  producing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences 
drilling for oil and natural gas can be unprofitable  not only from dry holes  but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
in addition  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of other factors  including delays in obtaining drilling permits from applicable regulatory authorities  unusual or unexpected geological formations  unexpected drilling conditions  including ground shifting or quakes  
table of contents pressure or irregularities in geological formations  equipment failures or accidents  well blow outs  fires and explosions  pipeline and processing interruptions or unavailability  title problems  objections from surface owners and nearby surface owners in the areas where we operate  adverse weather conditions  lack of market demand for natural gas and oil  delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with environmental and other regulatory requirements  shortages of or delays in the availability or delivery of drilling rigs and the delivery of equipment  and reductions in natural gas and oil prices 
our future drilling activities may not be successful 
our drilling success rate could decline generally or within a particular area and we could incur losses by drilling unproductive wells 
also  we may not be able to obtain sufficient contracts covering our lease rights in potential drilling locations 
we cannot be sure that we will ever drill our identified potential drilling locations  or that we will produce natural gas or oil from them or from any other potential drilling locations 
shut in wells  curtailed production and other production interruptions may negatively impact our business and result in decreased revenues 
all of our oil production is dedicated to one customer and as a result  our credit exposure to this customer is significant 
we have entered into an oil marketing arrangement with conocophillips under which conocophillips purchases all of our net oil production in california 
we generally do not require letters of credit or other collateral to support these trade receivables 
accordingly  a material adverse change in their financial condition could adversely impact our ability to collect the applicable receivables  and thereby affect our financial condition 
our credit facility contains operating restrictions and financial covenants  and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit 
we will depend on our revolving credit facility for a portion of our future capital needs 
as of december   we had million in principal amount of senior indebtedness outstanding under our secured revolving bank credit facility and our available borrowing base was million 
our credit facility restricts our ability to obtain additional financing  make investments  pay dividends  lease equipment  sell assets and engage in business combinations 
we also are  and will continue to be  required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants  including the following financial maintenance covenants an ebitdax to interest coverage ratio for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be not less than to  determined as of the last day of each fiscal quarter  and a minimum current ratio of current assets including availability under the credit facility to current liabilities of not less than to at december   the company was in full compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the credit facility 

table of contents in addition to those described above  other factors may impair the company s ability to comply with the covenants 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of the credit facility could result in a default  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
at certain oil and natural gas price levels  the company s current cost structure  inclusive of our current plans  may exceed the costs required to operate profitably 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control 
our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants contained in the credit facility could result in a default under the facility  which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to become immediately due and payable 
our credit facility limits the funds we can borrow to a borrowing base amount  determined by the lenders in their sole discretion  based upon projected revenues from the oil and natural gas properties securing our loan 
in addition  under the terms of our credit facility  our borrowing base is subject to redeterminations at least semiannually on april and october of each year based in part on prevailing natural gas and oil prices 
the lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of the lenders holding of the commitments 
if the required lenders do not agree on an increase  then the borrowing base will be the lowest borrowing base acceptable to the required number of lenders 
in the event the borrowed amount outstanding exceeds the re determined borrowing base  we could be forced to repay a portion of our borrowings 
if lower oil and natural gas commodity prices occur  our borrowing base may be lowered by the lenders upon a future borrowing base re determination 
we may not have sufficient funds to make any required repayment 
if we do not have sufficient funds and are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings or arrange new financing  in order to prevent a default we may have to sell a portion of our assets 
if we cannot timely sell a portion of our assets under such circumstances  the lenders could declare the credit facility in default  which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
our credit facility is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our producing natural gas and oil properties and assets  is guaranteed by our subsidiaries  and contains covenants that limit additional borrowings  dividends to nonpreferred shareholders  the incurrence of liens  investments  sales or pledges of assets  changes in control  repurchases or redemptions for cash of our common or preferred stock  speculative commodity transactions and other matters 
we may not be able to refinance our debt or obtain additional financing  particularly in view of the credit facility s restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  and the fact that substantially all of our assets are currently pledged to secure obligations under the credit facility 
the restrictions in our credit facility and our difficulty in obtaining additional debt financing may have adverse consequences on our operations and financial results  including our ability to obtain financing for working capital  capital expenditures  our drilling program  purchases of new technology or other purposes may be impaired  the covenants in our credit facility that limit our ability to borrow additional funds and dispose of assets may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions  because our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates  we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates  any additional financing we obtain may be on unfavorable terms  
table of contents we may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments  which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities  a substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements or covenants  and could require us to modify our operations  including curtailing portions of our drilling program  selling assets  reducing our capital expenditures  refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing  and we may become more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy generally 
we may be required to incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance 
general economic conditions  natural gas and oil prices and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  affect our operations and our future performance 
we are subject to the full cost ceiling limitation which may result in a write down of our estimated net reserves in the future 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our natural gas and oil properties 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the cost center ceiling  we are subject to a write down of our net oil and gas properties to the extent of such excess 
a capitalized cost ceiling test impairment also reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower amortization expense in future periods 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
for  and  there was no ceiling test impairment on our oil and gas properties 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  a write down of proved oil and natural gas properties may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments in our estimated proved reserves  or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the applicable ceiling in the subsequent period 
this and other factors could cause us to write down our natural gas and oil properties or other assets in the future and incur a non cash charge against future earnings 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our natural gas and oil reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we spend and will continue to need a substantial amount of capital for the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and gas reserves 
we have historically addressed our short and long term liquidity needs through the use of cash flow provided by operating activities  borrowing under bank credit facilities  and the issuance of equity and debt securities 
without adequate financing we may not be able to successfully execute our operating strategy 
the availability of these sources of capital will depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include general economic and financial market conditions  
table of contents oil and natural gas prices  our market value and operating performance  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  the success of our cbm projects in the washakie basin  the success of our waterflood recovery oil projects in the wilmington townlot unit and the north wilmington unit  our success in locating and producing new reserves  amounts of necessary working capital and expenses  and the level of production from existing and new wells 
we may be unable to execute our operating strategy if we cannot obtain adequate capital 
if low oil and natural gas prices  lack of adequate gathering or transportation facilities  operating difficulties or other factors  many of which are beyond our control  cause our revenues and cash flows from operating activities to decrease  it may limit or reduce our borrowing base under our credit facility  and therefore  limit our ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations 
additional financing sources may be required in the future to fund our developmental and exploratory drilling 
our credit facility restricts our ability to obtain new financing 
there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional financing 
issuing equity securities to satisfy our financing requirements could cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
additional debt financing could lead to a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest  becoming more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns  and restrictions on our operations 
financing may not be available in the future under existing or new financing arrangements  or we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if sufficient capital resources are not available  we may be forced to curtail our drilling  acquisition and other operations  or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis  or face a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves  which would have an adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future success depends on our ability to find  develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
our proved reserves generally decline when production occurs unless we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  or both 
we may not be able to find  develop or acquire additional reserves on an economic basis 
furthermore  if oil and natural gas prices increase  our costs for additional reserves could also increase 
thus  our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find  finance or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs 

table of contents our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage 
these identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  oil and natural gas prices  costs and expenses  and drilling and production results 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled  or if we will be able to produce natural gas or oil from these or any other potential drilling locations 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified  which could adversely affect our business 
we face significantly increasing water injection and disposal regulations and costs in our drilling operations 
in california  as part of our waterflood development plan for the wtu and nwu  over the next years we will require water injection well approvals from the california doggr 
we believe that due to the doggr s personnel constraints and new more rigid review and interpretation procedures  water injection permits have been taking longer than previous permits 
during  warren only received one water injection permit for a wtu tar formation well 
further  due to the volume of water being injected into the upper terminal formation and the corresponding rise in reservoir pressure  during  we have elected to temporarily shut in approximately net bopd approximately  barrels of oil annually from lower producing  higher water cut wells  until additional water injection well permits are obtained for the tar and ranger formations 
additionally  as a result of the delay in receiving water injection permits  the reservoir pressure in the tar formation has dropped  resulting in a steeper production decline 
a new head of doggr was appointed in november  and since then doggr has switched to a more practical  risk based evaluation  resulting in timelier reviews of applications for injection permits 
in january  warren received permits for water injection wells in its wtu upper terminal formation 
we cannot be certain  however  of when doggr will issue the other wtu water injection permits for our other pending applications 
the wyoming department of environmental quality  or wyoming deq  has restrictive regulations applicable to the surface disposal of water produced from our cbm drilling operations 
we typically obtain clean water act  safe drinking water act and analogous state and local permits to use surface discharge methods  such as settling ponds  to dispose of water when the groundwater produced from the coal seams will not exceed surface discharge permit limitations 
surface disposal options have volumetric limitations and require an extensive third party water sampling and laboratory analysis program to ensure compliance with state permit standards 
alternative methods to surface disposal of water are more expensive 
these alternatives include installing and operating treatment facilities or drilling disposal wells to inject the produced water into the underground rock formations adjacent to the coal seams or lower sandstone horizons 
injection wells are regulated by the wyoming deq and the wyoming oil gas conservation commission  and permits to drill these wells are obtained from these agencies 
based on our experience with cbm production  we believe that permits for surface discharge of produced water in the washakie basin will become difficult to obtain 
in wyoming  our produced water is currently re injected into water disposal wells 
we expect the regulation and costs to dispose of produced water to increase significantly  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face increasing natural gas disposal regulations and costs in our wilmington oil operations that could limit our oil production 
the state of california and the epa have restrictive regulations for the disposition of natural gas produced from our wilmington oil drilling operations 
natural gas production has continued to grow with the oil production  particularly at the wtu 
because the gas volume from the wtu was historically too low to justify gas sales equipment  the gas has been flared for many years under a permit from the scaqmd 
in late  warren entered into an agreement with the scaqmd which allowed warren to commission six microturbines to generate electrical power from the otherwise flared gas and resume full production 
as oil production grew since that time  the excess gas produced but not consumed by our microturbines could have exceeded our gas flare limitation 
in march  the company presented its plan to the scaqmd to seek approvals from regulatory authorities to dispose of our wtu produced gas by re injection in underground formations or by selling it directly to a nearby public utility or a third party user 
warren also applied to the scaqmd for a permit to construct a new high efficiency clean enclosed burner to replace the existing gas flare 
our filed applications for permits request the authority to install and operate certain pieces of new best available control technology equipment 
on july  the scaqmd certified the company s ceqa documents and issued all of the related permits  including gas handling equipment 
these equipment upgrades will help increase the company s oil processing capability to a ceiling of  barrels of oil per day at the wilmington townlot unit 
delays by regulatory agencies in approving our permits in the future to dispose of the natural gas could limit our future oil production levels until the permits are issued 
see items and business and properties future regulations wilmington field operational impediments may hinder our access to natural gas and oil markets or delay our production 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
this dependence is heightened in our cbm operations where this infrastructure is less developed than in our traditional oil and gas operations 
for example  there is limited pipeline capacity in the southern portion of the washakie basin 
also  as production volumes grow in the atlantic rim  additional pipeline capacity and gas compression will be required 
we deliver natural gas and oil through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may not be available to us in the future 
our ability to produce and market natural gas and oil is affected and may be harmed by the lack of pipeline transmission facilities or carrying capacity  federal and state regulation of natural gas and oil production  and federal and state transportation  taxation and energy policies 
in  we entered into an agreement with anadarko to jointly construct compression facilities and a pipeline in the washakie basin 
any significant change in our arrangement with anadarko or other market factors affecting our overall infrastructure facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver the natural gas we produce to market in an efficient manner  or to obtain adequate natural gas prices 
in some cases  we may be required to shut in wells  at least temporarily  for lack of a market or because of the inadequacy or unavailability of transportation facilities 
if that were to occur  we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements could be made to deliver our production to market 

table of contents we may be affected by climate change and market or regulatory responses to climate change climate change  including the impact of global warming  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
restrictions  caps  taxes  or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gasses  including exhaust from generators  engines and flaring of excess natural gas  could significantly increase our operating costs 
restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that a use oil and gas to produce energy  or b manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels  including chemical producers  farmers and food producers  and automakers and other manufacturers 
significant cost increases  government regulation  or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy or emissions reductions could materially affect the markets for the oil and gas commodities  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy could also affect certain of our oil and gas commodity purchasers and the markets for certain of the commodities in an unpredictable manner  including  for example  the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers and tax credits for wind turbine and solar power generation 
finally  we could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change 
any of these factors  individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors  or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the demand for oil and gas commodities and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and liquidity 
our hedging activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income 
to achieve a more predictable cash flow  to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas and to comply with credit agreement requirements  we currently  and may in the future  enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production 
hedging arrangements for a portion of our oil and natural gas production expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and the actual price received 
in addition  these types of hedging arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas and may expose us to cash margin requirements 
the risk that a counterparty may default on its obligations is heightened by the recent sub prime mortgage losses incurred by many banks and other financial institutions  including our counterparties or their affiliates 
these losses may affect the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations to us on hedge transactions  which would reduce our revenues from hedges at a time when we are also receiving a lower price for our natural gas and oil sales 
as a result  our financial condition could be materially or adversely affected 
we have elected not to designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  such contracts are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet and changes in fair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as they occur 

table of contents we may incur additional debt in order to fund our exploration and development activities  which would reduce our financial flexibility and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to our credit facility  we may incur additional debt in order to fund our operations  make future acquisitions or develop our properties 
a higher level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our ability to meet our debt obligations and reduce our level of indebtedness depends on future performance 
general economic conditions  oil and gas prices  and financial  business and other factors affect our operations and our future performance 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or pay our debt at maturity 
if we are unable to repay our debt at maturity with existing cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance the debt or repay the debt with the proceeds of a debt or equity offering 
we may be unable to sell public debt or equity securities  or do so on acceptable terms to pay or refinance the debt 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions  our market value and profitability of our operations at the time of the offering or other financing 
if we do not have sufficient funds  are otherwise unable to negotiate renewals of our borrowings  or arrange new financing  we may have to sell significant assets 
any such sale could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
properties that we buy may not produce as projected  and we may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them  which could cause us to incur losses 
one of our growth strategies is to pursue selective acquisitions of natural gas and oil reserves 
we perform a review of the target properties that we believe is consistent with industry practices 
however  these reviews may not be completely accurate 
generally  it is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems  such as groundwater contamination  are not necessarily observable  even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  a seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems  and we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with the properties we acquire 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 
oil and natural gas operations in the rocky mountains can be adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife 
our operations in wyoming are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions and in difficult terrain 
primarily in the winter and spring  our operations are often curtailed because of cold  snow and wet conditions  as well as lease stipulations 
in certain areas on federal lands  drilling and other oil and natural gas activities can only be conducted during limited times of the year 
this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those times for drilling rigs  oil field equipment  services  supplies and qualified personnel  which may lead to periodic shortages 
these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists  engineers  landmen and other professionals 
competition for many of these professionals is intense 
if we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel and professionals  our ability to compete could be harmed 
we do not insure against all potential operating risks 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of various lawsuits  which may not be fully covered by our insurance

table of contents or political issues 
the ultimate impact on us of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown  but our revenue  profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster 
our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are subject to numerous hazards and risks associated with drilling for  operating  producing and transporting natural gas and oil  and any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of natural gas  oil  brine water  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination  abnormally pressured formations and ground subsidence  mechanical difficulties  inadequate oil field drilling and service tools  and casing collapses  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  labor and employment  regulatory investigations and penalties  and natural disasters  such as earthquakes  hurricanes and floods 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us 
many of these risks are not insured as the cost of available insurance  if any  is excessive 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see items and business and properties operating hazards and insurance 
we have limited control over activities on properties we do not operate  which could reduce our production and revenues 
a substantial amount of our business activities are conducted through joint operating or other agreements under which we own partial ownership or working interests in natural gas and oil properties 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we have an interest and in many cases we do not have the ability to remove the operator in the event of poor performance 
as a result  we have a limited ability to exercise influence over normal operating procedures  expenditures or future development of underlying properties and their associated costs 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  or an operator s breach of the applicable agreements  could reduce our revenues and production 
therefore  the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our and the operator s control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  inclusion of other participants in drilling wells  and use of technology 

table of contents defects in the title to any of our natural gas and oil interests could result in the loss of some of our natural gas and oil properties or portions thereof  or liability for losses resulting from defects in the assignment of leasehold rights 
we obtain interests in natural gas and oil properties with varying degrees of warranty of title  such as general  special or quitclaim or without any warranty 
we acquired our interests in the wilmington townlot unit in and with no title opinion as to the interests acquired  which may ultimately prove to be less than the interests we believe we own 
the prior owner had acquired its interests from a third party that  in turn  had acquired its interest from exxon corporation with no warranty of title 
exxon had owned the wilmington townlot unit for over years before its sale in similarly  when we acquired our interest in the north wilmington unit in december  we had no title opinion prepared as to the interests acquired 
the prior owner had owned the north wilmington unit for over years  acquired the north wilmington unit from sun oil corporation without warranty of title  which had owned unit for over years before its sale in losses of title to the wilmington townlot unit or north wilmington units may result from title defects or from ownership of a lesser interest than we believe we acquired 
in other instances  title opinions may not be obtained if in our discretion it would be uneconomical or impractical to do so 
this increases the possible risk of loss and could result in total loss of title to some or all of the properties we purchased 
furthermore  in certain instances we may determine to purchase properties even though certain technical title defects exist if we believe it to be an acceptable risk under the circumstances 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield natural gas or oil in commercially viable quantities 
a prospect is a property on which we have identified what our geoscientists believe  based on available seismic and geological information  to be indications of natural gas or oil 
our prospects are in various stages of evaluation  ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation 
however  the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling and testing whether natural gas or oil will be present or  if present  whether natural gas or oil will be present in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable 
if we drill wells in our current and future prospects that are identified as non economic or dry holes  our drilling success rate may decline and materially harm our business 
in sum  the cost of drilling  completing and operating any wells is often uncertain and new wells may not be productive 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater financial  technological and other resources than we do  which may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we operate in highly competitive areas of oil and natural gas exploration  development and acquisition with a substantial number of other companies 
we face intense competition from independent  technology driven companies  as well as from both major and other independent oil and gas companies  in each of the following areas acquiring desirable producing properties or new leases for future exploration  marketing our natural gas and oil production  integrating new technologies  and acquiring the equipment  personnel and expertise necessary to develop and operate our properties 
many of our competitors have financial  managerial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours 
these companies may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and gas properties  and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of 
table of contents properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
to the extent our competitors are able to pay more for properties than we are  we will be at a competitive disadvantage 
further  many of our competitors may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can 
our ability to explore for natural gas and oil and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties  and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
shortages of rigs  equipment  supplies and personnel could delay or otherwise adversely affect our cost of operations or our ability to operate according to our business plans 
if domestic drilling activity increases  particularly in the fields in which we operate  a general shortage of drilling and completion rigs  field equipment and qualified personnel could develop 
as a result  the costs and delivery times of rigs  equipment and personnel could be substantially greater than in previous years 
from time to time  these costs have sharply increased and could do so again 
the demand for and wage rates of qualified drilling rig crews generally rises in response to the increasing number of active rigs in service and could increase sharply in the event of a shortage 
although warren owns a drilling rig for use in the wtu  shortages of drilling and completion rigs  field equipment or qualified personnel could delay  restrict or curtail our exploration and development operations  which could in turn harm our operating results 
increases in taxes on energy sources may adversely affect the company s operations 
federal  state and local governments which have jurisdiction in areas where the company operates impose taxes on the oil and natural gas products sold 
historically  there has been an on going consideration by federal  state and local officials concerning a variety of energy tax proposals 
as an example  there is a new proposal in california to impose a severance tax on oil produced in california  which requires a majority vote in by the citizens of california 
such matters are beyond the company s ability to accurately predict or control 
computer security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability  which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 
in the ordinary course of our business  warren collects and stores sensitive data  including intellectual property  its proprietary business information  information about its customers  suppliers and business partners  and personally identifiable information about its oil and gas lease lessors royalty holders and its employees in our computer data centers and on our networks 
the secure processing  maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  malfeasance or other disruptions 
any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed  publicly disclosed  lost or stolen 
any such access  disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings  liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information  and regulatory penalties  disrupt our operations  and damage our reputation  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents risks relating to ownership of our common stock the number of shares eligible for future sale or which have registration rights could adversely affect the future market for our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of previously restricted shares of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline  or could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common or preferred stock 
as of december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding   shares of common stock were issuable upon conversion of our convertible debt and convertible preferred stock   shares of common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options  and  shares of restricted stock are issuable upon vesting 
our directors and executive officers  hold approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
if our stockholders sell significant amounts of common stock in any public market that develops or exercise their registration rights and sell a large number of shares  the price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
if we were to include shares held by those holders in a registration statement pursuant to the exercise of their registration rights  those sales could impair our ability to raise needed capital by depressing the price at which we could sell our common stock or impede such an offering altogether 
our stock price has been and may be volatile  and your investment in our stock could decline in value 
in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations

many of these factors are beyond our control  and we cannot predict their potential effects on the price of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 
in addition  the stock markets in general can experience considerable price and volume fluctuations 
control by our executive officers and directors may limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval and could discourage our potential acquisition by third parties 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
these stockholders  if acting together  would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of our board of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock 
provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and maryland law may make it more difficult to effect a change in control  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and maryland law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we may issue shares of preferred stock in the future without stockholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine 
our issuance of this preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding stock and potentially prevent the payment of a premium to stockholders in an acquisition 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change in control of us or our management 
these provisions include giving the board the exclusive right to fill all board vacancies  providing that special meetings of stockholders may only be called by the board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board  either upon a motion or upon written request by holders of at least of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote  or by our president  a classified board of directors  permitting removal of directors only for cause and with a super majority vote of the stockholders  prohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors  and these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
as a result  these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders  and may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 

table of contents we are also subject to provisions of the maryland general corporation law that prohibit business combinations with persons owning or more of the voting shares of a corporation s outstanding stock  unless the combination is approved by the board of directors prior to the person owning or more of the stock  for a period of five years  after which the business combination would be subject to special stockholder approval requirements 
this provision could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company  or may otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control from us  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

failure of the company s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 
the management of warren is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the company s transactions  providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of the financial statements  providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization  and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of the company s financial statements would be prevented or detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit the company s ability to report its financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud

overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore oil and natural gas reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on our waterflood oil recovery programs and horizontal drilling in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california and on the exploration and development of coalbed methane cbm properties located in the rocky mountain region 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  approximately of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contributed drilling locations  paid tangible drilling costs and provided turnkey drilling services 
we also served as operator of these drilling programs and the company retained an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
after our initial public offering in  the company has transitioned from being the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs to becoming a more traditional exploration and production company 
during the second quarter of  the company changed its accounting method for oil and gas properties from the successful efforts method to the full cost method 
as a result of this accounting change  turnkey profit  well services profit and marketing profit are not recognized on the statement of operations but are recorded as reductions to the full cost pool 
all historical information included in this form k has been retroactively restated to give effect to the change in accounting method 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased million during to million at december  this resulted from cash provided by operating activities of million offset by cash used in investing activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
cash provided by operating activities was primarily generated by oil and gas operations 
cash used in investing activities was primarily spent on oil and gas properties and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities primarily represented an increase in net debt under the credit facility 
on december   the company entered into a new  five year million second amended and restated credit agreement with bank of montreal  as administrative agent the agent  and various other lenders named therein  and warren resources of california  inc and warren e p  inc  as guarantors the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility up to 
table of contents the lesser of i million  ii the borrowing base  or iii the draw limit requested by the company 
the credit facility matures on december   is secured by substantially all of warren s oil and gas assets  and is guaranteed by the guarantors  which are two wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
the initial borrowing base was increased to million 
the maximum amount available is subject to semi annual redeterminations of the borrowing base in april and october of each year  based on the value of the company s proved oil and natural gas reserves in accordance with the lenders customary procedures and practices 
both the company and the lenders have the right to request one additional redetermination each year 
the company is subject to various covenants required by the credit facility  including the maintenance of the following financial ratios a minimum current ratio of not less than to including the unused borrowing base and excluding unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments  and a minimum annualized consolidated ebitdax as defined in the credit facility to net interest expense of not less than to depending on the amount outstanding and the level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate loan under the credit facility will be  at the company s option  either a a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the applicable libor period plus the applicable libor margin that ranges from to  or b a base rate loan  or any other obligation other than a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the base rate  calculated to be the higher of i the agent s prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent plus one half percent  plus an applicable base rate margin that ranges from to 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
if oil and gas commodity prices were to decline to lower levels  the company may become in violation of credit facility covenants in the future 
if the company fails to satisfy its credit facility covenants  it would be an event of default 
under such event of default and upon notice  all borrowings would become immediately due and payable to the lending banks 
during  the company incurred million of interest expense under the credit facility of which approximately million was accrued for as of december  the weighted average interest rate as of december   was 
our operations are affected by local  national and worldwide economic conditions 
we have relied on the capital markets  particularly for equity securities  as well as the banking and debt markets  to meet financial commitments and liquidity needs if internally generated cash flow from operations is not adequate to fund our capital requirements 
capital markets in the united states and elsewhere have been experiencing extreme adverse volatility and disruption for more years  due in part to the financial stresses affecting the liquidity of the banking system  the real estate mortgage industry and the financial markets generally 
during the past months  this volatility and disruption has been reduced 
as a result  our access to capital has improved as evidenced by our million equity offering during october if oil commodity prices were to drop precipitously and gas commodity prices stay the same or go lower  the company may not have enough liquidity to cover capital expenditures 
the availability of funds under our credit facility is critical to our company 
the borrowing base is to be redetermined on or about april  if the credit facility s borrowing base is reduced to a level below current borrowings  the company would be obligated to begin reducing the deficiency by within days after the deficiency occurs and the remaining within days after the deficiency occurs 
low commodity prices may restrict our ability to meet our current obligations 
as a result  management has taken several actions to ensure that the company will have sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through december   including a capital expenditure budget which is expected to be funded primarily by discretionary cash flow  entered into put agreements and 
table of contents differential swap agreements for a portion of its production to reduce price volatility and reductions in discretionary expenditures 
as of february   approximately of the company s oil production is covered by put agreements 
if the liquidity of the company should worsen  the company would evaluate other measures to further improve its liquidity  including  the sale of equity or debt securities  entering into joint ventures with third parties  additional commodity price hedging and other monetization of assets strategies 
there is no assurance that the company would be successful in these capital raising efforts if they became necessary to fund operations during during  the company had net income of million of which million represented a loss on derivative financial instruments 
this compares to when the company had net income of million of which million represented a gain on derivative financial instruments and a net loss of million in of which million represented a loss on derivative financial instruments 
at december   current assets were approximately million less than current liabilities 
as of february   the company has a borrowing base of million and million outstanding under the credit facility 
in the future  if natural gas inventories rise to levels such that no natural gas storage capacity exists  certain us natural gas production will need to be reduced or shut in 
additionally  if commodity prices decline to levels that make it uneconomic to produce oil and natural gas  the company or its partners may elect to shut in or reduce production 
as a result  some or all of the company s oil and natural gas production may be shut in or curtailed during the next months  which would have a material adverse effect on operations 
the company s proved reserves increased as of december  compared to prior years 
the increase was primarily due to drilling activities and higher commodity prices 
the company s projects have material lease operating expenses 
our oil operations include a secondary recovery waterflood with significant fixed costs 
during  our oil lease operating expenses were per barrel of oil produced 
our natural gas operations include reinjecting the produced water into deep formations and compressing and transporting the gas with significant fixed costs 
during  our natural gas lease operating expenses were per mcf of gas produced 
the company s proved reserves are based on assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
the company s proved reserves as of december  through december  are listed below

table of contents capital expenditure program at the present time  we are concentrating our activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit and the north wilmington unit 
additionally  we have a drilling project in wyoming referred to as the atlantic rim project 
during  our capital expenditure program approximated million 
the company drilled wells in california producers and no injectors 
the costs associated with the new oil wells in california wells were approximately million and the facility costs were approximately million 
in  the company purchased a sound proofed drilling rig for our wtu and nwu units in california 
during  the company incurred million of assembly costs 
the company estimates that an additional million will be spent on rig maintenance  improvements and assembly costs in additionally  the company drilled gross net well in the atlantic rim project in wyoming 
the costs associated with these new wells were million 
additionally  infrastructure and other costs for the gas wells in wyoming approximated million 
if the company elects not to participate in drilling activities with its partners  it may lose all or a portion of its mineral leases and rights in certain acreage 
as a result  our proved reserves may decline 
also  unless we continue to develop our properties  production may decline and  as a result  reserves would decline 
lastly  complex federal  state and local laws and regulations may adversely affect the cost and feasibility of drilling and completion activities 
our capital expenditure budget is forecasted to be approximately million  million for our california projects and million for our wyoming projects 
however  our budget may change depending upon economic conditions  oil and gas prices and liquidity issues 
in california  we are budgeting approximately million for drilling new wtu directional wells and reworking existing wtu wells  million for infrastructure and geological costs in the wtu and nwu 
in wyoming  we are budgeting million for drilling new atlantic rim wells and million for pipelines  compressors and infrastructure costs in our atlantic rim project 
the final determination regarding whether to drill and complete the budgeted wells and incur the capital expenditures referred to above is dependent upon many factors including  but not limited to the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated crude oil and natural gas prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility and maintaining a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
below  we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas producing activities we account for our oil and gas activities using the full cost method 
as prescribed by full cost accounting rules  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties as well as other internal costs that can be specifically identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs are depleted on the equivalent unit of production method  based on proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  warren is subject to a limitation on capitalized costs 
the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent  plus the cost of unproved properties excluded from amortization  as adjusted for related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
there was no impairment charge in  and the costs of certain unevaluated oil and gas properties and exploratory wells being drilled are not included in the costs subject to amortization 
warren assesses costs not being amortized for possible impairments or reductions in value and if impairments or a reduction in value has occurred  the portion of the carrying cost in excess of the current value is transferred to costs subject to amortization 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters

no dividends may be paid on the common stock as long as there are any accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock 
commencing july  and thereafter  at the election of the holder of our convertible preferred stock  each share of preferred stock is convertible into share of common stock 
the conversion rate for our convertible preferred stock is subject to adjustment in the event of the issuance of common stock as a dividend or distribution on any class of our capital stock  the combination  subdivision or reclassification of the common stock  or the distribution to all holders of common stock of evidences of indebtedness or assets  including securities issued by third parties  but excluding cash dividends or distributions paid out of surplus 
commencing seven years after their respective date of issuance  the preferred stock may be redeemed by the holders at a redemption price equal to the liquidation value of per share  plus accrued but unpaid dividends  if any 
at december   there were  preferred shares outstanding that the company may be required to redeem 
upon receipt of a redemption election  we  at our option  shall either pay the holder cash in an amount equal to per convertible preferred share  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends or stock exchanges  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  to the extent that we have funds legally available for redemption  or 
table of contents issue to the holder shares of common stock in an amount equal to of the cash redemption price and any accrued and unpaid dividends  based on the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock for the trading days immediately preceding the date of the receipt of the written redemption election by the holder  as reported by the nasdaq stock market  or by any exchange or electronic otc listing service on which the shares of common stock are then traded 
in the event that we elect to pay the redemption price in kind with our common stock  for the  shares of preferred stock representing million of redemption price value  notwithstanding the market price of our common stock  we shall not issue to the redeeming preferred stockholders less than their proportionate share of  shares of our shares of common stock  nor be obligated to issue more than  shares of our common stock in full satisfaction of the redemption  subject to adjustment for stock splits  stock dividends and stock exchanges

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity risk our primary market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot regional market prices applicable to our us natural gas production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
we have entered into several commodity derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and gas production 
we believe we will have more predictability of our crude oil and gas revenues as a result of these derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes our open financial derivative positions as of march  related to oil and gas production 
product type contract period volume price per mcf or bbl brent oil put  bbl d nymex oil put  bbl d natural gas differential swap  mcf d this represents a differential spread between nymex natural gas and cig pricing 

table of contents for put options  we typically pay a premium to the counterparty in exchange for the sale of the instrument 
if the index price is below the floor price of the put option  we receive the difference between the floor price and the index price multiplied by the contract volumes less the option premium 
if the index price settles at or above the floor price of the put option  we pay only the option premium 
under a swap contract  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the index price for any settlement period is less than the fixed price  and we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the index price for any settlement period is greater than the fixed price 
interest rate risk we hold investments in us treasury bonds available for sale  which represents securities held in escrow accounts on behalf of the drilling programs and purchasers of certain debentures 
occasionally  we hold us treasury bonds trading securities  which predominantly represent us treasury bonds released from escrow accounts 
the fair market value of these securities will generally increase if the federal discount rate decreases and decrease if the federal discount rate increases 
all of our convertible debt has fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow or fair value risk from market interest rate changes on this debt 
at december   we had debt outstanding under our credit facility of million 
depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the applicable libor period plus the applicable libor margin that ranges from to  or b a base rate loan  or any other obligation other than a libor loan  which has an interest rate equal to the sum of the base rate  calculated to be the higher of i the agent s prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent plus one half percent  plus an applicable base rate margin that ranges from to 
during  the company incurred million of interest under the credit facility of which approximately million of interest was accrued for at december  at december   the weighted average interest rate on our credit line was 
a increase in this rate would result in annual additional interest of million 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  us treasury bonds  collateral security accounts  derivatives and other long term liabilities 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and us treasury bonds approximate fair market value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments or they are reported at fair value 
debentures  derivatives  other long term liabilities and the credit line are recorded at the approximate fair value of such items 
inflation and changes in prices the general level of inflation affects our costs 
salaries and other general and administrative expenses are impacted by inflationary trends and the supply and demand of qualified professionals and professional services 
inflation and price fluctuations affect the costs associated with exploring for and producing natural gas and oil  which have a material impact on our financial performance
