overview continuing operations cardiovascular business thoratec corporation we  our  us  thoratec or the company is the world leader in mechanical circulatory support with a product portfolio to treat the full range of clinical needs for advanced heart failure patients 
we develop  manufacture and market proprietary medical devices used for circulatory support 
for the treatment of heart failure hf patients  we develop  manufacture and market proprietary medical devices used for mechanical circulatory support mcs 
for advanced hf  our primary product lines are our ventricular assist devices vads the thoratec paracorporeal ventricular assist device pvad  the thoratec implantable ventricular assist device ivad  the heartmate left ventricular assist systems heartmate xve  and the heartmate ii left ventricular assist system heartmate ii 
we refer to the pvad and the ivad collectively as the thoratec product line and we refer to the heartmate xve and the heartmate ii collectively as the heartmate product line 
for acute hf  we market the centrimag acute circulatory system centrimag and for pediatric patients the pedimag pedivas acute circulatory system pedimag pedivas 
the pvad  ivad  heartmate xve  heartmate ii  centrimag and pedimag pedivas are approved by the us food and drug administration fda  and conformit europ ene ce mark approved in europe 

table of contents mcs devices supplement the pumping function of the heart in patients with hf 
in most cases  a cannula connects the left ventricle of the heart to a blood pump 
blood flows from the left ventricle to the pump chamber via the cannula  powered by an electric or air driven mechanism that drives the blood through another cannula into the aorta 
from the aorta  the blood then circulates throughout the body 
mechanical or tissue valves enable unidirectional flow in some devices 
currently  the power source remains outside the body for all fda approved mcs devices 
certain mcs devices are implanted internally  while others are placed outside the body 
some external devices are placed immediately adjacent to the body paracorporeal  while other external mcs devices are positioned at a distance from the body extracorporeal 
on august   we announced that we acquired the medical business of levitronix llc levitronix  for an upfront cash payment of million  as well as potential future cash earn out payments of up to million 
this acquisition follows a successful strategic relationship between the two companies 
prior to the acquisition  we provided distribution and clinical support to levitronix in the us for the centrimag  under an agreement that would have expired at the end of we have also collaborated on the development of the fully magnetically levitated motor technology employed in the heartmate iii left ventricular assist system  which is currently in preclinical testing 
our product portfolio of implantable and external mcs devices and graft products is described below 
the heartmate ii the heartmate ii is an implantable  electrically powered  continuous flow  left ventricular assist device consisting of a miniature rotary blood pump designed to provide intermediate and long term mcs 
the heartmate ii is designed to improve survival and quality of life and to provide five to ten years of circulatory support for a broad range of advanced hf patients 
significantly smaller than the heartmate xve and with only one moving part  the heartmate ii is simpler and designed to operate more quietly than pulsatile devices 
heartmate ii received fda approval in april for bridge to transplantation btt and received fda approval for use in hf patients who are not eligible for heart transplantation destination therapy or dt in january in november  the heartmate ii received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in may  the heartmate ii was approved in canada 
during the third quarter of  we launched our new heartmate external peripherals gogear  including new batteries  charger and power module  which are designed to provide an enhanced quality of life for heartmate patients by providing them more freedom and mobility and the ability to more easily resume many aspects of a normal lifestyle 
the heartmate xve the heartmate xve is an implantable  pulsatile  left ventricular assist device for intermediate and longer term mcs 
patients with a heartmate xve do not require anticoagulation drugs  other than aspirin  because of the product s incorporation of proprietary textured surfaces and tissue valves 
the system is comprised of the implantable blood pump as well as the external peripherals  including a wearable controller and batteries  which provide a high degree of patient freedom and mobility 
we discontinued the sale of the heartmate xve at the end of fiscal the heartmate xve received fda approval for btt in december and for dt in april in june  the heartmate xve received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in june  the heartmate xve was approved in canada 
the paracorporeal ventricular assist device the pvad is an external  pulsatile  ventricular assist device  fda approved for btt  including home discharge  and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery and provides left  right and biventricular mcs 
the pvad is a paracorporeal device that is less invasive than implantable vads since only the cannula is implanted 
the paracorporeal nature of the pvad has several benefits including shorter implantation times approximately two hours and the ability to use the device in smaller patients 

table of contents a pneumatic power source drives the pvad 
it is designed for short to intermediate duration use of a few weeks to several months  although this device has supported numerous patients for nine to eighteen months 
offering left  right or biventricular support  the pvad and the ivad  described below  are the only biventricular support systems approved for use as btt 
this characteristic is significant because approximately of btt patients treated with the pvad and the ivad require right as well as left sided ventricular assistance 
the pvad and the ivad are also the only devices approved for both btt and recovery following cardiac surgery 
the pvad incorporates our proprietary biomaterial  thoralon  which has excellent tissue and blood compatibility and is resistant to blood clots 
the pvad received fda approval for btt in december and for recovery post cardiotomy in may in june  the pvad received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in november  the pvad was approved in canada 
the implantable ventricular assist device the ivad is an implantable  pulsatile  ventricular assist device fda approved for btt  including home discharge  and post cardiotomy myocardial recovery and provides left  right or biventricular mcs 
the ivad maintains the same blood flow path  valves and blood pumping mechanism as the pvad  but has an outer housing made of a titanium alloy that makes it suitable for implantation 
the ivad received fda approval for btt and recovery post cardiotomy in august in june  the ivad received ce mark approval  allowing for its commercial sale in europe 
in november  the ivad was approved in canada 
the centrimag the centrimag is an extracorporeal full flow acute surgical support platform incorporating a polycarbonate pump  based on magnetically levitated bearingless motor technology 
the centrimag is k cleared by the fda for use up to six hours in patients requiring short term extracorporeal circulatory support during cardiac surgery 
additionally  centrimag is approved under an fda humanitarian device exemption to be used as a right ventricular assist device for periods of support up to thirty days in patients in cardiogenic shock due to acute right ventricular failure 
in may  levitronix received approval to commence a us pivotal trial to demonstrate safety and effectiveness of the centrimag for periods of support up to days 
the centrimag has ce mark approval in europe to market the product to provide support for up to thirty days for both cardiac and respiratory failure 
in canada  the centrimag is approved for short term cardiopulmonary support 
the pedimag pedivas the pedimag and pedivas are identical  extracorporeal full flow acute surgical support platforms incorporating a polycarbonate pump  based on magnetically levitated bearingless motor technology  designed to provide acute surgical support to pediatric patients 
the brand names differ according to indication for use  duration of support  and regulatory approval 
the pedimag is k cleared by the fda for use  in conjunction with the centrimag console and motor  for support periods of up to six hours 
an investigational device exemption ide has been submitted to the fda in order to begin a us clinical trial examining the safety and probable benefit of the device for use up to days to support pediatric patients 
outside the us  the device is branded as pedivas and has ce mark approval for support durations of up to days for both cardiac and respiratory failure 
in canada  pedivas is approved for short term cardiopulmonary support or extracorporeal life support 
discontinued operations international technidyne corporation itc on november   we sold our wholly owned subsidiary  international technidyne corporation  to itc nexus holding company  inc nexus for million in cash pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  dated as of november   by and between the company and nexus 
for the period ended december   we recorded net loss of million less tax benefit of million for itc primarily related to post close severance payments 
the itc division has been reclassified to discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  long lived asset impairments  warranty provisions  contingent consideration  income taxes  and share based compensation  are updated as appropriate  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales to customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered or service has been performed  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured and there are no further obligations to customers 
delivery of the product is considered to have occurred when shipped 
sales from products are not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
we sell products through our direct sales force and through distributors 
sales through distributors are recognized as revenue upon sale to the distributor as these sales are considered to be final and no right of return or price protection exists 
we recognize sales of certain products to first time customers when it has been determined that the customer has the ability to use the products 
these sales frequently include the sale of products and training services under multiple element arrangements 
training is not considered essential to the functionality of the products 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to training based upon fair market value of the training  which is typically performed on our behalf by third party providers 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated to the training and the products based on the relative fair market value of the training and products 
in determining when to recognize revenue  management makes decisions on such matters as the fair value of the product and training elements when sold together  and customer credit worthiness 
if any of these decisions proves incorrect  the deferred revenue recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or the recorded product sales could be significantly different  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for any fiscal period 
reserves on accounts receivable  inventory and warranty we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is management s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable 
we determine the allowance based on historical write off experience 
past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we believe it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
estimated excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded when inventory levels exceed projected sales volume 
in determining the excess obsolete charges  management makes judgments and estimates on matters such as forecasted sales volume 
actual sales volume may differ from forecasted sales volume and such differences may have a material effect on recorded inventory values 
based on management s estimate  adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess or obsolete inventory 
the sales of our products generally include a limited one year warranty on product quality 
the estimated cost of product warranty claims is accrued at the time the sale is recognized  based on historical experience 
while we believe that historical experience provides a reliable basis for estimating such warranty cost  unforeseen quality issues or component failure rates could result in future costs in excess of such estimates  or alternatively  improved quality and reliability in our products could result in actual expenses that are below those currently estimated 

table of contents long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets  whenever events  changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long lived assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
if these facts and circumstances exist  we assess for recovery by comparing the carrying values of long lived assets with their future undiscounted net cash flows 
if the comparison indicates that impairment exists  long lived assets are written down to their respective fair value based on discounted cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecast of future operating results that is used in the preparation of expected undiscounted cash flows 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
the second step of the process is only performed if a potential impairment exists  and it involves comparing the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
goodwill is considered impaired  and an impairment charge is recorded  if the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of the net assets is less than the carrying value of goodwill 
contingent consideration on august   we acquired of levitronix for an upfront cash payment of million  plus additional cash earn out amounts not to exceed million in aggregate 
the earn out contingent consideration is calculated based on percent of sales from levitronix in excess of sales of approximately million per year over the next four years commencing from the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the contingent consideration is calculated using the income approach  utilizing various revenue assumptions and applying a probability to each outcome 
by applying this method  the estimated undiscounted range of outcomes was from million to million 
the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was estimated and recorded at million  which remained unchanged at december  the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at the estimated fair value at each reporting period with the change in fair value recorded within operating expense within our consolidated statements of operations 
actual amounts paid may differ from the obligations recorded 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax laws that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions 
this process involves our estimate of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting standards for income taxes which require that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
these accounting standards also require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

table of contents we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on accounting standards that prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result  we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process prescribed in the standards 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new exposures 
if we later determine that the exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we will adjust the liability and effect a related change in tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
valuation of share based awards we account for share based compensation costs in accordance with the accounting standards for share based compensation  which requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the fair value of each option on the date of grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model using the single option approach 
we recognize the expense ratably on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  therefore  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the accounting standards require forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
in addition  expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility trends and market based implied volatility 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
in addition  if we employ different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard  the compensation expense that we record in the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
fair value of financial instruments we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available  which may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
financial instruments are primarily comprised of money market funds  auction rate securities  us treasury securities and debt instruments of government agencies  local municipalities  corporate issuers  and derivative instruments 
cash equivalents and investments in general  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
if quoted prices for identical or similar assets are not available  we use internally developed valuation models  whose inputs are unobservable data points that are not corroborated by market data 
derivative instruments we hold non speculative foreign currency forwards to hedge certain foreign currency exposures 
we use internally developed valuation models which project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using significant market based observable inputs including interest rate curves  foreign exchange rates  and forward and spot prices for currencies

continuing operations product sales product sales consisted of the following fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands  except percentages product sales in as compared to  product sales increased million or driven by strong sales volume of heartmate and centrimag products 
the heartmate product line contributed approximately million to the increase  while centrimag contributed approximately million  partially attributable to the levitronix acquisition completed in august which added million from the date of the acquisition through december  the increase was partially offset by decline of approximately million in sales of the thoratec product line partially due to cannibalization by the heartmate product line 
the remaining million were due to decline of other products 
from a regional perspective  us contributed approximately million to the increase  while international sales contributed approximately million 
in the us  heartmate ii centers were added during bringing the total to centers 
internationally  we added centers in  bringing the total to centers 

table of contents in as compared to  product sales increased primarily from an increase in worldwide heartmate ii volume driven by heartmate ii s dt approval received in january  including go gear peripherals introduced in the third quarter of  and an increase in centrimag sales 
the increase in product sales were partially offset by a decline in sales of the heartmate xve and thoratec product lines partially as a result of cannibalization by the heartmate ii

in as compared to  sg a costs primarily increased due to market development initiatives including sales force expansion  increased travel and other selling expenses which were attributed to the higher product sales  and intangible assets amortization in connection with the acquisition of levitronix in august levitronix acquisition related transaction costs of million also contributed to the increase in over the prior year 
in as compared to  sales and marketing costs increased by primarily due to spending on product and market development initiatives  including sales force expansion 
administrative and other costs decreased by million primarily due to million in costs incurred in in connection with the terminated proposed acquisition of heartware international inc heartware offset by an increase in compensation costs and an increase in legal fees related to business development activity 

table of contents research and development fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands  except percentages total research and development expenses research and development r d expenses as a percentage of product sales were approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal in as compared to  r d expenses increased by due to next generation product development costs for heartmate x  heartmate iii  php  heartmate ii peripheral enhancements  and incremental r d activities in connection with the levitronix acquisition

interest expense interest expense primarily relates to cash and non cash interest cost on the senior subordinated convertible notes as follows fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands  except percentages interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs related to senior subordinated convertible notes loss on extinguishment of senior subordinated convertible notes total interest expense not meaningful interest expense  which is comprised primarily of the senior subordinated convertible notes  is calculated using the effective interest rate method which increases interest expense over the term of the debt 
in may  all remaining senior subordinated convertible notes were extinguished 
in  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of million from the conversion of  senior subordinated convertible notes 
interest income and other interest income and other consisted of the following fiscal years annual percentage change in thousands  except percentages interest income foreign currency  net other total interest income and other not meaningful 

table of contents interest income decreased by million in primarily due to lower cash  cash equivalents and investment balances  combined with lower interest rates and yields on the investments 
the lower cash  cash equivalents and investment balances were due to million utilized during the year to extinguish the senior subordinated convertible notes  acquire levitronix for million  and the repurchase of approximately million of common stock in foreign currency  net increased by million in as compared to due to unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in  interest income declined by million as compared to primarily due to a decline in market interest rates  partially offset by an increase in cash and investment balances 
foreign currency losses decreased by million in as compared to due to favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
other income increased by million in as compared to primarily due to higher royalty income earned and the change in the mark to market value of our deferred compensation plan assets during the year 
impairment on investment in we recorded an impairment charge of million for our entire investment in acorn cardiovascular  inc  a start up medical device company 
the impairment charge is included in other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in compared to in this decrease in the annual effective tax rate of was primarily due to a one time reversal of tax reserves related to california research and development credit  valuation allowance recorded in  and favorable return to provision adjustments 
these decreases were partially offset by lower tax exempt income and the write off of certain us deferred tax assets in our effective tax rate was in compared to in this increase in the annual effective tax rate of was primarily due to an increase in pre tax income  fluctuations in return to provision adjustments including a benefit recognized in attributable to changes in state apportionment rates and an increase in the valuation allowance  offset by a reduction in non deductible compensation 
during the fourth quarter of  we realized a tax benefit related to the full year impact of the federal research and development tax credit  which was in part offset by a revaluation of the state apportionment rates due to the divestiture of itc 
discontinued operations discontinued operations incurred a loss of million in compared to a loss of million during during we recorded a charge of million million net loss  less an income tax benefit of million for itc primarily related to post close severance payments 
discontinued operations incurred a loss of million during compared to a loss of million during the increase in the loss from discontinued operations was primarily due to increase in transaction costs and compensation costs related to the sale of itc  lower sales as a result of competitive activity and lower gross margin driven by unfavorable manufacturing variances 
in addition  we recorded a loss from the sale of itc of million in the period 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments consolidated working capital was million as of december   compared with million as of january  included in working capital were cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared to million as of january  the decrease resulted primarily from cash used for the extinguishment of the senior subordinated convertible notes  the levitronix acquisition and repurchases of our common stock during 
table of contents our cash  cash equivalents and investments balance is as follows december  january  january  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term available for sale investments long term available for sale investments total cash and equivalents and available for sale investments we believe that cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments on hand and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations  capital requirements and stock repurchase programs for at least the next twelve months

refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for details 
cash provided by operating activities in  cash provided by operating activities was million primarily due to net income from continuing operations of million  coupled with higher depreciation and amortization  partially attributable to intangible assets obtained from the levitronix acquisition 
in addition  million of non cash interest expense and other  million related to share based compensation expenses  million of tax benefit related to the exercise of stock options also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities 
these non cash contributions were partially offset by a decrease of million related to excess tax benefits from share based compensation and a decrease of million in our net deferred tax liability 
changes in assets and liabilities used additional cash of million primarily due to the increase in inventory in anticipation of higher product sales  offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  accounts payable due to timing of payments  accrued liabilities from the reduction in variable compensation related accrual  and lower income tax payable in the current year 
cash provided by investing activities in  cash provided by investing activities was million  due to net sales and maturity of investments of million  partially offset by the purchase of investments of million  million cash payment to acquire levitronix  and purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
the purchases of property  plant and equipment  related to leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and equipment purchases to support our manufacturing facilities and administration growth 

table of contents cash used in financing activities in  cash used in financing activities was million  which was primarily comprised of million used to extinguish the senior subordinated convertible notes  million used for repurchases of million shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase program authorized  and million used to repurchase vested restricted stock units and awards for settlement of income tax withholding liabilities 
this use was partially offset by proceeds of million related to stock option exercises  million proceeds from stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan  and million from excess tax benefits for share based compensation 
stock repurchase program on november  we announced that our board of directors authorized a new program november program for the repurchase of up to million worth of shares of our common stock 
additionally  the board of directors extended the expiration date for the million remaining under the million share repurchase program authorized by our board of directors on february  program february program to november  during the fourth quarter of  under the february program  we paid an additional million to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
all shares that have been repurchased have reduced our issued and outstanding common stock 
as of december   million is available for repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs 
off balance sheet arrangements letter of credit we maintain an irrevocable standby letter of credit as part of our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is not collateralized 
the letter of credit automatically renews for a month period on june th of each year  unless terminated by one of the parties 
as of december   our letter of credit balance was approximately million 
credit facility on december   we obtained an unsecured revolving credit facility that provides for up to million revolving credit that will expire on december  the interest rate charged on the amounts borrowed is libor plus a margin ranging from to 
the agreement contains financial covenants 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of december  the credit agreement permits us to use the facility for working capital and general corporate purposes 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the revolver 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations total thereafter in millions operating lease obligations a deferred compensation obligations b purchase obligations c total a our operating lease obligations of million are comprised primarily of our various us and switzerland leased facilities 
b our deferred compensation obligations of million are comprised of future distributions to plan participants 
c our purchase obligations include million of supply agreements in effect at december  as of december   the liability for uncertain tax positions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 

table of contents accounting pronouncements refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k  for the section entitled recently issued accounting pronouncements which is incorporated herein by reference item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio and cash equivalents that bear variable interest would have an immaterial impact to interest income  on the consolidated statements of operations  if interest rates would have fallen by basis points 
in addition  if interest rates rise  the market value of our investment portfolio may decline  which could result in a loss if we choose or are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
if interest rates were to rise or fall from current levels by basis points  the change in our net unrealized loss on our short and long term investments would be million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risks 
foreign currency rate fluctuations the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates and is estimated based on the amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contract  taking into account the change in currency exchange rates 
a change in the non functional currency exchange rates as of december  related to our contracts would result in an increase in the unrealized gain or loss on forward currency exchange contracts of million 
the unrealized gains or losses on forward currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in currency exchange rates are expected to approximately offset losses or gains on the currency exposures resulting from our operations
