item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the challenging economic environment has continued to negatively impact consumer confidence and spending in fiscal as a result  consumer spending is pressured and consumers are seeking greater value offerings 
the company is focused on its business transformation plan to become america s neighborhood grocer  which draws upon the company s plays to win strategy 
key drivers of this strategy include simplification of business processes  generation of incremental funding for further price investment and a greater focus on meeting the demands of each neighborhood 
a key tenet for improving sales through the plays to win strategy  is the implementation of an overall pricing philosophy referred to as fair pricing plus promotion 
under this strategy  the company will offer lower  more competitive everyday pricing on non promoted items while continuing to offer compelling weekly promotions to attract customers 
as the strategy unfolds  price investments necessary to fully implement fair pricing plus promotion have  and are expected to continue to  initially reduce identical store sales until such time as unit volumes increase 
another element of the company s strategy is to better match the offerings and experience of each store to its surrounding community  what is referred to as hyper local retailing 
store directors have been given more authority over the items they display and promote so their store better reflects the neighborhood preferences and creates a more relevant in store experience for customers 
the company also believes it can increase sales through greater sales of its private label products as the competitive prices for such products drive additional sales 
the company has launched essential everyday  its national brand equivalent private label offering 
essential everyday s clean packaging and appealing graphics complement the company s other recognized private label brands such as shoppers value  culinary circle and wild harvest 
essential everyday has been introduced across a number of categories  and additional items are being introduced each quarter 
to provide funding for planned price investments  the company is improving its operations through the introduction and implementation of a number of business support tools 
these tools enable management to 
table of contents design more effective promotions  determine more appropriate display sizes  order product quantities that better match sales forecasts  and take actions to improve product availability all based on historical data 
the grocery sector experienced higher than normal levels of commodity inflation during fiscal and fiscal  and the company is anticipating modest inflation to continue in fiscal the company  and the majority of its key competitors  have stated it will generally pass through vendor cost increases in the form of higher retail prices  thus mitigating the potential impact of lower gross margin rates 
the company analyzes inflation by product or product group and evaluates whether to pass on the cost inflation in conjunction with its overall price investment strategy 
the company does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its ability to execute its business strategy

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
vendor funds the company receives funds from many of the vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company 
table of contents receives vendor funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendors products in the company s advertising  display of the vendors products in prominent locations in the company s stores  supporting the introduction of new products into the company s retail stores and distribution system  exclusivity rights in certain categories  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities such as volume commitment rebates  credits for purchasing products in advance of their need and cash discounts for the early payment of merchandise purchases 
the majority of the vendor fund contracts have terms of less than a year  with a small proportion of the contracts longer than one year 
the company recognizes vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold 
vendor funds that have been earned as a result of completing the required performance under the terms of the underlying agreements but for which the product has not yet been sold are recognized as reductions of inventory 
the amount and timing of recognition of vendor funds as well as the amount of vendor funds to be recognized as a reduction to ending inventory requires management judgment and estimates 
management determines these amounts based on estimates of current year purchase volume using forecast and historical data and review of average inventory turnover data 
these judgments and estimates impact the company s reported gross profit  operating earnings loss and inventory amounts 
the historical estimates of the company have been reliable in the past  and the company believes the methodology will continue to be reliable in the future 
based on previous experience  the company does not expect significant changes in the level of vendor support 
however  if such changes were to occur  cost of sales and advertising expense could change  depending on the specific vendors involved 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would consider changing the volume  type and frequency of the advertising  which could increase or decrease its advertising expense 
similarly  the company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on increasing revenues as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the company s stores 
for fiscal  a percent change in total vendor funds earned  including advertising allowances  with no offsetting changes to the base price on the products purchased  would impact gross profit by less than basis points 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all of the company s inventory consists of finished goods 
approximately percent and percent of the company s inventories were valued using the last in  first out lifo method for fiscal and  respectively 
the company uses a combination of the retail inventory method rim and replacement cost method to determine the current cost of its inventory before any lifo reserve is applied 
under rim  the current cost of inventories and the gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the current retail value of inventories 
under the replacement cost method  the most current unit purchase cost is used to calculate the current cost of inventories 
the first in  first out method fifo is used to determine cost for some of the remaining highly perishable inventories 
if the fifo method had been used to determine cost of inventories for which the lifo method is used  the company s inventories would have been higher by approximately and as of february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal  and  inventory quantities in certain lifo layers were reduced 
these reductions resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of fiscal  and purchases 
as a result  cost of sales decreased by  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the company evaluates physical inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date 
although the company has sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for inventory shortages  it is possible that actual results could differ 
as of february   each basis point change in the estimated inventory shortages would impact the allowances for inventory shortages by approximately 
table of contents reserves for closed properties and property  plant and equipment related impairment charges the company maintains reserves for costs associated with closures of retail stores  distribution centers and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  reduced by estimated subtenant rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant rentals and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
owned properties  capital lease properties and the related equipment and leasehold improvements at operating leased properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value 
the company estimates fair value based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers to assist in the valuation 
the expectations on timing of disposition and the estimated sales price or subtenant rentals associated with closed properties  owned or leased  are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates of reserves for closed properties and related impairment charges are adequate  it is possible that market and economic conditions in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
the company s reserve for closed properties was  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  and  net of estimated sublease recoveries of  as of february  the company recognized asset impairment charges of  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives the company reviews goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the reviews consist of comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value at the reporting unit level 
the company s determination of reporting units considers the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of aggregation of each of the components within the traditional retail stores and independent business operating segments 
the significant qualitative and economic characteristics used in determining our components to support their aggregation include types of businesses and the manner in which the components operate  consideration of key impacts to net sales  cost of sales  competitive risks and the extent to which components share assets and other resources 
the company s reporting units are the operating segments of the business which consist of traditional retail stores  hard discount stores  and independent business services 
the company s traditional retail stores reporting unit is comprised of the aggregation of ten traditional retail food store components under a variety of banners  including shoppers  jewel osco  acme  albertson s southern california  albertson s inter mountain west  hornbachers  farm fresh  cub foods  shop n save and shaw s 
the company s hard discount stores reporting unit is comprised of a single component under one banner save a lot 
the independent business reporting unit is comprised of the aggregation of four geographic distribution areas  which are organized based on region components eastern  southeast  midwest and northern 
the fair values of the company s reporting units are determined by using both the market approach  applying a multiple of earnings based on guidelines for publicly traded companies  and the income approach  discounting projected future cash flows based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the rates used to discount projected future cash flows reflect a weighted average cost of capital 
table of contents based on the company s industry  capital structure and risk premiums including those reflected in the current market capitalization 
if management identifies the potential for impairment of goodwill  the fair value of the implied goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded for any excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value 
fair value calculations contain significant judgments and estimates related to each reporting unit s projected weighted average cost of capital  future revenue  profitability  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
when preparing these estimates  management considers each reporting unit s historical results  current operating trends and specific plans in place 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy and market competition 
the company has sufficient current and historical information available to support its judgments and estimates 
however  if actual results are not consistent with the company s estimates  future operating results may be materially impacted 
the company also reviews intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  which primarily consist of trademarks and tradenames  for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the reviews consist of comparing estimated fair value to the carrying value 
fair values of the company s trademarks and tradenames are determined primarily by discounting an assumed royalty value applied to projected future revenues associated with the tradename based on management s expectations of the current and future operating environment 
the royalty cash flows are discounted using rates based on the weighted average cost of capital and the specific risk profile of the tradenames relative to the company s other assets 
these estimates are impacted by variable factors including inflation  the general health of the economy and market competition 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal the company s stock price experienced a significant and sustained decline 
as a result  the company performed reviews of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment  which indicated that the carrying value of traditional retail stores goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives exceeded their estimated fair values 
the company recorded preliminary non cash impairment charges of  comprised of of goodwill and of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives during the third quarter of fiscal the finalization of third quarter impairment charges and the results of the fourth quarter impairment review resulted in an additional non cash impairment charge of including an immaterial finalization to the third quarter preliminary charge 
the fourth quarter charge is comprised of of goodwill and of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and was recorded in the retail food segment 
the impairment charge was due to the significant and sustained decline in the company s market capitalization as of and subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal and updated discounted future cash flows 
all fiscal goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were recorded in the retail food segment 
as a result of the third and fourth quarter reviews  total non cash impairment charges of  were recorded  comprised of  of goodwill and of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
the calculation of the impairment charges contains significant judgments and estimates including weighted average cost of capital  future revenue  profitability  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
rates used in fiscal to discount projected future cash flows  which varied for each reporting unit  ranged between percent and percent 
perpetual growth rates  which also varied for each reporting unit  ranged between percent and percent 
management performed sensitivity analyses on the fair values resulting from the discounted cash flow analysis utilizing alternate assumptions that reflect reasonably possible changes to future assumptions 
for the independent business and hard discount reporting units  a basis point increase in the discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis would not have resulted in either reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment tests 
for the independent business and hard discount reporting units  a basis point decrease in the estimated perpetual sales growth rates utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis would not have resulted in either reporting unit failing the first step of the impairment tests 
the fair value of independent business goodwill exceeded its carrying value by percent and the fair value of the 
table of contents hard discount stores goodwill exceeded its carrying value by greater than percent 
if the company s stock price experiences a significant and sustained decline  or other events or changes in circumstances  such as operating results not meeting plan indicate that impairment may have occurred  the company would reassess the fair value of the implied goodwill compared to the carrying value 
the company s goodwill attributable to each reporting unit consisted of the following reporting unit traditional retail stores hard discount stores independent business goodwill was assigned to the reporting units as of the acquisition date  with no amounts being allocated between reporting units 
self insurance liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  healthcare for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on management s estimate of the ultimate cost of reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported and related expenses  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
in determining its self insurance liabilities  the company performs a continuing review of its overall position and reserving techniques 
since recorded amounts are based on estimates  the ultimate cost of all incurred claims and related expenses may be more or less than the recorded liabilities 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  healthcare and general and automobile liability is subject to a degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  regulatory changes  benefit level changes and actual claim settlement patterns 
the majority of the self insurance liability for workers compensation is related to claims occurring in california 
california workers compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state s politicians  insurers and providers 
in recent years  there has been an increase in the number of legislative reforms and judicial rulings affecting the handling of claim activity 
the impact of many of these variables on ultimate costs is difficult to estimate 
the effects of changes in such estimated items are included in results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed 
such changes may be material to the results of operations and could occur in a future period 
if  in the future  the company was to experience significant volatility in the amount and timing of cash payments compared to its earlier estimates  the company would assess whether to continue to discount these liabilities 
the company had self insurance liabilities of approximately  net of the discount of  and  net of the discount of  as of february  and february   respectively 
as of february   each basis point change in the discount rate would impact the self insurance liabilities by approximately benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other postretirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participant s years of service  compensation  and age at retirement or termination 
effective december   the company authorized amendments to the supervalu retirement plan and certain supplemental executive retirement benefit plans whereby service crediting ended in these plans and no employees will become eligible to participate in these plans after december  pay increases will continue to be reflected in the amount of benefit earned in these plans until december  
table of contents the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  compensation retirement benefits  in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost 
asc requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is a component of stockholders equity 
while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants  the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
see note benefit plans for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses 
the company reviews and selects the discount rate to be used in connection with its pension and other postretirement obligations annually 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits 
the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is determined based on the portfolio s actual and target composition  current market conditions  forward looking return and risk assumptions by asset class  and historical long term investment performance 
the year annual average rate of return on pension assets for fiscal and fiscal are lower than the assumed long term rate of return of and percent due to the unprecedented decline in the economy and the credit market turmoil during fiscal and the year rolling average annualized return for investments made in a manner consistent with our target allocations have generated average returns of approximately based on returns from to the company expects that the markets will recover to the assumed long term rate of return

the company reviews performance risk related to its guarantees of independent retail customers based on internal measures of credit performance 
as of february   the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the company would be required to make in the event of default of all guarantees was and represented on a discounted basis 
based on the indemnification agreements  personal guarantees and results of the reviews of performance risk  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
accordingly  no amount has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheets for these contingent obligations under the company s guarantee arrangements 
the company is contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
the company could be required to satisfy the obligations under the leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of the company s assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available  the company believes the likelihood that it will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote

the company made contributions to these plans  and recognized expense  of  and in  and  respectively 
company contributions to these plans could increase in the near term

furthermore  if the company was to significantly reduce contributions  exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans  it could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal that would require the company to fund its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested benefits 
based on the assessment of the most recent information available  the company believes that most of the multiemployer plans to which it contributes are underfunded 
the company is only one of a number of employers contributing to these plans and the underfunding is not a direct obligation or liability of the company 
however  the company has attempted  as of february   to estimate its proportionate share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which the company contributes  based on the ratio of its contributions to the total of all contributions to these plans in a year 
as of february   the estimate of the company s share of the underfunding of multiemployer plans to which it contributes was  pre tax  or  after tax 
this represents an increase in the estimated proportionate share of the underfunding of approximately 
table of contents  pre tax  or  after tax  as of february   compared to february  the increase in the amount of underfunding is attributable to the changes in contribution rates resulting from renegotiated collective bargaining agreements and lower than anticipated return on assets

in fiscal  the company contributions to multiemployer plans decreased approximately percent over the prior year  primarily due to store closures and reductions in headcount 
in fiscal  the company contributions to multiemployer plans decreased approximately percent over the prior year mainly due to store closures  reductions in headcount and previously announced market exits 
in fiscal  the company expects to contribute approximately to the multiemployer pension plans  subject to the outcome of collective bargaining and capital market conditions 
furthermore  if the company were to significantly reduce contributions  exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans  it could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal that would require the company to record a withdrawal liability 
any withdrawal liability would be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with accounting standards 
the company s proportionate share of underfunding described above is an estimate and could change based on the results of collective bargaining efforts  investment returns on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by trustees who manage the plans benefit payments and requirements under the pension protection act of and section e of the internal revenue code 
the company also makes contributions to multiemployer health and welfare plans in amounts set forth in the related collective bargaining agreements 
a small minority of collective bargaining agreements contain reserve requirements that may trigger unanticipated contributions resulting in increased healthcare expenses 
if these healthcare provisions cannot be renegotiated in a manner that reduces the prospective healthcare cost as the company intends  the company s selling and administrative expenses could increase in the future
