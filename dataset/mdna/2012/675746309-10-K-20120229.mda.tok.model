item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  unless otherwise indicated introduction unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively 
the following discussion of our results of operations  financial condition and capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview operations summary the litton acquisition on september   the homeq acquisition on september  and the altisource separation on august  have significantly impacted our consolidated operating results 
the operating results of the litton loan servicing and homeq servicing businesses are included in the servicing segment since their respective acquisition dates 
effective with the separation  ocwen ceased to record operating results from the mortgage services  financial services and technology products segments 
the following table summarizes our consolidated operating results for the years indicated 
we have provided a more complete discussion of operating results in the segments section 
for the years ended december  change to to consolidated revenue    operating expenses    income from operations    other expense  net    income from continuing operations before taxes   income tax expense    income loss from continuing operations   income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  net income    net income loss attributable to non controlling interests net income attributable to ocn   segment income loss from continuing operations before taxes servicing    mortgage services  financial services  technology products  corporate items and other    excluding the revenues earned by gss and intersegment revenues of os that were eliminated in consolidation  os revenues were  for the year ended december  excluding the expenses of gss and bms and intersegment expenses of os that were eliminated in consolidation  os operating expenses were  for the year ended december  versus residential servicing and subservicing fees were higher in as a result of loan modifications and the growth in the average servicing portfolio that included approximately billion acquired on september  related to the litton acquisition and the effect of the homeq portfolio for a full year in as compared to four months in operating expenses increased slightly in higher amortization of msrs and the effects of a substantial increase in staffing to service the larger portfolio were largely offset by lower non recurring expenses related to the litton acquisition as compared to those incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition in and a decline in litigation related expenses 
non recurring expenses related to the litton acquisition were  in versus  for the homeq acquisition in in addition  litigation related expenses were higher during due to  of litigation expense incurred in connection with the adverse verdict in a vendor dispute and the settlement of the mdl proceeding 
income from operations increased by  or  in as compared to other expense  net increased by  primarily due to an increase of  in interest expense on borrowings related to the homeq and litton acquisitions  including the write off of  of unamortized discount and deferred debt issuance costs as the result of the prepayment of  on the  senior secured term loan 
also affecting other expense  net are  of losses on derivatives in  including  of unrealized losses on foreign exchange forward contracts that we entered into to hedge against the effects of changes in the value of the indian rupee 
also  includes  of gains related to affordable housing investments that we sold 
these increases in other expense were partly offset by  of gains on extinguishment of debt in and the effects of  of realized and unrealized losses on auction rate securities and a  write off of a commercial real estate investment in income tax expense recognized in was reduced by the release of a reserve predominantly related to deductions associated with a servicing advance finance structure and statute expirations 
the reserve for this item was recorded in versus residential servicing fees were higher than as a result of fees from hamp modifications and the effects of billion of upb additions to the servicing portfolio including approximately billion on september  related to the homeq acquisition and billion added by the saxon msr acquisition in the second quarter 
however  process management fees and other revenues declined as a result of the separation 
operating expenses increased slightly in despite the separation because of non recurring expenses of  associated with the homeq acquisition and because of litigation expense of  incurred in connection with the cartel verdict and the proposed settlement of the mdl proceeding 
income from operations declined by  or  in as compared to other expense  net increased due to higher interest expense on borrowings related to the homeq acquisition of  and realized losses on sales of our remaining auction rate securities of  other expense  net also includes a  write off of a commercial real estate investment 
these increases in expenses were partially offset by gains of  from the sale of our general partnership interests in three affordable housing projects during the fourth quarter 
income from continuing operations before income taxes was  for as compared to  for the former os segments were included in our results through august  and generated income from continuing operations before income taxes of  for the year ended december  the provision for income taxes was reduced by the effect of the reversal of  of reserves related to income taxes 
the net loss for includes the  income tax effect associated with the separation 
discontinued operations for includes an income tax benefit of  recorded in the third quarter related to our recognition of additional tax losses on our former investment in bok 
change in financial condition summary the overall increase in our assets of  or during was principally the result of the following changes cash increased by  total advances increased by  due primarily to  of advances acquired in connection with the litton acquisition offset in part by a reduction in advances on the pre existing portfolio 
msrs increased by  due primarily to purchase of  related to the litton acquisition  offset by amortization expense of receivables increased by  due primarily to a  increase in current income taxes receivable 
goodwill increased by  as a result of the litton acquisition 
investments in unconsolidated entities increased by  due primarily to the  investment in correspondent one offset in part by distributions received from asset management entities 
other assets increased by  primarily as a result of a  increase in debt service accounts as a result of the new litton advance financing facility offset by the repayment of a  note receivable 
the  of debt issuance costs we incurred in connection with the new  senior secured loan was offset in part by the write off of the remaining debt issuance costs related to the  senior secured term loan entered into in connection with the homeq acquisition which we fully repaid in liabilities increased by  or  during primarily because of the following items match funded liabilities increased by  reflecting  of notes issued in connection with the financing of advances that we acquired as part of the litton acquisition  of which  was outstanding at december  this was partially offset by repayments of  on the homeq advance facility and  of paydowns on other facilities 
we used the  of net proceeds from our common stock offering in november to temporarily reduce our borrowings to fund advances rather than invest the proceeds at current short term investment rates that our below our effective cost of borrowing 
we increased our advance borrowings in in order to release these proceeds to fund servicing acquisitions 
lines of credit and other secured borrowings increased by  primarily due to the  senior secured term loan facility that we entered into in connection with the litton acquisition net of an  discount 
this increase was offset by principal payments of  to repay the  senior secured term loan facility   to repay the fee reimbursement advance facility and  of mandatory repayments on the new senior secured term loan 
the repayment of the homeq senior secured term loan resulted in the write off of the remaining discount in other liabilities increased by  primarily due to the liabilities we assumed and subsequently incurred in connection with the litton acquisition 
this increase was offset in part by a decline in litigation reserves related to settled cases and the write off of deferred income related to the fee reimbursement advance facility that we repaid in liquidity summary we define liquidity as unencumbered cash balances plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity 
our liquidity as of december   as measured by cash and available credit  was  an increase of  or  from december  at december   our cash position was  compared to  at december  our available credit on collateralized but unused advance financing capacity increased to  at december  compared to  at december  the increase in available credit was principally the result of our use of the net proceeds from our common stock offering to temporarily reduce borrowings and an increase in the amount of collateral eligible to be pledged under one of our facilities 
these increases were partially offset by our success reducing advances from december  which resulted in a lower amount of advances pledged to our advance financing facilities 
our investment policies emphasize principal preservation by limiting investments to include securities issued by the us government  a us agency or a us gse money market mutual funds money market demand deposits demand deposit accounts we regularly monitor and project cash flow to minimize liquidity risk 
in assessing our liquidity outlook  our primary focus is on maintaining cash and unused borrowing capacity that is sufficient to meet the needs of the business 
at december    of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused 
however  as noted above  the amount of collateral pledged to these facilities limits additional borrowing  and only  of this amount is readily available 
we may utilize the unused borrowing capacity in the servicing business in the future by pledging additional qualifying collateral to these facilities 
in order to reduce fees charged by lenders which we recognize as interest expense  we maintain unused borrowing capacity at a level that we consider prudent relative to the current levels of advances and match funded advances and to meet our funding needs for reasonably foreseeable changes in advances 
interest rate risk summary interest rate risk is a function of i the timing of re pricing and ii the dollar amount of assets and liabilities that re price at various times 
we are exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest rate sensitive liabilities mature or re price at different speeds  or on different bases  than interest earning assets 
we have executed a hedging strategy aimed at largely neutralizing the impact of changes in interest rates within a certain period based on the projected excess of variable rate debt over cash and float balances 
as of december   the notional amount of our outstanding hedges was less than the net exposure of projected variable rate debt and cash and float balances for the next several years 
future variances between the projected excess of variable rate debt over cash and float balances and actual results could result in our becoming over hedged or under hedged 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our use of derivatives 
critical accounting policies our ability to measure and report our operating results and financial position is heavily influenced by the need to estimate the impact or outcome of future events 
our critical accounting policies relate to the estimation and measurement of these risks 
because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties  an understanding of these policies is fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a summary of our more subjective and complex accounting policies as they relate to our overall business strategy 
valuation and amortization of residential mortgage servicing rights our most significant business is our servicing business 
msrs are an intangible asset that represents the right to service a portfolio of mortgage loans 
we generally obtain msrs by purchasing them from the owners of the mortgage loans 
as of december   we held residential msrs with a carrying value of  and an estimated fair value of  we account for our residential msrs using the amortization method 
all newly acquired msrs are initially measured at fair value 
we amortize the balance of servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess servicing assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date 
we determine estimated net servicing income using the estimated future balance of the underlying mortgage loan portfolio  which  absent new purchases  declines over time from prepayments and scheduled loan amortization 
we adjust amortization prospectively in response to changes in projections of future cash flows 
we group the loans that we service into strata based on one or more of the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the risk factors used to assign loans to strata include the credit score fico of the borrower  the loan to value ratio and the default risk 
our primary strata include subprime alt a high loan to value we estimate the fair value of our msrs by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing assumptions that we believe are used by market participants 
the significant components of the estimated future cash flows for msrs include rate at which upb declines interest rate used for computing the cost of servicing advances servicing fees and ancillary income delinquencies cost of servicing interest rate used for computing float earnings discount rate compensating interest expense we also generate internal valuations for management purposes that use the same inputs but reference our historical experience rather than assumptions based on the experience of other industry participants 
the following table provides the range of prepayment speed and delinquency assumptions expressed as a percentage of upb by strata projected for the five year period beginning december  prepayment speed delinquency subprime alt a high loan to value the primary assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of msrs by strata as of december  include the cost of financing advances month libor plus  float earnings month libor  a discount rate and the cost of servicing representing industry averages  which vary by strata and ranged from in dollars per year for a performing alt a loan to  in dollars per year for a loan in foreclosure 
changes in these assumptions are generally expected to affect our results of operations as follows increases in prepayment speeds generally reduce the value of our msrs as the underlying loans prepay faster which causes accelerated msr amortization  higher compensating interest payments and lower overall servicing fees  partially offset by a lower overall cost of servicing  increased float earnings on higher float balances and lower interest expense on decreased servicing advance balances 
increases in delinquencies generally reduce the value of our msrs as the cost of servicing increases during the delinquency period  and the amounts of servicing advances and related interest expense also increase 
increases in the discount rate reduce the value of our msrs due to the lower overall net present value of the net cash flows 
increases in interest rate assumptions will increase interest expense for financing servicing advances although this effect is partially offset because rate increases will also increase the amount of float earnings we recognize 
we perform an impairment analysis of our msrs by strata based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value 
to the extent the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount for any strata we recognize an impairment valuation allowance 
deferred tax assets the use of estimates and the application of judgment are involved in the determination of our overall tax provision and the evaluation of the realizability of our gross deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of  we conduct periodic evaluations of positive and negative evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset can be realized in future periods 
among the factors considered in this evaluation are estimates of future taxable income  future reversals of temporary differences  tax character ordinary versus capital and the impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented if warranted 
we assess the amount of the valuation allowance each quarter 
as a result of this evaluation  we concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary at december  goodwill we test goodwill for impairment annually or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net carrying value 
effective with our adoption of asu asc  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of  we have the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary 
factors that we consider in the qualitative assessment include general economic conditions  conditions of the industry and market in which we operate  regulatory developments  cost factors and our overall financial performance 
if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment or if we determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value  a two step quantitative test is required 
under the two step impairment test  we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its estimated net carrying value including goodwill 
we derive the fair value of reporting units based on valuation techniques that we believe market participants would use discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
our qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment testing involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on the part of management 
from time to time  we may obtain assistance from third parties in our quantitative evaluation 
the discounted cash flow valuation methodology uses projections of future cash flows and includes assumptions concerning future operating performance  discount rates and economic conditions that may differ from actual future results achieved 
in projecting our cash flows  we use projected growth rates or  where applicable  the projected prepayment rate 
for the discount rate  we use a rate which reflects our weighted average cost of capital determined based on our industry and size risk premiums based on our market capitalization 
at december   the  balance of goodwill is comprised of  related to the homeq acquisition on september  and  related to the litton acquisition on september   both of which are included in the servicing segment 
we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill as of august st of each year 
based on our annual assessment  we determined that goodwill was not impaired 
beginning in  our annual impairment test will include the goodwill related to the litton acquisition 
litigation we monitor our litigation matters  including advice from external legal counsel  and regularly perform assessments of these matters for potential loss accrual and disclosure 
we establish reserves for settlements  judgments on appeal and filed and or threatened claims for which we believe it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
segment results and financial condition for the servicing segment and for corporate items and other  the following section discusses the changes in financial condition during the year ended december  and the pre tax results of operations for the annual periods ended december   and our former loans and residuals segment and asset management vehicles segment are included in corporate items and other effective january  due to the separation  neither the assets and liabilities  nor the operations of the mortgage services  financial services and technology products segments are included in our financial results subsequent to august  we have restated segment results for the and periods to conform to the current segment structure 
servicing the following table presents selected results of operations of our servicing segment for the years ended december revenue servicing and subservicing fees residential    commercial    process management fees    other  total revenue    operating expenses compensation and benefits    amortization of servicing rights    servicing and origination    technology and communications    professional services    occupancy and equipment    other operating expenses    total operating expenses    income from operations    other income expense interest income interest expense    gain loss on debt redemption   other  net   total other expense  net    income from continuing operations before income taxes  the following table provides selected operating statistics at or for the years ended december change from to to residential assets serviced unpaid principal balance performing loans    non performing loans    non performing real estate   total residential assets serviced   average residential assets serviced   prepayment speed average cpr percent of total upb servicing portfolio subservicing portfolio non performing residential assets serviced  excluding freddie mac number of performing loans    non performing loans    non performing real estate    total number of residential assets serviced  average number of residential assets serviced   percent of total number servicing portfolio subservicing portfolio non performing residential assets serviced  excluding freddie mac residential servicing and subservicing fees loan servicing and subservicing    hamp fees    late charges    loan collection fees    custodial accounts float earnings    other    financing costs average balance of advances and match funded advances  average borrowings    interest expense on borrowings   facility costs included in interest expense   discount amortization included in interest expense  effective average interest rate average month libor average employment india and other    united states total    collections on loans serviced for others   performing loans include those loans that are current and those loans for which borrowers are making scheduled payments under loan modification  forbearance or bankruptcy plans 
we consider all other loans to be non performing 
subprime loans represent the largest category  or strata  of the residential loans that we service 
at december   we serviced  subprime loans with a upb of  this compares to  subprime loans with a upb of  at december  and  subprime loans with a upb of  at december  excluding the litton portfolio that we acquired on september   the upb and the number of non performing residential assets serviced as a percentage of the total portfolio were and  respectively at december  excluding the homeq and saxon portfolios acquired in  the upb and number of non performing residential assets serviced as a percentage of the total portfolio were and  respectively  at december  by june   we had repaid the  balance outstanding under the  senior secured term loan 
the repayments included  of prepayments in addition to the mandatory quarterly repayments of  these prepayments resulted in a write off to interest expense of  of debt discount and  of deferred debt issuance costs 
excluding these additional costs  the effective annual interest rate would have been for this rate declined from  principally because of a decline in facility costs charged on certain facilities and an increase in average borrowings relative to facility costs which resulted in a significant decline in the proportion of interest expense represented by the amortization of facility costs 
includes an average of employees of litton 
the average does not include  employees transferred to ocwen as a result of the homeq acquisition  who were terminated prior to year end 
newly hired ocwen employees in india  uruguay and the united states are now principally responsible for the servicing related duties for the loans acquired from litton and homeq 
the following table provides information regarding the changes in our portfolio of residential assets serviced amount of upb count portfolio at beginning of year   additions    runoff     portfolio at end of year   versus residential servicing and subservicing fees for were higher than because of a increase in the average upb of residential assets serviced principally as a result of the litton and homeq acquisitions and because of a increase in modifications 
servicing fees for include  earned on the litton portfolio for the period from the acquisition date on september  through december  at december   the percentage of upb representing servicing rather than subservicing was  an increase as compared to on december  this increase was a result of the billion of upb that we acquired in the litton acquisition 
revenue increased relative to average upb for to as compared to for due primarily due to a higher mix of servicing versus subservicing as a result of the saxon msr  homeq and litton acquisitions 
the effect on revenues of the litton acquisition was tempered by the fact that initial revenues from newly acquired servicing are principally the contractual servicing fee and late fees 
other ancillary revenues  which are driven by the resolution of non performing loans  ramp up gradually in the first year after the acquisition 
when we return a loan to performing status  we generally recognize revenue in the form of deferred servicing fees and late fees 
for loans modified under hamp  however  we earn hamp fees in place of late fees 
excluding hamp fees  we recognized loan servicing fees and late charges of  and  during and  respectively  as a result of modifications completed 
in addition  we earned total hamp fees of  and  in and  respectively 
these amounts included hamp success fees of  and  in and  respectively on loans that were still performing at the one year anniversary of their modification 
we completed  modifications during  up from the  modifications completed during in  of completed modifications were hamp as compared to in in late january  the federal government announced that it was extending the hamp program through december in addition  the new hamp increases incentives for principal reduction modifications  extends the program to renter occupied investment properties  and makes the program more flexible for borrowers with certain large non mortgage debts such as medical obligations 
as of december   we estimate that the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments was  compared to  as of december  the increase is primarily due to the billion of servicing upb acquired in the litton acquisition 
process management fee revenues are primarily comprised of referral commissions for sales of foreclosed residential real estate through our network of brokers 
process management fees also include fees earned from altisource in connection with the preparation of foreclosure and similar documents on loans that have defaulted 
in future periods  we expect a substantial decline in document preparation fees as we align with new freddie mac and fannie mae guidelines that restrict certain fees 
operating expenses increased by  amortization of msrs increased by  in due to  of amortization attributed to litton and an increase of  related to homeq offset in part by a decline in amortization on pre existing msrs 
expenses incurred in connection with the litton acquisition  excluding amortization of msrs  were  and include severance  warn act compensation and other benefits of  professional fees of  technology and communication costs of  and occupancy and equipment costs of  this increase in operating expenses attributed to the litton acquisition in were offset by similar expenses incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition in of  which included severance and warn act compensation of  occupancy and equipment costs of  and professional fees of  as described below 
excluding operating expenses related to the litton and homeq acquisitions  as well as amortization of msrs  operating expenses increased by  from to  as we increased our staffing in india  uruguay and the united states to manage the increase in the size of the servicing portfolio 
excluding litton personnel  average staffing in india and uruguay increased by a combined and in the united states by 
total operating expenses for were of average upb as compared to for the increase in our overall delinquency rates from of total upb at december  to at december  is largely due to much higher delinquencies at boarding for the litton portfolio 
excluding the litton portfolio  the upb of non performing residential assets serviced as a percentage of the total portfolio was at december  excluding the effects of new acquisitions or of any changes to foreclosure processes that may occur during  we expect overall delinquency rates to decline  however  this outcome is not assured 
prepayment speed was percentage points higher in primarily due to an increase in regular principal amortization and principal reduction modifications 
real estate sales and other involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of average cpr for with regular principal payments  principal reduction modifications and other voluntary payoffs accounting for the remaining 
for  involuntary and voluntary reductions accounted for and  respectively  of average cpr 
interest expense on borrowings for was higher than in this increase was principally the result of an increase in average borrowings on advance facilities as a result of the homeq and litton acquisitions and the closing of the  senior secured term loan related to the litton acquisition on september  also contributing to the increase was the repayment of the  senior secured term loan related to the homeq acquisition  including  of accelerated prepayments on this loan in these prepayments resulted in a write off to interest expense of  of related debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs 
interest expense for also includes  of net settlements related to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during the second quarter of as compared to  of such settlements in these increases were partly offset by lower spreads on advance facilities  particularly the litton advance facility 
average borrowings of the servicing segment increased by during as compared to as average advances and match funded advances increased by during the same period because of advances and msrs acquired as part of the homeq and litton acquisitions 
versus residential servicing and subservicing fees increased due to the increase in the upb of residential assets serviced and an increase in modifications 
the average upb of residential assets serviced was higher in while residential servicing and subservicing fees increased by 
servicing fees for include  earned on the homeq portfolio for the period from the acquisition date of september  through december  at december   the percentage of upb representing servicing rather than subservicing was  a increase as compared to on december  this increase was a result of the billion of servicing upb that we acquired in the homeq acquisition and the billion of upb that we acquired in the saxon msr acquisition 
however  revenue declined relative to average upb in as compared to due primarily to a higher mix of subservicing in prior to our acquisition of the homeq and saxon servicing portfolios and to lower initial revenue yield on these acquired portfolios 
the effect on revenues of the homeq and saxon msr acquisitions was tempered by the fact that initial revenues from newly acquired servicing are principally the contractual servicing fee and late fees 
other ancillary revenues  which are driven by the resolution of non performing loans  ramp up gradually in the first year after the acquisition 
excluding hamp fees  we recognized loan servicing fees and late charges of  and  during and  respectively  as a result of modifications completed 
hamp fees were  and  in and  respectively 
hamp success fees that we earned on loans that were still performing at the one year anniversary of their modification represent  of the total hamp fees in we earned no success fees in  the first year of hamp 
we completed a total of  modifications during as compared to  during in  of completed modifications were hamp as compared to in as of december   we estimate that the balance of uncollected and unrecognized servicing fees related to delinquent borrower payments was  compared to  as of december  the increase in is primarily due to the billion of servicing upb acquired in the homeq acquisition and the billion of servicing upb that we acquired in the saxon msr acquisition in the second quarter 
process management fees  revenues primarily comprised of referral commissions for residential reo properties sold through our network of brokers  were  lower in largely due to a decline in the number of properties sold 
sales of reo declined as loan modifications and short sales increased and as the foreclosure timeline lengthened 
partly offsetting the decline in commissions was a  increase in fees earned from altisource in connection with the preparation of foreclosure and similar documents on loans that have defaulted 
prior to the separation in august  servicing received a share of such fees from the former technology products segment as a reduction of allocated technology and communication expense 
operating expenses increased by  primarily due to  of expenses incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition  including severance and warn act compensation of  occupancy and equipment costs of  and professional fees of  occupancy and equipment costs include lease termination costs of  and a depreciation charge of  to write off leasehold improvements in connection with our decision to shutdown the leased homeq facilities that we acquired in sacramento  california and raleigh  north carolina 
we also established a  reserve in connection with the proposed settlement of the mdl proceeding including  in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter 
corporate overhead expenses allocated to servicing increased by  primarily due to a decline in the relative size of the non servicing segments following the spin off of the former os segments to altisource in august in addition  the effect of the separation on our recognition of default document preparation fees as described above increased operating expenses by  in excluding the expenses incurred in connection with the homeq acquisition and the reserve accrual for the mdl proceeding  operating expenses in the servicing segment increased by  or  in  which is substantially less than the growth in average upb 
the decline in the normalized expense ratio is attributable to lower amortization expense relative to upb as long term cpr expectations decreased and low incremental operating expense as upb increases 
the overall delinquency rates at the end of and are similar 
within these composite totals  the delinquency rate on the portfolio that existed at the end of declined substantially in  but this decline was offset by higher delinquency rates on the newly acquired homeq and saxon portfolios 
delinquency rates on both the homeq and saxon portfolios have declined since boarding but are still higher than the rate for the prior portfolios 
excluding the effects of any new acquisitions or of any changes to foreclosure processes that may occur in  we expect overall delinquency rates to decline which represents a continuation of current trends 
the increase in total advances is the result of advances acquired as part of the homeq and saxon msr acquisitions 
excluding advances related to the homeq and saxon portfolios  total advances declined by  in we expect advances to continue to decline in before any new acquisitions or foreclosure process changes 
prepayment speed was lower in primarily due to a decline in real estate sales as loan modifications and short sales increased and as the foreclosure timeline lengthened 
real estate sales and other involuntary liquidations accounted for approximately of prepayments during as compared to approximately in interest expense on borrowings for was higher than principally because of an increase in average borrowings on advance facilities  the closing of the  senior secured term loan  higher average interest rates on the subordinated notes on the homeq advance facility and the costs associated with the increase in unused advance financing capacity 
these increases were partly offset by lower spreads on advance facilities 
average servicing borrowings increased by during as compared to as average advances and match funded advances increased by during the same period 
interest expense for includes  of net settlements related to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during the second quarter of the following table shows selected assets and liabilities of our servicing segment as of december advances   match funded advances   mortgage servicing rights residential   receivables  net   goodwill   debt service accounts   prepaid lender fees and debt issuance costs  net  other   total assets   match funded liabilities   lines of credit and other secured borrowings  accrued expenses   payable to servicing and subservicing investors  checks held for escheat   servicing liabilities   accrued interest payable   deferred income  other   total liabilities   overall  advances increased in primarily due to the acquisition of  of advances in connection with the litton acquisition offset in part by a reduction in advances on the pre existing portfolio 
excluding the effect of any new acquisitions or significant foreclosure process changes  we expect advances to continue to decline  however  there is no assurance that this will occur 
we acquired  of msrs as part of the litton acquisition 
these additions were offset in part by amortization of  receivables include reimbursable expenditures due from investors and amounts to be recovered from the custodial accounts of the trustees 
we recorded  of goodwill in connection with the litton acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the litton acquisition 
the balances required to be maintained in debt service accounts were higher due to the funding of a new account related to the match funded advance facility entered into in connection with the litton acquisition 
this increase was partly offset by declining balance requirements related to the other match funded facilities as a result of repayments 
on september   we entered into a new senior secured term loan facility agreement and borrowed  that was used to fund a portion of the litton acquisition as well as for general corporate purposes 
we incurred  of fees in connection with this senior secured term loan 
these fees and  of original issue discount are being amortized over the five year term of the loan 
in september  we executed a  senior secured term loan that was used to fund a portion of the homeq acquisition 
at december   the outstanding principal balance of this loan was  and the unamortized discount and debt issuance costs were  and  respectively 
we repaid the outstanding balance of this loan during the first and second quarters of and wrote off the remaining discount and debt issue costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these loans 
the balance of match funded liabilities increased because of  of debt incurred in connection with the establishment of a new facility to finance advances that we acquired as part of the litton acquisition 
the outstanding balance of this new facility was  at december  this increase was partly offset by a  decline in borrowings under the homeq advance financing facility because of advance reduction 
accrued expenses at december  related to the litton acquisition were  including  for employee termination benefits 
we assumed  of accrued expenses in connection with the litton acquisition  including accruals for employee salaries  benefits and other related compensation costs  legal fees and litigation reserves 
we also assumed servicing liabilities with a fair value of  and an obligation for checks held for escheat of  the balance at december  includes the  accrual established in connection with the mdl proceeding which we settled in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on other liabilities 
the balance represents amounts due to investors in connection with loans we service under servicing and subservicing agreements the balance at december  included  of deferred income associated with the fee reimbursement advance facility that was being amortized to earnings over the five year life of the related debt as a reduction of interest expense 
the unamortized balance was written off upon the repayment of the related debt during september and included in the gain on extinguishment of debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the fee reimbursement advance facility

equity total equity amounted to  at december  as compared to  at december  this increase of  is due to the net proceeds of  from the public offering of  shares of common stock in november and net income of  the exercise of stock options and the recognition of compensation related to employee share based awards also contributed to the increase in equity in income tax expense income tax expense was   and  for  and  respectively

as of december   we no longer had any low income housing tax credits available to reduce future taxable income 
income tax expense on income before income taxes differs from amounts that would be computed by applying the federal corporate income tax rate of primarily because of the effect of foreign taxes and foreign tax rates  foreign income with an indefinite deferral from us taxation  losses from consolidated variable interest entities vies  state taxes and changes in the liability for selected tax items 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of taxes at the statutory rate to actual income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for reflects additional tax expense of  related to an increase in the liability for selected tax items predominately related to state tax positions 
the effective rate for reflects a benefit from the release of a reserve of  predominantly related to deductions associated with a servicing advance finance structure and with statute expirations 
the reserve for these items had been recorded in prior years 
our effective tax rate for also includes a non cash benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for includes a non cash benefit of approximately associated with the recognition of certain foreign deferred tax assets  offset by resulting from a non cash increase in our liability for selected tax items related to recognized deferred tax assets arising from deductibility of losses in a servicing advance finance structure 
liquidity and capital resources as noted in the overview liquidity section  our liquidity as of december   as measured by unencumbered cash plus unused  collateralized advance financing capacity was  an increase of  or  from december  at december   our cash position was  compared to  at december  we have invested cash that is in excess of our immediate operating needs primarily in money market deposit accounts 
investment policy and funding strategy 
our primary sources of funds for near term liquidity are collections of servicing fees and ancillary revenues  collections of prior servicer advances in excess of new advances  proceeds from match funded liabilities  and proceeds from lines of credit and other secured borrowings 
in addition to these near term sources  potential additional long term sources of liquidity include proceeds from the issuance of debt securities and equity capital  although we cannot assure you that they will be available on terms that we find acceptable 
on november   we completed the public offering of  shares of common stock at a per share price of and received net proceeds of  in  we used the net proceeds to temporarily reduce our borrowings under advance funding facilities rather than invest the proceeds at current short term investment rates that our below our effective cost of borrowing 
in  we increased our advance borrowings in order to make these proceeds available to fund servicing acquisitions 
our primary uses of funds are payments for advances in excess of collections on existing servicing portfolios  payment of interest and operating costs  purchase of msrs and related advances  and repayments of borrowings 
we closely monitor our liquidity position and ongoing funding requirements  and we regularly monitor and project cash flow by period to minimize liquidity risk 
in assessing our liquidity outlook  our primary focus is on three measures requirements for maturing liabilities compared to dollars generated from maturing assets and operating cash flow  the change in advances and match funded advances compared to the change in match funded liabilities and unused borrowing capacity 
at december    of our total maximum borrowing capacity remained unused 
we maintain unused borrowing capacity for three reasons as a protection should advances increase due to increased delinquencies  as a protection should we be unable to either renew existing facilities or obtain new facilities  and to provide capacity for the acquisition of additional msrs 
outlook 
as also noted in the overview liquidity summary in order to reduce fees charged by lenders which we recognize as interest expense  we maintain unused borrowing capacity at a level that we consider prudent relative to the current levels of advances and to meet our funding needs for reasonably foreseeable changes in advances 
we also monitor the duration of our funding sources 
with the increase in the term of our funding sources  we have better matched the duration of our advances and corresponding borrowings and further reduced the relative cost of up front facility fees and expenses 
our  of three year term notes under our homeq facility   two year note under our litton facility and  of two year notes under a third facility account for of our outstanding advance financing at december  debt financing summary 
during  we issued  of notes on september  in connection with the financing of advances that we acquired as part of the litton acquisition  increased the maximum borrowing capacity of a variable funding note from  to  and extended the amortization to december beginning june   maximum borrowing capacity under this note will be reduced to the extent that the lender s commitment under any other advance facilities of ocwen or its affiliates exceeds extended the amortization date of a second facility from june to july  reduced the maximum borrowing capacity from  to  and reduced the annual facility fee from of the maximum borrowing capacity to  terminated an underutilized advance financing facility with a maximum borrowing capacity of  and repaid the outstanding balance on june   repaid  of the homeq advance facility term notes  repaid the remaining  balance of the  senior secured term loan  including  of voluntary repayments  entered into a new  senior secured term loan on september  that was issued with a discount of  and used the proceeds to fund a portion of the litton acquisition 
we repaid  of this loan in  and repaid the remaining  balance of the fee reimbursement advance borrowing 
maximum borrowing capacity for match funded advances increased by  from  at december  to  at december  this increase is primarily a result of the new litton advance financing facility and the increase in capacity of an existing facility by  these increases were offset by the advance receivable backed note series note entering its amortization period  the pay down on the term notes issued in connection with the homeq acquisition which reduces potential borrowing on those notes  the reduction in maximum borrowing capacity on one facility from  to  and the termination of another facility that had a maximum borrowing capacity of  the remaining  balance of the series note was repaid on february  our unused advance borrowing capacity increased from  at december  to  at december  the increases related to the litton advance funding facility and the upsizing of an existing facility were partly offset by the decline in capacity resulting from the pay down of the series note  a reduction in maximum borrowing capacity on one facility and the termination of another facility 
our ability to finance servicing advances is a significant factor that affects our liquidity 
three of our match funded advance facilities are subject to increases in the financing discount if deemed necessary by the rating agencies in order to maintain the minimum rating required for the facility 
while fitch has placed the notes under our advance receivable backed note series on negative watch  we do not expect future advance rate changes to have a material effect on our liquidity 
our ability to continue to pledge collateral under each advance facility depends on the performance of the collateral 
currently  the large majority of our collateral qualifies for financing under the advance facility to which it is pledged 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and under the servicing discussion in the business operating segments section  recent inquiries into servicer foreclosure processes could result in actions by state or federal governmental bodies  regulators or the courts that could result in a further extension of foreclosure timelines 
while the effect of such extensions could be an increase in advances  the effect on liquidity will be lessened if ocwen maintains its ability to utilize spare capacity on its advance facilities because approximately of the increase in advances could be borrowed 
furthermore  if foreclosure moratoria are issued in a manner that brings into question the timely recovery of advances on foreclosed properties  ocwen may no longer be obligated to make further advances and may be able to recover existing advances in certain securitizations from pool level collections which could mitigate any advance increase 
the effects of the extension of foreclosure timelines have  thus far  been more than offset by the effects of increases in other forms of resolution  and advances have continued to decline 
absent significant changes in the foreclosure process  we expect advances to continue to decline 
some of our existing debt covenants limit our ability to incur additional debt in relation to our equity  require that we do not exceed maximum levels of delinquent loans and require that we maintain minimum levels of liquid assets and earnings 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in restrictions on new borrowings or the early termination of our borrowing facilities 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with these covenants and do not expect them to restrict our activities 
by the end of the second quarter of  through voluntary repayments in addition to mandatory quarterly installments of  we had repaid in full our borrowings under the  senior secured term loan that we had entered into on july  in connection with the homeq acquisition 
we made the prepayments in order to absorb excess liquidity and to reduce interest costs 
subsequent to our repayment of the  senior secured term loan  we entered into an agreement for a new  senior secured term loan agreement to finance the litton acquisition that has similar covenants 
cash flows for the year ended december  our operating activities provided  of cash primarily due to collections of servicing advances primarily on the homeq servicing portfolio and net income adjusted for amortization and other non cash items 
excluding  paid to acquire advances in connection with the litton acquisition  collections of servicing advances were  the cash provided by advance collections and earnings were partly offset by the payment of settled litigation and the funding of a new debt service account related to the advance facility established to finance the advances acquired as part of the litton acquisition 
the funding of the new interest earning debt service account was offset in part by lower balance requirements for debt service accounts related to the homeq and other match funded facilities as a result of repayments of the borrowings 
operating cash flows were used principally to repay borrowings under advance financing facilities and the senior secured term loans 
our investing activities used  of cash during on september   we paid  to acquire litton  including advances of  and msrs of  we also invested  in correspondent one 
distributions received from our asset management entities were  during our financing activities provided  of cash consisting primarily of  received from the new match funded facility established to finance the advances acquired in the litton acquisition 
we also received proceeds of  from the issuance of the  senior secured term loan 
we used the proceeds from these two new facilities to fund the litton acquisition 
cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds of  from the issuance of  common stock allowed us to make net repayments of  against match funded liabilities 
in addition  we were able to repay the  remaining balance of the  senior secured term loan and payments of  on the new  senior secured term loan 
we also repaid the remaining balance on our fee reimbursement advance 
in connection with the issuance of the new senior secured term loan  we paid  of debt issuance costs to the lender 
cash flows for the year ended december  our operating activities provided  of cash primarily due to our liquidation of auction rate securities and net collections of servicing advances

during  we also received proceeds of  from the sale of our general partnership interests in three affordable housing properties and received  of distributions from our asset management entities 
our financing activities provided  of cash primarily consisting of  of net proceeds from match funded liabilities of our servicing business including  received in connection with the notes issued to finance the advances acquired as part of the homeq acquisition 
we also received proceeds of  from the issuance of a senior secured term loan 
this was partially offset by our repayment of the investment line of  repayment of  of principal and  of debt issue costs on the senior secured term loan and repurchase of our capital securities with a face value of  for  we also paid the first annual installment of  on our  fee reimbursement advance 
cash flows for the year ended december  our operating activities generated  of cash primarily due to lower investment in trading activities  declining delinquencies and lower collections 
trading activities provided  of cash from redemptions of auction rate securities at par 
our investing activities used  cash primarily due to purchases of msrs offset by lower distributions received from asset management vehicles and reduced proceeds from sales of real estate 
our financing activities used  cash as we made net repayments of  on match funded liabilities  other secured borrowings and the investment line  repurchased debt securities for  and distributed  of cash in connection with the separation  offset in part by  of net proceeds from the issuance and repurchase of common stock

involvement with spes 
we use spes for a variety of purposes but principally in the financing of our servicing advances and in the securitization of mortgage loans 
our securitizations of mortgage loans were structured as sales 
the spes to which we transferred the mortgage loans were qspes and  therefore under previous accounting rules  were not subject to consolidation through we have retained both subordinated and residual interests in these spes 
effective january   the accounting standards were amended to eliminate the concept of a qspe 
we reevaluated these qspes as well as all other potentially significant interests in other unconsolidated entities to determine if we should include them in our consolidated financial statements 
we determined that four of these loan securitization trusts are vies and that we are the primary beneficiary 
we have included these four trusts in our consolidated financial statements effective january  we generally use match funded securitization facilities to finance our servicing advances 
the spes to which the advances are transferred in the securitization transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements either because we have the majority equity interest in the spe or because we are the primary beneficiary where the spe is a vie 
the holders of the debt of these spes can look only to the assets of the spes for satisfaction of the debt and have no recourse against ocn 
however  ols has guaranteed the payment of the obligations of the issuer under one of our match funded facilities 
the maximum amount payable under the guarantee is limited to of the notes outstanding at the end of the facility s revolving period on july vies 
in addition to certain of our financing spes  we have invested in several other vies primarily in connection with purchases of whole loans 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we report the vie in our consolidated financial statements

repurchase agreements are accounted for as secured financings if the transferee has not surrendered control over the transferred assets 
the amendments in this asu remove from the assessment of effective control the criterion relating to the transferor s ability to repurchase or redeem financial assets on substantially the agreed terms  even in the event of default by the transferee 
the amendments in this asu also eliminate the requirement to demonstrate that the transferor possesses adequate collateral to fund substantially all the cost of purchasing replacement financial assets

asu asc  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
the amendments in this asu explain how to measure fair value 
they do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting
