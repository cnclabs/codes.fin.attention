we provide natural gas solutions for vehicle fleets primarily in the us and canada 
our primary business activity is selling cng and lng vehicle fuel to our customers 
we also manufacture and service advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment  build  operate and maintain fueling stations  sell or lease fueling stations to our customers  process and sell rng  and provide natural gas vehicle conversions 
our customers include fleet operators in a variety of markets  such as trucking  airports  taxis  refuse hauling and public transit 
in april  we opened our first cng station in lima  peru  through our joint venture  clean energy del peru 
in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dce 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells rng at the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
on october   we completed our acquisition of baf  a company that provides natural gas conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development for natural gas vehicles 
on september   we completed the purchase of imw  a company that manufactures and services advanced  non lubricated natural gas fueling compressor and related equipment 
on december   we acquired northstar  a provider of design  engineering  construction and maintenance services for lng and lcng fueling stations 
overview this overview discusses matters on which our management primarily focuses in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
sources of revenue 
we generate the vast majority of our revenue from selling cng and lng  and commencing on september   also from selling advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment and maintenance services through our subsidiary  imw 
a significant portion of our revenue is also earned by designing and constructing and selling natural gas fueling stations  selling natural gas vehicle conversions through our wholly owned subsidiary  baf  providing fueling station operations and maintenance services to our customers  and selling pipeline quality rng produced by our dce joint venture 
we also generate limited revenue by providing the financing for our customers natural gas vehicle purchases 
key operating data 
in evaluating our operating performance  our management focuses primarily on the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents delivered which we define as i the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents we sell to our customers  plus ii the volume of gasoline gallon equivalents dispensed to our customers at stations where we provide o m services  but do not sell the cng or lng  plus iii our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents sold as cng by our joint venture in peru  plus iv our proportionate share of the gasoline gallon equivalents of rng produced and sold as pipeline quality natural gas by dce  our gross margin which we define as revenue minus cost of sales  and net income loss attributable to us 
the following table  which you should read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes contained elsewhere in this form k  presents our key operating data for the years ended december    and gasoline gallon equivalents delivered year ended december  in millions cng rng lng total operating data gross margin net loss key trends in  and according to the eia  demand for natural gas fuels in the united states increased by approximately during the period january  through december  we believe this growth in demand was attributable primarily to the rising prices of gasoline and diesel relative to cng and lng during these periods and increasingly stringent environmental regulations affecting vehicle fleets 
the number of fueling stations we served grew during the past three years from at december  to at december  a increase 
included in this number are all of the cng and lng fueling stations we own  maintain or with which we have a fueling supply contract 
the amount of cng and lng gasoline gallon equivalents we delivered from to increased by 
the increase in gasoline gallon equivalents delivered was the primary contributor to increased revenues during  and in addition  in  we also benefitted from increased revenues from compressor sales and fueling station installations as a result of our acquisitions of imw and northstar  which occurred during the fourth quarter of our cost of sales also increased during these periods  which was attributable primarily to increased costs related to delivering more cng and lng to our customers in and in  the cost of sales related to compressors sold through imw and fueling station installations performed by northstar also contributed to the increase 
since the last half of  we have experienced reduced margins in certain markets  particularly in the municipal transit and refuse sector 
the reduction in margins is primarily a result of increased competition and sales agreements with larger entities that have greater pricing leverage 
also  in many cases  our agreements with our customers  including governmental agencies  are subject to a competitive bidding process and we have been required to reduce our prices to maintain our contracts as they come up for bid 
in addition  in may and june of  we acquired four compressed natural gas operations and maintenance services contracts with municipal transit agencies  and in and  we won several contracts with a transit agency in california that have significant volume but smaller margins than we typically generate on our fuel sales 
as a result of all of these factors  the overall average margin on our fuel sales across our business decreased sequentially in and we believe that our margins on fuel sales will improve in the future to the extent we are successful in increasing our retail cng and lng fueling operations  which is where we earn our highest margins 
if our retail cng and lng fueling operations do not grow  we may experience further reduced margins 
we may also lose contracts with governmental customers if we are unwilling or unable to reduce our prices or lose in the competitive bidding process  which would reduce our volumes 
we will need to increase our business with non government entities to replace volumes lost in competitive bid procurements when we are not successful in retaining the contracts 
during  prices for oil  gasoline  and diesel fuel generally increased  while the price for natural gas generally decreased 
oil hit a high of in april and settled at per barrel on december  in california  average retail prices for gasoline have increased from per gallon in january to per gallon at december   and average retail prices for diesel fuel have increased from per diesel gallon in january to per diesel gallon at december  higher gasoline and diesel prices improve our margins on fuel sales to the extent we price our fuel at a discount to gasoline or diesel and natural gas prices do not increase by a corresponding amount 
during this time period  the price for natural gas generally declined 
the nymex price for natural gas ranged from per mmbtu in january to per mmbtu in december the average retail sales price of our cng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area ranged from for the month of january to for the month of december the average retail sales price of our lng fuel sold in the los angeles metropolitan area ranged from during january to for the month of december recent developments 
in december  we issued to mr 
boone pickens  one of our founders and a member of our board of directors  a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the warrant had an exercise price per share of and expired at pm pacific time on december   or the expiration time 
the warrant was issued to mr 
pickens prior to our initial public offering in exchange for the cancellation of all amounts we owed to him under a revolving line of credit entered into in  which we used for margin deposits related to futures contracts 
also  in exchange for issuance of the warrant  mr 
pickens assumed all of our then outstanding liabilities related to certain futures contracts 
the warrant was transferrable with our consent 
prior to the expiration time on december  mr 
pickens notified us that he was exercising a portion of the warrant to purchase  shares  mr 
pickens transferred his right  title and interest in the warrant with respect to the remaining  shares to certain third party investors  and we consented to such transfers  in consideration of the warrant transfers  the third party investors granted mr 
pickens options to repurchase an aggregate of  shares for per share through december  for  shares and december  for  shares  the third party investors notified us that they were exercising the transferred portions of the warrant to purchase an aggregate of  shares  mr 
pickens and the third party investors delivered to us an aggregate of  which was the total exercise price for the warrant  and we issued an aggregate of  shares to mr 
pickens and the third party investors 
by may   we intend to exercise our option to acquire the remaining of servo tech engineering  inc servotech  a company that provides design and engineering services for natural gas fueling systems among other services  for million  under an option issued to us when we acquired the initial interest in servotech for million on february  anticipated future trends 
we anticipate that  over the long term  the prices for gasoline and diesel will continue to be signifcantly higher than the price of natural gas as a vehicle fuel  and more stringent emissions requirements will continue to make natural gas vehicles an attractive alternative to traditional gasoline and diesel powered vehicles 
our belief that natural gas will continue  over the long term  to be a cheaper vehicle fuel than gasoline or diesel is based in large part on the growth in us natural gas production 
the annual outlook early release from the eia states that total marketed production of natural gas grew by an estimated bcf d percent in  the largest year over year volumetric increase in history 
this strong growth was driven in large part by increases in shale gas production 
eia expects production to grow by bcf d percent in and bcf d percent in as low natural gas prices reduce new drilling plans and consumption is estimated to grow at a moderate pace 
in the face of continued low spot and future prices  as well as record high storage levels for this time of year  drillers appear to have begun cutting back on new production plans for according to baker hughes  the natural gas rig count has fallen to as of december   from a high of in mid october 
however  high initial production rates from new wells  associated natural gas production from oil drilling  and a backlog of uncompleted or unconnected wells contribute to the forecast of further production increases in and  albeit at lower rates than the preliminary annual energy outlook report from the eia estimates that shale gas could represent tcf of us natural gas production by the year  up from the and tcf of domestic natural gas produced in and  respectively 
the eia estimates that based upon consumption levels  that there is enough available shale gas to satisfy demand for the next years 
the primary reason for the availability of additional natural gas is the increased successful use of recent shale drilling technology and continued drilling in shale plays with high concentrations of natural gas liquids and crude oil  which have a higher energy value than dry natural gas 
hydraulic fracturing commonly called fracking or hydrofracking is a technique in which water  sand and a small amount of chemicals and sand are pumped into the well to unlock the hydrocarbons trapped in shale formations by opening cracks fractures in the rock and allowing natural gas to flow from the shale into the well 
when used in conjunction with horizontal drilling  hydraulic fracturing enables gas producers to extract shale gas at reasonable cost 
horizontal drilling is an enhanced oil recovery eor or gas recovery method 
a horizontal well is commonly defined as any well in which the lower part of the well bore parallels the oil zone 
the benefits of horizontal wells include the avoidance of drawdown related problems such as water gas coning  and extension of wells by means of multiple drain holes 
without these techniques  natural gas does not flow to the well rapidly  and commercial quantities cannot be produced from shale because the natural gas would not flow from the formation at high enough rates to justify the cost of drilling 
based on analyst reports  we believe that there is a significant worldwide supply of natural gas relative to crude oil 
according to the bp statistical review of world energy  on a global basis  the ratio of proven natural gas reserves to natural gas production was greater than the ratio of proven crude oil reserves to crude oil production 
this analysis suggests significantly greater long term availability of natural gas than crude oil based on current consumption 
we believe there will be significant growth in the consumption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel among vehicle fleets  and our goal is to capitalize on this trend and enhance our leadership position as this market expands 
with our recent acquisitions of imw and northstar  we are now a fully integrated provider of advanced compression technology  station building and fueling 
we also anticipate expanding our sales of cng and lng in the other markets in which we operate  including trucking  refuse hauling  airports  taxis and public transit 
consistent with the anticipated growth of our business  we also expect that our operating costs and capital expenditures will increase  primarily from the anticipated expansion of our station network or lng production capacity  as well as the logistics of delivering more cng and lng to our customers 
we also anticipate that we will continue to seek to acquire assets and or businesses that are in the natural gas fueling infrastructure or rng production business that may require us to raise additional capital 
additionally  we have and will continue to increase our sales and marketing team and other necessary personnel as we seek to expand our existing markets and enter new markets  which will also result in increased costs 
we anticipate the commercial roll out of natural gas engines that are well suited for the us heavy duty trucking market  together with the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas fuel  will result in increased adoption of natural gas fueled trucks by the us trucking industry 
heavy duty trucks in the us are generally high volume consumers of vehicle fuel 
we believe many use  gallons or more per year 
we therefore believe that this market may become our largest market 
as a result  we have made a significant commitment of capital and other resources to build a nationwide network of lng truck fueling stations  which we refer to as america s natural gas highway  or angh  on the interstate highway system and in major metropolitan areas that will enable natural gas fueled freight trucking coast to coast and border to border within the continental states 
we expect the first phase of america s natural gas highway to include approximately fueling stations  with approximately stations anticipated to be open in states by the end of  and the balance in we expect that many angh stations will be co located at pilot flying j travel centers already serving goods movement trucking 
many governmental entities  which represented approximately of our revenues from through  are experiencing significant budget deficits as a result of the economic recession and have been  and may continue to be  unable to invest in new natural gas vehicles for their transit or refuse fleets 
they may also be compelled to reduce public transportation and services  or the prices they pay for these services  which would negatively affect our business 
sources of liquidity and anticipated capital expenditures 
liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through operating cash flows  the sale or maturity of existing assets  or by the acquisition of additional funds through capital management 
historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
our business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations  including america s natural gas highway stations  expanding our lng plant  expanding and building landfill gas processing plants  and the purchase of lng trailers 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries  including rng production 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend on our rate of new station construction and potential merger or acquisition activity 
for more information  see liquidity and capital resources below 
we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and may reduce our ability to grow our business and generate increased revenues 
business risks and uncertainties 
our business and prospects are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties 
for more information  see risk factors in part i  item a 
operations we generate revenues principally by selling cng and lng and providing o m services to our vehicle fleet customers 
for the year ended december   cng and rng together represented and lng represented of our natural gas sales on a gasoline gallon equivalent basis 
to a lesser extent  we generate revenues by designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing those stations to our customers 
we also generate significant revenues through sales of rng produced by our joint venture subsidiary dce  sales of natural gas vehicles by our wholly owned subsidiary baf  sales of advanced natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment and maintenance services through imw  and sales of lng and lcng fueling station design  construction and o m services through northstar 
substantially all of our operating and maintenance revenues are generated from cng stations  as owners of lng stations typically tend to operate and maintain their own stations 
substantially all of our station sale and leasing revenues have been generated from cng stations 
cng sales we sell cng through fueling stations located on our customers properties and through our network of public access fueling stations 
at these cng fueling stations  we procure natural gas from local utilities or brokers under standard  floating rate arrangements and then compress and dispense it into our customers vehicles 
our cng sales are made primarily through contracts with our fleet customers 
under these contracts  pricing is determined primarily on an index plus basis  which is calculated by adding a margin to the local index or utility price for natural gas 
cng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we also sell a small amount of cng under fixed price contracts 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts  as appropriate  and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy 
our fleet customers typically are billed monthly based on the volume of cng sold at a station 
the remainder of our cng sales are on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
lng sales we sell lng to fleet customers  who typically own and operate their fueling stations 
increasingly  we also sell lng to fleet and other customers at our public access lng stations and for non vehicle use  such as power generation 
during  we procured of our lng from third party producers  and we produced the remainder of the lng at our liquefaction plants in texas and california 
for lng that we purchase from third parties  we may enter into take or pay contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based rates 
we deliver lng via our fleet of tanker trailers to fueling stations  where it is stored and dispensed in liquid form into vehicles 
we sell lng principally through supply contracts that are priced on either a fixed price or index plus basis 
lng sales revenues based on an index plus methodology increase or decrease as a result of an increase or decrease in the price of natural gas 
we will continue to offer fixed price contracts as appropriate and consistent with our natural gas hedging policy adopted in may our lng contracts provide that we charge our customers periodically based on the volume of lng supplied 
we also sell lng on a per fill up basis at prices we set at the pump based on prevailing market conditions 
these customers typically pay using a credit card at the station 
government incentives from october  through december   we received a federal fuel tax credit vetc of per gasoline gallon equivalent of cng and per liquid gallon of lng that we sold as vehicle fuel 
based on the service relationship with our customers  either we or our customers were able to claim the credit 
we recorded these tax credits as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations as the credits are fully refundable and do not need to offset tax liabilities to be received 
as such  the credits are not deemed income tax credits under the accounting guidance applicable to income taxes 
in addition  we believe the credits are properly recorded as revenue because we often incorporate the tax credits into our pricing with our customers  thereby lowering the actual price per gallon we charge them 
the program providing for the vetc expired on december  operation and maintenance we generate a portion of our revenue from operation and maintenance agreements for cng and lng fueling stations where we do not supply the fuel 
we refer to this portion of our business as o m 
at these fueling stations  the customer contracts directly with a local broker or utility to purchase natural gas 
for o m services  we do not sell the fuel itself  but generally charge a per gallon fee based on the volume of fuel dispensed at the station 
we include the volume of fuel dispensed at the stations at which we provide o m services in our calculation of aggregate gasoline gallon equivalents delivered 
station construction we generate a portion of our revenue from designing and constructing fueling stations and selling or leasing the stations to our customers 
for these projects  we act as general contractor or supervise qualified third party contractors 
we charge construction fees or lease rates based on the size and complexity of the project 
on december   we completed the purchase of northstar  an entity that provides design  engineering  construction and maintenance services for lng and lcng fueling stations 
during  northstar contributed approximately million to our revenue 
vehicle acquisition and finance in  we commenced offering vehicle finance services for some of our customers purchases of natural gas vehicles or the conversion of their existing gasoline or diesel powered vehicles to operate on natural gas 
we loan to certain qualifying customers a portion of  and on occasion up to of  the purchase price of their natural gas vehicles 
we may also lease vehicles in the future 
where appropriate  we apply for and receive state and federal incentives associated with natural gas vehicle purchases and pass these benefits through to our customers 
we may also secure vehicles to place with customers or pay deposits with respect to such vehicles prior to receiving a firm order from our customers  which we may be required to purchase if our customer fails to purchase the vehicle as anticipated 
through december   we have not generated significant revenue from vehicle financing activities 
landfill gas in august  we acquired of the outstanding membership interests of dce for a purchase price of million  including transaction costs 
dce owns a facility that collects  processes and sells rng from the mccommas bluff landfill located in dallas  texas 
for the years ended december    and  dce generated approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in revenue from sales of rng  all of which is included in our consolidated statements of operations 
on april   dce entered into a fifteen year gas sale agreement with shell energy north america us  lp  or shell  for the sale by dce to shell of rng produced by dce s landfill gas processing facility 
dce retains the right to reserve from the gas sale agreement up to mmbtus per day of rng for sale as a vehicle fuel 
to the extent that dce produces volumes of rng in excess of the volumes sold under the agreement with shell  dce will either attempt to sell such volumes at then prevailing market prices or seek to enter into another gas sale agreement in the future 
dce may not produce or be able to sell up to the maximum volumes called for under the agreement 
dce s ability to produce rng is dependent on a number of factors beyond dce s control including  but not limited to  the availability and composition of the landfill gas that is collected  the operation of the landfill by the city of dallas and the reliability of the processing plant s critical equipment 
the processing equipment is currently being expanded and upgraded  which may result in significant down time to complete the work  which consequently may reduce dce s sales of rng during the expansion and upgrade period 
the expansion and upgrade work is anticipated to continue through the first half of the sale price for the gas under the agreement with shell is fixed 
the sale price for the gas represents a substantial premium to the current prevailing prices for natural gas at march  the gas sale agreement is terminable by either party on thirty days written notice if the california energy commission makes a written determination or adopts a ruling or regulation after the date of the agreement that the rng sold under the agreement will  from the date of such ruling or regulation  no longer qualify as a california renewable portfolio standard eligible fuel 
in addition  shell has the right to terminate the agreement upon thirty days written notice if the volumes of rng produced and delivered  calculated monthly on a rolling two year average  are less than an annual average of  mmbtu per year or  mmbtu per day 
in november  our subsidiary canton renewables  llc canton renewables  signed a gas sale and purchase agreement that grants canton renewables the right to produce rng at a landfill owned and operated by republic services in canton  michigan 
the landfill gas facility is under construction and is expected to be completed and operational in the summer of canton renewables has executed an agreement with an affiliate of the local gas utility that will enable canton renewables to inject the rng produced into the local gas transmission system and transport it to the interstate pipeline  where it may be distributed for use in power generation or as a low carbon  renewable vehicle fuel 
we have entered into a ten year fixed price sale contract for the majority of the rng we expect this landfill gas facility to produce 
vehicle conversions on october   we completed our acquisition of baf 
founded in  baf provides natural gas vehicle conversions  alternative fuel systems  application engineering  service and warranty support and research and development 
baf s vehicle conversions include taxis  vans  pick up trucks and shuttle buses 
baf utilizes advanced natural gas system integration technology and has certified ngvs under both epa and carb standards achieving super ultra low emission vehicle emissions 
we generate revenues through the sale of natural gas vehicles that have been converted to run on natural gas by baf 
the majority of baf s revenue during and was derived from sales of converted natural gas service vans to at t 
for the years ended december  and  baf contributed approximately million  and million  respectively  to our revenue 
natural gas fueling compressors on september   we completed our purchase of imw 
imw manufactures and services advanced  non lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment for the global natural gas fueling market 
imw is headquartered near vancouver  british columbia  has other manufacturing facilities near shanghai  china  and in ferndale  washington  and has sales and service offices in bangladesh  colombia  peru and the united states 
during  imw contributed approximately million to our revenue 
volatility of earnings and cash flows during   and  our futures contracts qualified for hedge accounting  so we had no derivative gains or losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and in accordance with our natural gas hedging policy  we plan to structure all futures contracts as cash flow hedges under the applicable derivative accounting guidance  but we cannot be certain that they will qualify 
see risk management activities below 
if the futures contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting  we could incur significant increases or decreases in our earnings based on fluctuations in the market value of the contracts from period to period 
additionally  we are required to maintain a margin account to cover losses related to our natural gas futures contracts 
futures contracts are valued daily  and if our contracts are in loss positions at the end of a trading day  our broker will transfer the amount of the losses from our margin account to a clearinghouse 
if at any time the funds in our margin account drop below a specified maintenance level  our broker will issue a margin call that requires us to restore the balance 
consequently  these payments could significantly impact our cash balances 
at december   we had million of margin deposits  which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and notes receivable and other long term assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
the decrease in the value of our futures positions and any corresponding margin deposits required thereon could significantly impact our financial position in the future 
volatility of earnings related to series i warrants beginning january   under financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance  we are required to record the change in the fair market value of our series i warrants in our consolidated financial statements 
we have recognized a gain of million and million related to recording the estimated fair market value changes of our series i warrants in the years ended december  and december   respectively 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere herein 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially affected by future gains or losses we are required to recognize as a result of valuing our series i warrants 
on november    of the series i warrants were exercised and thus  were not outstanding during volatility of earnings related to contingent consideration under recent business combination accounting guidance  we are required to record the change in the value of the contingent consideration related to our acquisitions of both baf and imw in our financial statements through the contingency period  which expired december  for baf and expires on march  for imw 
if the anticipated results of imw increase or decrease during future periods  we may be required to recognize material losses or gains based on the valuation of the increased or decreased consideration due to the former imw shareholder 
during  we recognized a gain of million related to the estimated change in value of the baf and imw contingent consideration  of which million related to baf 
our earnings or loss per share may be materially affected by future gains or losses we are required to recognize as a result of changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration amount 
debt compliance in connection with our acquisition of imw  we entered into a credit agreement with hsbc that requires imw to comply with certain financial covenants 
among those financial covenants are that imw shall not permit i its ratio of debt to tangible net worth to be greater than to until december  and greater than to on and after january   ii its tangible net worth to  at anytime  be below cad million and iii its ratio of current assets to current liabilities to be less than to until december  and less than to on and after january  should imw s operating results not materialize as planned  we could violate these covenants 
if we were to violate a covenant  we would seek a waiver from the bank  which the bank is not obligated to grant 
if the bank does not grant a waiver  all of the obligations under the credit agreement would be due and payable 
imw was in compliance with these covenants as of december  the indenture and the loan agreement dcemb entered into as part of issuing its revenue bonds  as defined and disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  have certain non financial debt covenants with which dcemb must comply 
as of december   dcemb was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the loan agreement we entered into as part of issuing the chk notes  as defined and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  has certain non financial debt covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with these debt covenants 
the convertible note purchase agreements we entered into as part of issuing the slg notes  as defined and discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  have certain non financial debt covenants with which we must comply 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
some of our natural gas fuel sales contracts require us to sell lng or cng to our customers at a fixed price 
these contracts expose us to the risk that the price of natural gas may increase above the natural gas cost component included in the price at which we are committed to sell gas to our customers 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility of our earnings related to our futures contracts and to reduce our risk related to fixed price sales contracts  we operate under a natural gas hedging policy pursuant to which we only purchase futures contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular fixed price contract or bid 
subject to the conditions set forth in the policy  we purchase futures contracts in quantities reasonably expected to hedge effectively our exposure to cash flow variability related to such fixed price sales contracts entered into after the date of the policy 
unless otherwise agreed in advance by the board of directors and the derivative committee  we will conduct our futures activities and enter into fixed price sales contracts only in accordance with the natural gas hedging policy  a complete copy of which  as amended effective may   was filed as exhibit to our form k filed with the sec on june  the summary of the policy described above does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the copy of the policy previously filed 
due to the restrictions of our revised hedging policy  we expect to offer fewer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
if we do offer a fixed price sales contract  we anticipate including a price component that would cover our estimated cash requirements over the duration of the underlying futures contracts 
the amount of this price component will vary based on the anticipated volume and the natural gas price component to be covered under the fixed price sales contracts 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  asset realization  accounts receivable reserves  notes receivable reserves  warranty reserves  derivative values  income taxes  and the fair value of equity instruments granted as stock based compensation 
we use historical experience  market quotes  and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets before  we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and between annual evaluations if events occured or circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the goodwill below its carrying amount 
beginning in  we performed our evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill under the amended guidance issued by the fasb in accounting standards update asu  testing for goodwill impairment  issued in september  which we chose to early adopt 
under the amended requirements of asu  an entity is not required to quantitatively determine a reporting unit s fair value if it concludes  based upon a qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit s fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance also allows us to proceed directly to a quantitative analysis on an individual reporting unit basis  which we do when there is doubt about whether or not a qualitative assessment is sufficient or when there is an indicator of impairment 
based on our analysis  which we performed as of october   no impairment was identified 
we test tangible and intangible long lived assets with definite useful lives for impairment whenever circumstances or events may affect the recoverability of the long lived assets 
the evaluation is primarily dependent on the estimated future cash flows of the assets and the fair value of these items  as determined by management based on a number of estimates  including future cash flow projections  discount rates and terminal values 
in determining these estimates  management considers internally generated information and information obtained from discussions with market participants 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
the impairment test for long lived assets is a two step process 
the first step is to assess if events or changes in circumstances have affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
if management believes that recoverability has been affected  then step two requires management to calculate the undiscounted future cash flow related to the asset or asset group and to compare the cash flow to the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying value  then there is no impairment 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to an operating and maintenance contract we lost in a competitive bid to a competitor 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  our subsidiary  dce  expensed approximately million of costs related to equipment that was replaced as part of its expansion of the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
we had no impairment charges during warranty reserves our warranty periods range up to thirty six months  depending on the product or service 
we provide a warranty reserve for estimated product warranty costs at the time the applicable sale is recognized 
we continuously monitor and analyze warranty claims and maintain a reserve for the related warranty costs based on historical experience and assumptions 
if actual failure rates and the resulting cost of repair vary from our historically based estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty reserve would be required 
natural gas derivative activities fasb authoritative guidance for our derivative instruments  specifically for our natural gas futures contracts  requires the recognition of all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
for those contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives directly to our consolidated statements of operations 
for those contracts that do qualify for hedge accounting  we record the changes in the fair value in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of stockholders equity 
we determine the fair value of our derivatives at the end of each reporting period based on quoted market prices from the nymex discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts related to future periods 
the counter party to our derivative transactions is a high credit quality counterparty  however  we are subject to counterparty credit risk to the extent the counterparty is unable to meet its settlement commitments 
we manage this credit risk by minimizing the number and size of our derivative contracts and by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
we record valuation adjustments against the derivative assets to reflect counterparty risk  if necessary 
the counterparty is also exposed to credit risk by us  which requires us to provide cash deposits as collateral when our contracts are in a liability position in the aggregate 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our cng and lng gas sales and for our o m services in accordance with us gaap  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title and the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
applying these factors  we typically recognize revenue from the sale of natural gas at the time fuel is dispensed or  in the case of lng sales agreements  delivered to our customers storage facilities 
we recognize revenue from o m agreements as we provide the related services 
in certain transactions with our customers  we agree to provide multiple products or services  including construction of and sale of a station  providing o m to the station  and sale of fuel to the customer 
we evaluate the separability of revenues based on current fasb authoritative guidance  which provides a framework for establishing whether or not a particular arrangement with a customer has one or more revenue elements 
prior to  to the extent we had adequate objective evidence of the values of the separate elements indentified as part of a contract  we allocated the revenue from the contract on a relative fair value basis at the inception of the arrangement 
during and  we did not have objective evidence for our multi element arrangements  which generally resulted in the deferral of revenue until the future services are performed 
since  however  we have applied newly issued fasb authoritative guidance that allows us to use a combination of objective and reliable evidence to develop management s best estimate of the fair value of the undelivered element 
if the arrangement contains a lease  we use the existing evidence of fair value to separate the lease from the other elements in the arrangement 
we recognize revenue related to our leasing activities in accordance with current fasb authoritative guidance 
our existing station leases are sales type leases  giving rise to profit at the delivery of the leased station 
unearned revenue is amortized into income over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 
for those arrangements  we recognize gas sales and o m service revenues as earned from the customer on a volume delivered basis 
we typically recognize revenue on long term fueling station construction projects where we sell the station to the customer using the completed contract method 
however  for imw and northstar  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in those circumstances  revenue is recognized as work on a contract progresses  based on cost incurred in relation to total estimated costs to be incurred for that project 
we recognize revenue on rng sales and vehicle sales when we transfer title of the gas or vehicle to our customer 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees based on the grant date fair value 
our assessment of the estimated fair value of the stock options granted is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables and the related tax impact 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model also requires the input of certain assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock price  expected dividends  if any  expected life of the stock option  and the risk free interest rate appropriate for the expected holding period 
income taxes we compute income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
the impact on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates and laws  if any  are applied to the years during which temporary differences are expected to be settled and are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period of enactment 
we record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets when management determines it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized 
when evaluating the need for a valuation analysis  we use estimates involving a high degree of judgment including projected future income and the amounts and estimated timing of the reversal of any deferred tax liabilities 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been given to such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated

seasonality and inflation to some extent  we experience seasonality in our results of operations 
natural gas vehicle fuel amounts consumed by some of our customers tends to be higher in summer months when buses and other fleet vehicles use more fuel to power their air conditioning systems 
natural gas commodity prices tend to be higher in the fall and winter months due to increased overall demand for natural gas for heating during these periods 
since our inception  inflation has not significantly affected our operating results 
however  costs for construction  repairs  maintenance  electricity and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures and could affect our ability to maintain our stations adequately  build new stations  build new lng plants and expand our existing facilities or materially increase our operating costs 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal sources of liquidity have consisted of cash provided by operations and financing activities 
in march  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of tax exempt revenue bonds by our dcemb subsidiary 
we received aggregate net proceeds of million from the issuance of convertible notes in july and august  and we have commitments from an investor for an additional million in convertible debt securities over the subsequent two years 
also  in december  we received aggregate net proceeds of million from the exercise of warrants by mr 
boone pickens and certain third party investors 
our million line of credit expired august   as we did not elect the one year renewal option 
we paid off our facility b loan during  which had a balance of million at the time of repayment 
in addition to funding operations  our principal uses of cash have been  and are expected to be  the construction of new fueling stations  including america s natural gas highway stations  construction of lng production facilities  the purchase of new lng tanker trailers  investment in rng production facilities  mergers and acquisitions  the financing of natural gas vehicles for our customers and general corporate purposes  including making deposits to support our derivative activities  geographic expansion domestically and internationally  expanding our sales and marketing activities  support of legislative initiatives and for working capital for our expansion 
we have also acquired and may continue to seek to acquire and invest in companies or assets in the natural gas and rng fueling infrastructure  services and production industries 
on february  the closing date  we paid million to acquire a equity interest in servotech engineering  inc servotech  a company that provides design and engineering services for natural gas fueling systems among other services 
we intend to exercise our option to purchase the remaining of servotech for million by may we financed our operations in primarily through cash on hand and cash provided by financing activities 
at december   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  cash used in operating activities was million for  compared to million used in our operating cash flow  before working capital changes  decreased by million between periods  primarily related to increased selling  general and administrative expenses in as we increased our headcount from at december  to  at december  and we incurred increased expenses due to our growth during the year 
our working capital changes resulted in an increase in cash flow between periods due to timing differences related to various cash flows between periods 
the biggest change between periods resulted from our collection of a full year of vetc revenue million in as the legislation for vetc was reinstated in the fourth quarter of and made retroactive to january   but not filed for and received until cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million for our purchases of property and equipment were million during  compared to million in in  we increased our capital expenditures on our fueling stations and our rng landfill facilities 
our investment in unconsolidated affiliates totaled million in  and was primarily related to increased investments in the vehicle production group  llc  a company producing a cng taxi and paratransit vehicle 
we also invested million in to purchase a interest in servotech engineering  inc  a company that provides design and engineering services for natural gas fueling systems 
in  we paid million related to our acquisitions of imw and northstar 
in  we paid million for our acquisition of weaver electric  inc in  we transferred million to restricted cash accounts related to funds earmarked for station construction along america s natural gas highway and funds designated for the plant expansion at our mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
we also purchased million of short term investments in in connection with our cash management policy 
cash provided by financing activities for was million  compared to million for in we received million from convertible notes we issued  before incurring million of debt issuance costs  million from certain warrants that were exercised  and million related to stock options exercised 
our dcemb subsidiary also raised million in a revenue bond financing during in  we received net proceeds of million related to the exercise of  series i warrants and net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
in  we also paid million in association with the contingent consideration obligations on our imw and baf acquisitions 
our financial position and liquidity are  and will be  influenced by a variety of factors  including our ability to generate cash flows from operations  deposits and margin calls on our futures positions  the level of any outstanding indebtedness and the interest we are obligated to pay on this indebtedness  our capital expenditure requirements which consist primarily of station construction  lng plant construction costs  rng plant construction costs and the purchase of lng tanker trailers and equipment and any merger or acquisition activity 
capital expenditures our business plan calls for approximately million in capital expenditures in  primarily related to construction of new fueling stations  including stations along angh  expanding our california lng plant  expansion and construction of landfill gas processing plants  and the purchase of lng trailers 
we may also elect to invest additional amounts in companies or assets in the natural gas fueling infrastructure  services and production industries  including rng production 
we will need to raise additional capital as necessary to fund any capital expenditures or investments that we cannot fund through available cash or cash generated by operations 
the timing and necessity of any future capital raise will depend on our rate of new station construction and potential merger or acquisition activity 
we may not be able to raise capital on terms that are favorable to existing stockholders or at all 
any inability to raise capital may impair our ability to invest in new stations  develop natural gas fueling infrastructure and invest in strategic transactions or acquisitions and may reduce the ability of our business to grow and generate increased revenues 
contractual obligations the following represents the scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt and capital lease obligations a operating lease commitments b take or pay lng purchase contracts c construction contracts d dcemb electricity contract e total a consists of long term debt and capital lease obligations to finance acquisitions and equipment purchases  including interest

d consists of our obligations to fund various fueling station construction projects  net of amounts funded through december   and excluding contractual commitments related to station sales contracts 
e consists of our obligations to purchase electricity at our rng plant at the mccommas bluff landfill in dallas  texas 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had the following off balance sheet arrangements that had  or are reasonably likely to have  a material effect on our financial condition 
outstanding surety bonds for construction contracts and general corporate purposes totaling million  two take or pay contracts for the purchase of lng  operating leases where we are the lessee  operating leases where we are the lessor and owner of the equipment  and firm commitments to sell cng and lng at fixed prices 
we provide surety bonds primarily for construction contracts in the ordinary course of business  as a form of guarantee 
no liability has been recorded in connection with our surety bonds as we do not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these arrangements for which we will not be reimbursed 
we have two contracts that require us to purchase minimum volumes of lng at index based prices 
one contract expires in june and the other contract expires in october we have entered into operating lease arrangements for certain equipment and for our office and field operating locations in the ordinary course of business 
the terms of our leases expire at various dates through additionally  in november  we entered into a ground lease for acres in california on which we built our california lng liquefaction plant 
the lease is for an initial term of thirty years and requires payments of  per year  plus up to  per year for each million gallons of production capacity utilized  subject to future adjustment based on consumer price index changes 
we must also pay a royalty to the landlord for each gallon of lng produced at the facility  as well as a fee for certain other services that the landlord will provide 
commercial operations began december   and the fixed payments for this lease are included in operating lease commitments in the contractual obligations table set forth above 
we are also the lessor in various leases with our customers  whereby our customers lease certain stations and equipment that we own 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange rates 
commodity risk 
we are subject to market risk with respect to our sales of natural gas  which has historically been subject to volatile market conditions 
our exposure to market risk is heightened when we have a fixed price sales contract with a customer that is not covered by a futures contract  or when we are otherwise unable to pass through natural gas price increases to customers 
natural gas prices and availability are affected by many factors  including weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
natural gas costs represented or excluding baf  imw and northstar of our cost of sales for and or excluding baf  imw and northstar for prices for natural gas over the twelve year period from december  through december   based on the nymex daily futures data  have ranged from a low of per mcf to a high of per mcf 
at december   the nymex index price of natural gas was per mcf 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations in natural gas  we may enter into exchange traded natural gas futures contracts 
these arrangements also expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the other party to the contract defaults on its contract or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the contract and the actual price of natural gas we pay at the delivery point 
we account for these futures contracts in accordance with fasb authoritative guidance on derivatives 
the accounting under this guidance for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends upon whether it has been specified in a hedging relationship and  further  on the type of hedging relationship 
to qualify for designation in a hedging relationship  specific criteria must be met and appropriate documentation maintained 
the fair value of the futures contracts we use is based on quoted prices in active exchange traded or over the counter markets  which are then discounted to reflect the time value of money for contracts applicable to future periods 
the fair value of these futures contracts is continually subject to change due to market conditions 
in an effort to mitigate the volatility in our earnings related to futures activities  our board of directors adopted a revised natural gas hedging policy which restricts our ability to purchase natural gas futures contracts and to offer fixed price sales contracts to our customers 
we plan to structure prospective futures contracts so that they will be accounted for as cash flow hedges under the fasb guidance  but we cannot be certain they will qualify 
for more information  please read risk management activities above 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to the futures contracts we hold as of december  to hedge the fixed price component of certain supply contracts 
if the price of natural gas were to fluctuate increase or decrease by from the price quoted on nymex on december  per mcf  we could expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the contracts of approximately million 
foreign exchange rate risk 
because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
since the functional currency of our foreign operations is in their local currency  the currency effects of translating the financial statements of those foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of consolidated equity and do not impact earnings 
however  foreign currency transaction gains and losses not in our subsidiaries functional currency do impact earnings and resulted in approximately million of losses in during  our primary exposure to foreign currency rates related to our canadian operations that had certain outstanding notes payable denominated in the us dollar which were not hedged 
we have prepared a sensitivity analysis to estimate our exposure to market risk with respect to our monetary transactions denominated in a foreign currency 
if the exchange rate on these assets and liabilities were to fluctuate by from the rate as of december   we would expect a corresponding fluctuation in the value of the assets and liabilities of approximately million
