revenue our revenue by segment for the years ended december   and was as follows in millions year ended december  consumer business the principal sources of revenue within each segment are consumer monthly fees and usage charges for cable and non cable telephone and internet access services and cable television services  monthly fees and usage charges for mobile services including charges for airtime  data  long distance calls and roaming  installation and connection services  and charges for the supply of mobile handset and other equipment 
business monthly fees and usage charges for inbound and outbound voice  data and internet services and charges for transmission  fiber and voice services provided to retail and wholesale customers  and installation and connection services 

table of contents expenses the principal components of our operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses within each segment include consumer payroll and other employee related costs including outsourcing  television programming services and programming costs  interconnect costs paid to carriers relating to call termination services  marketing and selling costs  and purchase costs of mobile handsets and other equipment 
business payroll and other employee related costs  interconnect and circuit costs paid to other telecommunication carriers  and marketing and selling costs 
other costs of maintaining our cable network infrastructure and it systems  facility related costs  such as rent  utilities and rates  costs associated with providing customer services  and allowances for doubtful accounts 
disposal of equity investments disposals on september   we completed the sale to scripps network interactive  inc scripps  of our interest in the uktv joint venture with bbc worldwide limited 
the aggregate consideration was million  which included approximately million for scripps acquisition of preferred equity  loan stock and other debt 
after the inclusion of associated fees  this transaction resulted in a loss on disposal of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
other than an insignificant amount of us alternative minimum tax  no income tax is due as a result of this transaction due to our ability to offset net operating losses against taxable income 
factors affecting our business a number of factors affect the performance of our business  at both a general and segment level 
general factors that affect all of the segments in which we operate are as follows general macroeconomic factors 
general macroeconomic factors in the uk have an impact on our business 
for example  during an economic slowdown  potential and existing customers may be less willing  or able to purchase our products or upgrade their services 
we may also experience increased churn and higher bad debt expense 

table of contents currency and interest rate movements 
we encounter currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenue and operating costs are earned and paid primarily in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our existing indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
we have in place hedging programs that seek to mitigate the risk from these exposures 
while the objective of these programs is to reduce the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying currency exchange rates  not all of our exposures are hedged  and not all of our hedges are designated as such for accounting purposes 
additionally  we do not hedge the principal portion of our convertible senior notes 
we also purchase goods and services in us dollars  euros and south african rand  such as customer premise equipment and network maintenance services and a substantial portion of these exposures are not hedged 
we are also subject to interest rate risks 
as of december   we had interest determined on a variable basis  either through unhedged variable rate debt or derivative hedging contracts  on  million of our long term debt 
an increase in interest rates of would increase our interest cost by approximately million per year 
competition 
our ability to acquire and retain customers and increase revenue depends on our competitive strength 
there is significant competition in the market for our consumer services  including broadband and telephone services offered by bt  resellers or local loop unbundlers  such as bskyb and talk talk  alternative internet access services such as dsl  satellite television services offered by bskyb and by bbc and itv through freesat  free to air digital terrestrial television offered through freeview  internet protocol television offered by bt  and mobile telephone  television and data services offered by other mobile network operators  or mnos  including everything everywhere limited the joint venture between t mobile uk and orange uk  o  vodafone and uk  and from other mobile virtual network operators  including tesco mobile  lebara  carphone warehouse and asda 
in addition  certain competitors  such as bt  bskyb and large mnos  are dominant in markets in which we compete and may use their dominance in those markets to offer bundled services that compete with our product offerings 
as a result of increased competition  we have had to  and may be required to continue to  adjust our pricing and offer discounts to new and existing customers in order to attract and retain customers 
there is also significant competition in the market for our business services  including data and voice services offered by bt  cable wireless  virtual network operators and systems integrators 
while bt represents the main competitive threat nationally due to its network reach and product portfolio  we also compete with regional providers  such as colt telecom  which have a strong network presence within limited geographic areas 
capital expenditures 
our business requires substantial capital expenditures on a continuing basis for various purposes  including expanding  maintaining and upgrading our cable network  investing in new customer acquisitions  and offering new services 
if we do not continue to invest in our network and in new technologies  our ability to retain and acquire customers may be hindered 
therefore  our liquidity and the availability of cash to fund capital projects are important drivers of our revenue 
when our liquidity is restricted  so is our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements 
on january   we announced a major program to double the speeds of over four million broadband customers 
this will involve an incremental investment of approximately million during consumer segment in our consumer segment  cable customers account for the majority of our revenue 
the number of customers  the number and types of services that each customer uses and the prices we charge for these services drive our revenue 
our profit is driven by the relative margins on the types of services we provide to these customers and by the number of services that we provide to them and  with respect to our fixed and mobile telephone customers  by usage levels of our services 
for example  cable broadband internet is more profitable than our television services and  on average  our triple play customers are more profitable than double play or single play customers 
similarly  over the service term  our contract mobile customers are more profitable than our prepay mobile customers  and provide a better opportunity for cross sell of our cable products 
we actively promote quad play services and our packaging of services and our pricing are designed to encourage 
table of contents our customers to use multiple services such as television  fixed and mobile telephone and broadband at a lower price than each stand alone product on a combined basis 
factors particularly affecting our consumer segment include average revenue per user  or arpu  churn  competition  seasonality and distribution 
cable arpu 
cable arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing potential revenue from our residential cable customers on our network 
we believe that our triple play cable offering of television  broadband and fixed line telephone services is attractive to our existing cable customer base and generally allows us to increase our cable arpu by facilitating the sale of multiple services to each customer 
cable arpu excludes any revenue from our mobile and non cable customers 
mobile arpu 
mobile arpu is a measure we use to evaluate how effectively we are realizing revenue from our mobile customers 
the mix of prepay and contract customers and level of usage have a material impact on mobile arpu 
the mix of our customer base is changing as we focus on acquiring higher lifetime value contract customers  rather than lower lifetime value prepay customers  particularly through cross selling to our cable customer base 
consequently  the number of prepay customers is expected to continue to decline in  along with prepay usage 
churn 
churn is the proportion of customers who stop subscribing to any of our services 
an increase in our churn can lead to increased costs and reduced revenue 
we continue to focus on improving our customer service and enhancing and expanding our service offerings to existing customers in order to manage our churn rates 
our ability to reduce our churn rates beyond a base level is limited by factors such as competition  the economy and  in respect of our cable business  customers moving outside our network service area  in particular during the summer season 
managing our churn rates is a significant component of our business plan 
our churn rates may increase if our customer service is seen as unsatisfactory  if we are unable to deliver a service without interruption  if we fail to match offerings by our competitors  if we increase our prices  if there is an improvement in the uk housing market or if there is a prolonged economic downturn 
seasonality 
some of our consumer revenue streams are subject to seasonal factors 
for example  telephone usage revenue by residential customers tends to be slightly lower during summer holiday months 
in the fourth quarter of each year  our mobile customer acquisition and retention costs typically increase due to the christmas holiday period 
our mobile arpu generally decreases in the first quarter of each year due to the fewer number of days in february and lower usage after the christmas holiday period 
our churn rates include persons who disconnect their service because of moves  resulting in a seasonal increase in our churn rates during the summer months when higher levels of uk house moves occur and students leave their accommodation between academic years 
in addition  our revenue and cost of sales tend to be lower in the first quarter of any year as compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter of the prior year 
historically  there has been lower telephony usage including mobile  as noted above in the first quarter and less spending on a variety of products and services in a first quarter than in a fourth quarter 
distribution 
we use certain third parties to distribute our mobile products and services 
if any of these distribution partners were to cease to act as distributors for our products and services  or the commissions or other costs charged by the third parties were to increase  our ability to gain new mobile customers or retain existing customers may be adversely affected 
we continue to increase the proportion of our products distributed through our own channels including our retail outlets 
business segment factors particularly affecting our business segment include pricing  operational effectiveness and changes in government spending 
pricing 
competition in the uk business telecommunications market continues to be based on value for money  the key components of which are quality  reliability and price 
certain of bt s product pricing is 
table of contents regulated by the uk office of communications  however  in respect of non regulated product pricing  the market is increasingly price sensitive  particularly in the current challenging economic conditions 
operational effectiveness 
the extensive use of optical fiber in our access networks allows us to provide high speed ethernet services directly to business customers and to provide nationwide area networking to these customers via our core networks 
business customers require timely installation services and our ability to meet required timescales and commence providing services may impact our revenues 
we regularly rely on third party suppliers to connect business customers and we have a variety of alternative methods to connect our national telecommunications network to the premises of business customers that are located outside of our cabled areas 
government spending 
public sector organizations  in particular local authorities  represent a significant proportion of the customer base in our business segment 
accordingly  changes to the uk government s allocation of funding and spending levels with respect to certain programs have had  and may continue to have  an effect on our business segment revenue 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and related financial information are based on the application of us gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported  as well as disclosures about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the following critical accounting policies have the potential to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
an impact could occur because of the significance of the financial statement item to which these policies relate  or because these policies require more judgment and estimation than other matters owing to the uncertainty related to measuring  at a specific point in time  transactions that are continuous in nature 
we have discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them 
these policies may need to be revised in the future in the event that changes to our business occur 
fixed assets we assign fixed assets and intangible assets useful lives that impact the annual depreciation and amortization expense 
the assignment of useful lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
our management use their experience and expertise in applying judgments about appropriate estimates 
we also compare the useful lives assigned to fixed assets to other companies that operate similar business 
changes in technology or changes in intended use of these assets may cause the estimated useful life to change  resulting in higher or lower depreciation charges or asset impairment charges 
as an example  we have reviewed the useful lives of the assets that support our non tivo television set top box platform based on our current intentions 
while we have concluded that no adjustment to the useful lives is required  it is possible that a material change to our current plans could change this conclusion 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives to be held and used by an entity are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the property  plant and equipment topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 
indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted projected future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  the amount of the impairment is the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets 

table of contents costs associated with construction and installation activities labor and overhead costs directly related to the construction and installation of fixed assets  including payroll and related costs of some employees and related rent and other occupancy costs  are capitalized 
the payroll and related costs of some employees that are directly related to construction and installation activities are capitalized based on specific time devoted to these activities where identifiable 
in cases where the time devoted to these activities is not specifically identifiable  we capitalize costs based upon estimated allocations 
costs associated with initial customer installations are capitalized 
the costs of reconnecting the same service to a previously installed premise are charged to expense in the period incurred 
costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
the nature and amount of labor and other costs to be capitalized with respect to construction and installation activities involves significant judgment 
in addition to direct external and internal labor and materials  we also capitalize other costs directly attributable to our construction and installation activities 
we continuously monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and update the policy when necessary to respond to changes in facts and circumstances  such as the development of new products and services  and changes in the manner that installations or construction activities are performed 
taxes as of december  we had gross deferred tax assets  including capital losses and net operating losses totaling  million 
we are required to apply significant judgment regarding future events in determining the likelihood that we will be able to utilize these assets to reduce taxable income in future periods 
we consider historical results  tax planning strategies  and future taxable income when performing this evaluation 
we record a valuation allowance on tax assets that we believe are unlikely to be utilized to reduce taxable income in the future 
as of december   the allowance recorded was  million which reduced our gross deferred tax assets to a net value of million  because of our assessment of our inability to benefit from these tax assets in the future 
in assessing the likelihood regarding the utilization of tax assets  we apply the rules in the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
based on our application of these rules  we determined that our cumulative pre tax losses over the three year period ended december  represent a significant piece of negative evidence that require us to conclude that it is unlikely that we will be able to utilize any of these tax assets to reduce future taxable income 
if we continue to generate pre tax income as we have done in the year ended december  such that we are not in a cumulative loss position over the most recent three year measurement period  we will place more weight on other factors  including our projections of future profitability  and may change our assessment of the likelihood of utilizing a portion of these assets  however  no assurances can be provided that our future results will be consistent with our results for the year ended december  new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued new guidance to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
the new standard will require companies to retrospectively present items of net income  items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements  and companies will no longer be allowed to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
this new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting rules and disclosures can significantly impact our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements 
there are new proposals under development regarding revenue and leasing transactions which  if and when enacted  may have a material impact on our financial reporting 

table of contents consolidated results of operations consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue our revenue by segment for the years ended december  and was as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease consumer business for the year ended december   revenue increased by to  million from  million for the same period in this increase was due to higher revenue in both our consumer and business segments 
see further discussion of our consumer and business segments below 
operating costs operating costs for the years ended december  and were as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease operating costs consumer cost of sales business cost of sales network and other operating costs total operating costs for the year ended december   operating costs  including network expenses  increased by to  million from  million during the same period in this increase was primarily attributable to increases in consumer segment and business segment cost of sales  partially offset by a decrease in network and other operating costs 
consumer segment cost of sales increased primarily as a result of increased revenues  partially offset by lower fixed line and mobile telephony interconnect costs as a result of lower usage 
business cost of sales increased as the impact on costs of increased install activity and higher retail and wholesale data revenues was only partially offset by lower retail and wholesale voice cost of sales 
network and other operating costs declined primarily as a result of lower facilities costs on our network properties due to the current year benefiting from a reduction in rent and related costs due to accrual adjustments in connection with a review of our property portfolio 
as a result of these changes  along with a increase in revenue  total operating costs as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the year from for the year ended december  
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and were as follows in millions year ended december  increase decrease selling  general and administrative expenses employee and outsourcing costs marketing costs facilities other total selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to higher marketing and other costs  partially offset by lower employee and outsourcing costs and facilities costs 
higher marketing costs were primarily as a result of increased marketing activity  mainly in connection with the launch of tivo services 
other costs increased primarily as a result of a higher bad debt expense 
employee and outsourcing costs reduced compared to the prior year primarily as a result of reduced costs in relation to employee incentive programs 
facilities costs were relatively unchanged  however the current year benefited from of a reduction in rent and related property costs resulting from accrual adjustments in connection with a review of our property portfolio 
as a result  facilities costs are expected to increase in restructuring and other charges during the fourth quarter of  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan aimed at driving further improvements in our operational performance and eliminating inefficiencies in order to create a fully integrated  customer focused organization 
though the majority of the plan is substantially complete  the remaining portion of the plan is expected to be completed by the end of and involves the incurrence of certain operating and capital expenditures  including certain costs which we expect to treat as restructuring 
for the year ended december   restructuring and other charges decreased to million from million for the same period in restructuring and other charges in the year ended december  related primarily to lease exit costs and involuntary employee termination costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in restructuring and other charges in the year ended december  related primarily to lease exit costs  including the cost of vacating property leases on our great portland street office in central london  and involuntary employee termination costs in connection with the restructuring program initiated in as discussed below

amortization expense for the year ended december   amortization expense decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in amortization expense was primarily attributable to the cessation of amortization of our intangible assets  all of which became fully amortized in interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to million from million for the same period in  primarily due to a reduction in the level of debt and lower borrowing costs on our debt along with the effect of interest and cross currency rate swaps designated as accounting hedges 
we paid cash interest of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash interest payments was primarily as a result of a lower level of debt at lower average interest rates during the year ended december   along with differences in the timing of interest payments on our senior credit facility and senior notes due to refinancing activity undertaken during the years ended december  and loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  which related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of the repayments of our senior credit facility from the net proceeds of the senior secured notes issued on march   the refinancing of our senior credit facility on may  and the redemption of our senior notes on july  for the year ended december   loss on extinguishment of debt was million  which related to the write off of deferred financing costs as a result of the partial repayments of our senior credit facility in and the call premium totaling million on the repayment of a portion of the senior notes due

the loss related to the disposal of our share in the uktv companies 
loss on derivative instruments the loss on derivative instruments of million in the year ended december  was primarily driven by the loss on the conversion hedges as a result of a decrease in the price of our common stock and an increase in the amount of the counterparty credit risk adjustment used in the calculation of the fair values of the conversion hedges  and losses on derivative instruments resulting from a fall in interest rates  partially offset by the reclassification of gains of million on derivative instruments previously designated as accounting hedges from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings in conjunction with the discontinuance of hedge accounting on these instruments 
the losses on derivative instruments of million in the year ended december  were mainly driven by the termination of swaps relating to the previous senior credit facility refinanced in march additionally  the loss on derivative instruments for the year ended december  includes a loss of million related to our conversion hedges  which represents the difference between the cash we paid and the fair value  as of december   and a loss of million related to cross currency interest swaps on our us dollar convertible senior notes that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
foreign currency losses for the year ended december   foreign currency losses were million as compared with losses of million for the same period in the foreign currency losses for the year ended december   were primarily due to remeasurement gains on our convertible senior notes and us dollar denominated senior notes due  offset by the weakening of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar 
the foreign currency losses for the year ended december  were primarily due to the weakening of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar and related foreign exchange gains on the principal portion of our us dollar convertible senior notes 
interest income and other  net for the year ended december   interest income and other increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the million recognized in the consolidated statement of operations during the second quarter following the agreement with the uk tax authorities regarding the value added tax  or vat  treatment of certain of our revenue generating activities and a related refund 

table of contents income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   income tax expense was million as compared with a benefit of million for the same period in the and tax expense benefit was comprised of in millions current federal state and local foreign total current deferred federal foreign total deferred total the income tax expense for the year ended december  related primarily to our discontinuance of hedge accounting for the swaps associated with the million senior notes that were prepaid during the year  which resulted in a reclassification of tax effects associated with gains on those swaps from accumulated other comprehensive income 
this expense was partially offset by consortium tax relief receivable from our joint venture operations  which were sold during the foreign current tax benefit and the foreign deferred tax benefit for the year ended december   were primarily driven by the application of the intraperiod allocation rules of the income taxes topic of the fasb asc 
the foreign current tax benefit attributable to continuing operations includes million related to the gain on discontinued operations and is offset by tax expense of million that is included within discontinued operations 
the million foreign deferred tax benefit attributable to continuing operations is offset by tax expense of million that is included within other comprehensive as a result of gains in other comprehensive income during additionally  during we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards prior to their expiration  which will occur between and  to reduce future us federal income tax liabilities 
accordingly  we reduced the previously established valuation allowance on these net operating loss carryforwards to nil and recorded a federal deferred tax benefit of million 
this change was due to a re assessment of our intentions regarding certain assets during the carryforward period and our judgment that it is more likely than not that these nols will be utilized prior to expiry 
income loss from continuing operations for the year ended december   the net income from continuing operations was million  compared with a loss of million for the same period in due to the factors discussed above

no uk income tax is due as a result of the gain on disposal of virgin media tv due to our ability to offset capital losses and capital allowances against this income 
the tax expense associated with the income on discontinued operations is offset with an equivalent tax benefit in continuing operations 
basic income loss from continuing operations per share basic income from continuing operations per common share for the year ended december  was compared to a basic loss per share of for the year ended december  basic income loss per share is computed using a weighted average of million shares issued and outstanding in the year ended december  and a weighted average of million shares issued and outstanding for the same period in contingent losses our vat treatment of certain other revenue generating activities remains subject to challenge by the uk tax authorities 
as a result  we have estimated contingent losses totaling million as of december  that are not accrued for  as we deem them to be reasonably possible  but not probable  of resulting in a liability 
we currently expect an initial hearing on these matters to take place in segmental results of operations for the years ended december  and a description of the products and services  as well as financial data  for each segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements of virgin media inc the reportable segments disclosed in this document are based on our management organizational structure as of december  segment contribution  which is operating income loss before network operating costs  corporate costs  depreciation  amortization  goodwill and intangible asset impairments and restructuring and other charges  is management s measure of segment profit 
segment contribution excludes the impact of certain costs and expenses that are not directly attributable to the reporting segments  such as the costs of operating the network  corporate costs  depreciation and amortization 
restructuring and other charges  and goodwill and intangible asset impairments  are excluded from segment contribution as management believes they are not characteristic of our underlying business operations

table of contents convertible notes during the following quarter 
if conversions of this nature occur  we may deliver cash  common stock  or a combination of both  at our election  to settle our obligations 
we have classified this debt as long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  because we determined  in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb asc  that we have the ability to settle the obligations in equity in all circumstances  except in the case of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the convertible senior notes 
this condition must be fulfilled on of the last trading days of each calendar quarter

we account for certain of these instruments as accounting hedges  in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic of the fasb asc  when the appropriate eligibility criteria has been satisfied  and to the extent that they are effective 
ineffectiveness in our accounting hedges  and movements in the fair value of instruments that we have not elected for hedge accounting  are recognized through the consolidated statement of operations immediately 
effective cash flow accounting hedges are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded within other comprehensive income loss 
effective fair value accounting hedges are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value with changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the carrying value of the debt recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the derivative instruments consist of interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we are also subject to interest rate risks 
before taking into account the impact of current hedging arrangements  as of december   we would have had interest determined on a variable basis on million  or  of our long term debt 
an increase in interest rates of would increase unhedged gross interest expense by approximately million per year 

table of contents we are also subject to currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues  operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are paid in uk pounds sterling  but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a portion of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
to the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the us dollar and the euro  the effective cost of servicing our us dollar and euro denominated debt will be higher

the interest rate swaps allow us to receive or pay interest based on three or six month libor in exchange for payments or receipts of interest at fixed rates 
we have designated some of the interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges because they hedge against changes in libor 
all interest rate swaps are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value are recorded within other comprehensive income loss where designated as an accounting hedge  or through loss gain on derivatives where not designated as an accounting hedge

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
as some of our indebtedness accrues interest at variable rates  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with variable interest rate payments 
also  substantially all of our revenues  operating costs and selling  general and administrative expenses are earned and paid in pounds sterling but we pay interest and principal obligations on some of our indebtedness in us dollars and euros 
as of december    million  or  of our indebtedness based upon contractual obligations  was denominated in us dollars and million  or  of our indebtedness based upon contractual obligations  was denominated in euros 
as a result  we have exposure to volatility in future cash flows and earnings associated with changes in foreign exchange rates on payments of principal and interest on a portion of our indebtedness 
we have also committed and forecasted purchases of goods and services in us dollars  euros and south african rand 
to mitigate the risk from these exposures  we have implemented a cash flow hedging program 
the objective of this program is to reduce but not eliminate the volatility of our cash flows and earnings caused by changes in underlying rates 
to achieve this objective we have entered into a number of derivative instruments 
the derivative instruments utilized comprise interest rate swaps  cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of virgin media inc and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations derivative instruments and hedging activities
