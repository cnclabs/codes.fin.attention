item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal year  total revenues increased over fiscal year gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year from fiscal year primarily due to decreases in oncology systems and sip gross margins  although these were partially offset by an increase in x ray products gross margin 
net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share increased in fiscal year over fiscal year during fiscal year  we repurchased million shares of vms common stock 
net orders increased in fiscal year over fiscal year growth in net orders from oncology systems  x ray products and varian particle therapy vpt was partially offset by a decrease in sip net orders 
including million in vpt backlog  our backlog at the end of fiscal year was higher than at the end of fiscal year we do not know what impact the affordable care act will have on long term growth or demand for our products and services 
the affordable care act imposes a new medical device excise tax of on sales or uses of taxable medical devices after december  many of the hardware and software products we sell are considered taxable medical devices 
generally  we do not expect that our service contracts will be considered taxable and there are excise tax exceptions for export sales and for sales for further manufacture 
we are also allowed to reduce the amount on which the tax is based for our cost of freight and installation 
the medical device excise tax is likely to have a negative impact on our gross margin percentage 
we are focused on enhancing our operational performance through productivity initiatives 
as part of this effort  we expect to recognize a restructuring charge in the first half of fiscal year we have classified research instruments as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of earnings 
as of september   we had no remaining obligations related to research instruments  which was previously included in the other category 
unless otherwise stated  the discussion in this md a pertains to our continuing operations 
oncology systems 
our largest business segment is oncology systems  which designs  manufacturers  sells and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with conventional radiotherapy  including imrt  igrt  and volumetric modulated arc therapy  stereotactic radiotherapy  sbrt  srs  and brachytherapy 
we have recently seen a greater percentage of oncology systems net orders and revenues coming from emerging markets within our international region  such as china  thailand  south korea and russia  which typically demand lower priced products compared to developed markets 
we expect that this shift in geographic mix of net orders and revenues will generally continue and may negatively impact oncology systems gross margin 
in the past  we have seen our customers decision making process complicated by the uncertainties surrounding reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the united states  such as we experienced in with the reductions to reimbursement rates for radiation therapy proposed by cms 
in october  we acquired calypso  a supplier of specialized products and software for real time tumor tracking and motion management during radiosurgery and radiotherapy 
in april  we entered into a strategic global partnership with siemens through which  among other things  we represent siemens diagnostic imaging products to radiation oncology clinics initially in most international markets and  since november  in north america 
siemens  in turn  represents our equipment and software products for radiotherapy and radiosurgery within its offerings to its healthcare customers in agreed upon regions 
furthermore  we and siemens are working on developing interfaces to enable our aria software to connect with siemens linear accelerators and imaging systems  as well as exploring opportunities to co develop new imaging and treatment solutions 

table of contents oncology systems net orders increased  or on a constant currency basis  in fiscal year over fiscal year reflecting increased net orders in both the international region and north america 
in fiscal year  oncology systems total revenues rose over fiscal year  with a increase in north america and a increase in the international region 
the service contract business and software products were significant to contributors of growth in oncology systems net orders and revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year oncology systems gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in product gross margin percentage partially offset by an increase in service gross margin percentage 
through september   we had received orders for more than truebeam systems since its introduction in the second quarter of fiscal year and had about systems installed or in progress 
x ray products 
our x ray products business segment designs  manufactures  sells and services x ray imaging components for use in a range of applications  including radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging  mammography  special procedures  ct and industrial applications 
in april  we acquired infimed  inc infimed  a supplier of hardware and software for processing diagnostic x ray images 
our success in our x ray products business depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets  the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers 
we are currently in the process of introducing multiple new products which we believe will help sustain the growth of our x ray products business 
in addition  changes in access to diagnostic radiology or the reimbursement rates associated with diagnostic radiology as a result of the affordable care act and similar state proposals  or otherwise  could affect demand for our products in our x ray products business 
in fiscal year  both x ray products net orders and revenues increased over the fiscal year although our x ray products business experienced softer demand from major customers during fiscal year  this business saw new products introduced in the second half of fiscal year begin to contribute to growth in net orders and revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year x ray products gross margin for the fiscal year increased over fiscal year primarily due to improved quality costs for our flat panel products and a greater proportion of higher margin products 
other 
the other category is comprised of i sip  which designs  manufactures  sells and services linatron x ray accelerators  imaging processing software and image detection products including intellx tm for security and inspection purposes  ii our vpt business  which designs  develops  manufactures  sells and services products and systems for delivering proton therapy treatments  and iii the operations of the gtc  our scientific research facility 
net orders in the other category increased million in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to vpt recording two proton therapy systems orders  compared to one in fiscal year one proton therapy system will be installed at the ptc st 
petersburg center of nuclear medicine of the international institute of biological systems in russia and the other will be installed at the king fahd medical center in riyadh  saudi arabia 
the increase in vpt net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was partially offset by a decline in sip net orders 
revenues in our other category increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in sip revenues 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information contained under item a  risk factors 
we discuss our results of operations below 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other 
table of contents factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies  estimates and assumptions and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  share based compensation expense  valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of warranty obligations  assessment of loss contingencies  valuation of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans  valuation of derivative instruments and taxes on earnings 
such accounting policies require us to use judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  see item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
judgments as to the allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with gaap 
the allocation of consideration in a multiple element arrangement is affected by the determination of whether any software deliverables that function together with other hardware components to deliver the hardware products essential functionality are considered as non software products for purpose of revenue recognition 
the allocation of consideration to each non software deliverable is based on the assumptions we use to establish its selling price  which are based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence of selling price  if it exists  and if not on estimated selling prices 
in addition  the allocation of consideration to each software deliverable in a multiple element arrangement is affected by our judgment as to whether vsoe of its fair value exists in these arrangements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the amounts allocated to each element could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment  the readiness of customers facilities for installation or is subject to customer acceptance 
if shipments or installations are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
in addition  revenues related to certain highly customized image detection systems  proton therapy systems and proton therapy system commissioning contracts are recognized in accordance with contract accounting 
for contracts in which we can estimate contract costs with reasonable dependability  we recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method 
revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method are based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total contract cost or the extent of progress towards completion are recognized in the period in which the changes in estimates are identified 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the loss is identified 
in circumstances in which the final outcome of a contract cannot be precisely estimated but a loss on the contract is not expected  we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin until more precise estimates can be made 
if and when we can make more precise estimates  revenues and costs of revenues are adjusted in the same period 
because the percentage of completion method involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the dollar amounts to relevant accounting periods  and because the estimates must be periodically reviewed and appropriately adjusted  if our estimates prove to be inaccurate or circumstances change over time  we may be forced to adjust revenues or even record a contract loss in later periods 

table of contents share based compensation expense we value our stock options granted and the option component of the shares of vms common stock purchased under the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
we value our performance units using the monte carlo simulation model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant under both the black scholes option pricing model and the monte carlo simulation model is affected by vms s stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions  including the expected terms of share based awards and the expected price volatilities of shares of vms common stock and peer companies that are used to assess certain performance targets over the expected term of the awards  and the dividend yield of vms 
the expected term of our stock options is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and post vesting cancellations of stock options by our employees 
we determined the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees and retirement eligibility 
we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption for our stock options 
blended volatility represents the weighted average of implied volatility and historical volatility 
implied volatility is derived based on traded options on vms common stock 
implied volatility is weighted in the calculation of blended volatility based on the ratio of the term of the exchange traded options to the expected terms of the employee stock options 
historical volatility represents the remainder of the weighting 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options on vms common stock is reflective of market conditions and is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
in determining the extent of use of implied volatility  we considered i the volume of market activity of traded options  ii the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of stock options granted by us  including the date of grant  iii the similarity of the exercise prices  and iv the length of term of traded options 
after considering the above factors  we determined that we could not rely exclusively on implied volatility based on the fact that the term of vms exchange traded options is less than one year and that it is different from the expected terms of the stock options we grant 
therefore  we believe a combination of the historical volatility over the expected terms of the stock options we grant and the implied volatility of exchange traded options best reflects the expected volatility of vms common stock 
in determining the grant date fair value of our performance units  historical volatilities of shares of vms common stock  as well as the shares of common stock of peer companies  were used to assess certain performance targets 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  as well as the probability that certain performance conditions that affect the vesting of performance units will be achieved  and recognize expense only for those awards expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate and or the actual number of performance units that vest based on achievement of performance conditions are materially different from our estimates  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions 
except for government tenders  group purchases and orders with letters of credit in oncology systems and sip  and orders in our x ray products business  our payment terms usually require payment of a small portion of the total amount due when the customer signs the purchase order  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss to the customer and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable 
table of contents aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected 
inventories our inventories include high technology parts and components that are highly specialized in nature and that are subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and on order and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the majority of businesses that we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  we have typically allocated a significant portion of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to these intangibles or to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist 
the allocation of the purchase price from business acquisitions to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for those cash flows 
should conditions differ from management s estimates at the time of the acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  if any  consists of a comparison of fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the most recent annual goodwill impairment testing that we performed in fiscal year for each of our four reporting units with goodwill oncology systems  x ray products  sip and vpt  the fair value of each such reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
warranty obligations we warrant most of our products for a specific period of time  usually months  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of 
table of contents sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends  if required 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty costs in the future  it would have a negative effect on our operating results 
loss contingencies from time to time  we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings  claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters  both inside and outside the united states  arising in the ordinary course of its business or otherwise 
we accrue amounts  to the extent they can be reasonably estimated  that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss 
however  such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
if actual liabilities significantly exceed the estimates made  our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world 
those laws regulate multiple aspects of our operations  including the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous substances 
they impose costs on our operations 
in connection with our past and present operations and facilities  we record environmental remediation liabilities when we conclude that environmental assessments or remediation efforts are probable and we believe we can reasonably estimate the costs of those efforts 
our accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate of the total costs of assessments and remediation and the time period over which we expect to incur those costs 
we review these accrued balances quarterly 
if we were required to increase or decrease the accrued environmental costs in the future  it would adversely or favorably impact our operating results 
defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans we sponsor five defined benefit pension plans in germany  japan  switzerland where we have two defined benefit pension plans and the united kingdom covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements in these countries 
in fiscal year  the company terminated one pension plan in germany upon the death of the last participant in the plan 
although we do not have any defined benefit pension plans in the united states  we sponsor a post retirement benefit plan that provides healthcare benefits to certain eligible retirees 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefits are actuarially determined  such as our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and rate of healthcare cost increases  all of which we determine within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the expenses and liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience particularly in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plan expenses we record 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return on those assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries are based primarily on the yields of a universe of high quality corporate bonds in each applicable country or the spot rate of high quality aa rated corporate bonds  
table of contents with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations 
a change in the discount rate will cause the present value of benefit obligations to change in the opposite direction 
valuation of derivative instruments we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency rate fluctuations on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies and on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivative instruments and are measured at fair value 
asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  fair value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are calculated primarily using level inputs  which include currency spot and forward rates  interest rate and credit or non performance risk 
the spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet translations at the measurement date and sourced from our major trading banks 
the forward point values for each currency and the london interbank offered rate libor to discount assets and liabilities are interpolated from commonly quoted broker services 
one year credit default swap spreads of the counterparty at the measurement date are used to adjust derivative assets  all of which mature in months or less  for non performance risk 
we are required to adjust derivative liabilities to reflect the potential non performance risk to lenders based on our incremental borrowing rate 
each contract is individually adjusted using the counterparty credit default swap rates for net assets or our borrowing rate for net liabilities 
the use of level inputs in determining fair values requires certain management judgment and subjectivity 
changes to these level inputs could have a material impact on the valuation of our derivative instruments  as well as on our result of operations 
there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value measurement levels during fiscal years  and taxes on earnings we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the provisions in asc related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes contain a two step approach to recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that  based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
recognition  derecognition and measurement are based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the end of the accounting period 
a tax benefit should be recognized in the first period in which it meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  and conversely  a tax benefit previously recognized should be derecognized in the first period in which new information results in a change in judgment in which the position fails to meet the recognition threshold 
a benefit not previously recognized would be recognized when the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation with tax authorities  or when the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on earnings 
generally  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in the applicable tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets 
should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets in these tax jurisdictions  we would increase our valuation allowance and our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination 

table of contents our foreign earnings are generally taxed at rates lower than us rates 
our effective tax rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries do business 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our foreign countries  or a change in the mix of foreign countries among particular tax jurisdictions could increase or decrease our effective tax rate 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on certain undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states

table of contents varying cycles of higher and lower revenues between the north american and international regions and among countries in the international region are impacted by regional influences  which recently have included the implementation and termination of government economic stimulus programs  the pace of economic recovery and actual or anticipated recession  the european sovereign debt and banking crises  different technology adoption cycles consistent with the net order patterns and  in the united states  uncertainty created by healthcare reform  including the excise tax on the sale of most medical devices that will go into effect at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year and actual and proposed reductions in medicare reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery 
see further discussion of net orders under net orders 
additionally  we are now seeing a greater percentage of oncology systems net orders and revenues come from the emerging markets within our international region  which typically have purchased less complex  lower priced products compared to more developed markets and which usually have stiffer price competition 
we expect this shift to generally continue

in addition  total company gross margin percentage was negatively impacted in fiscal year and fiscal year by the recognition of revenues relating to the scripps proton therapy center with a zero profit margin

table of contents was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year the affordable care act imposes a new medical device excise tax of on sales or uses of taxable medical devices after december  many of the hardware and software products we sell are considered taxable medical devices 
generally  we do not expect that our service contracts will be considered taxable and there are excise tax exceptions for export sales and for sales for further manufacture 
we are also allowed to reduce the amount on which the tax is based for our cost of freight and installation 
the medical device excise tax is likely to have a negative impact on our gross margin percentage 
oncology systems gross margin decreased percentage points in fiscal year from fiscal year due to a decrease in product gross margin  partially offset by an increase in service contract and other gross margin 
oncology systems product gross margin decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year primarily due to a geographic shift of product revenues away from developed markets to emerging markets  which typically have purchased less complex  lower priced products compared to developed markets 
our oncology systems product gross margins for fiscal year were further impacted by stiffer pricing pressure in our international region  particularly in the higher growth emerging markets 
improved installation  warranty and factory costs in fiscal years from fiscal year partially offset these increases 
oncology systems service contract and other gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the increases in service contract gross margin were primarily due to higher service contract volume which lowered the costs per contract and cost control measures in fiscal year in addition  the us dollar strengthened against the euro and weakened against the japanese yen in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  such that the differences in currency exchange rates largely offset each other when oncology systems gross margin was measured in us dollars 
we believe the shift of oncology systems revenues towards emerging markets will generally continue and may negatively impact oncology systems gross margin 
oncology systems gross margin in fiscal year increased percentage point over fiscal year primarily due to increases in both service contract and other gross margin and product gross margin 
oncology systems service contract and other gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the increase in service contract and other gross margin was primarily due to higher service contract volume partially offset by higher product retrofit costs 
oncology systems product gross margin increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year  primarily due to higher proportion of product revenues from our truebeam system which carries higher gross margins compared with our other linear accelerators in fiscal year than fiscal year x ray products gross margin increased percentage points in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to improved quality costs for our flat panel products and higher margin products representing a greater proportion of x ray products sales in fiscal year than fiscal year x ray products gross margin improved percentage point in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to higher sales volume  and flat panel products which carry higher gross margins representing a greater proportion of sales in fiscal year than fiscal year as well as lower costs of quality for our x ray tube products 
the decrease in sip gross margin in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to lower margin products representing a greater proportion of sip s sales in fiscal year than fiscal year the improvement in sip gross margin in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to higher margin products representing a greater proportion of sip s sales in fiscal year than fiscal year

interest income  net fiscal years dollars in millions change change interest income expense  net the net increase in interest income  net of interest expense  in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to interest income generated from our loan to cptc  the commitment for which was executed in september this increase was partially offset by an increase in interest expense associated with increased borrowing from our credit facilities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the net increase in interest income  net  in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to lower interest expenses associated with lower levels of long term debt in fiscal year compared to fiscal year taxes on earnings fiscal years change change effective tax rate the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings  partially offset by a smaller net benefit for discrete items in fiscal year related to the prior period 
these discrete items were primarily related to the release of certain liabilities for uncertain tax positions  including the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions and the favorable resolution of several income tax audits 
the slight decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the benefit from discrete items in fiscal year  including a greater release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions  partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from the foreign rate differential in fiscal year from fiscal year in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are  on average  lower than the us federal rate  and our domestic earnings are subject to state income taxes 
we expect our future effective tax rate may fluctuate due to changes in geographic mix of earnings  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws 
for example  recent proposals would make significant changes to us taxation of us based multinational corporations 
although we cannot predict whether or in what form congress would enact any such proposals  legislation of this type could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
we also expect that our effective tax rate may experience fluctuation from period to period under the provisions in asc related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes

these positive impacts on net earnings were partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage and a million restructuring charge in fiscal year primarily for a workforce reduction in north america that accompanies the realignment of resources to support sales and marketing activities in emerging markets 
the increase in net earnings from continuing operations per diluted share in fiscal year over fiscal year resulted from i an increase in total revenues  ii an improvement in gross margin percentage  iii a decrease in effective tax rate and iv a reduction in the number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding due mainly to the various accelerated stock repurchase programs that were executed in fiscal year net orders total net orders by segment and region fiscal years dollars in millions change change oncology systems north america total international total oncology systems x ray products north america total international total x ray products other total net orders oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year on a constant currency basis  oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year both the international region and north america contributed to the growth in oncology systems net orders in fiscal years and over the respective prior fiscal years 
the increase in international oncology systems net orders was primarily due to growth in orders for our service contracts in all international regions  as well as increased orders for our linear accelerators and our software products in asia and europe 
when measured in constant currency  international oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year the growth in north american oncology systems net orders was primarily due to the continued growth in orders for our service contracts  as well as increased orders for our software products and tumor tracking products offered by recently acquired calypso  which increases were partially offset by a decrease in orders for our high energy linear accelerators 
the growth in international oncology systems net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increased orders for our high energy linear accelerators in europe and the rest of the world region  partially offset by a decline in orders for our high energy linear accelerators in asia  where a supplemental spending program in japan contributed to very high order levels in the first half of fiscal 
table of contents year growth in orders for our service contracts and software upgrades in all international regions also contributed to the growth in international oncology systems net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year when measured in constant currency  international oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year the growth in north american oncology systems net orders in the fiscal year over fiscal year  helped in part by strong net orders growth in canada  was primarily due to increased orders for our high energy linear accelerators and software upgrades  as well as growth in orders for our service contracts 
the trailing months growth in net orders for oncology systems for the three immediately prior fiscal quarters ends were a total increase  with a increase in north america and an increase for the international region  as of june   an total increase  with flat net orders in north america and a increase for the international region  as of march   an total increase  with a decrease in north america and a increase for the international region  as of december  we expect that oncology systems net orders will continue to experience regional fluctuations  even with an overall shift of orders towards the international region and emerging markets 
in addition  the availability of government programs that stimulate the purchase of healthcare products  such as the one in place in in japan  and  in the united states  uncertainty created by healthcare reform and actual and proposed reductions in medicare reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery have in the past affected and could in the future affect the demand for our oncology systems products and or revenues recognized from period to period  and could therefore make it difficult to compare our financial results 
x ray products net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year x ray products net orders in north america were flat in fiscal year compared to fiscal year north american net order increases in fiscal year over fiscal year attributable to our flat panel products and our image processing tools offered by the recently acquired infimed were offset by a decrease in net orders for our x ray tube products 
in the international region  the increase in x ray products net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increased orders for our flat panel products in all international regions and increased orders for our x ray tube products in europe  as well as orders for image processing tools offered by the recently acquired infimed in europe and asia 
these increases were partially offset by lower orders for our x ray tube products in asia and rest of the world region in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in x ray products net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in both north american and international net orders 
increased demand for both the x ray tube products and the flat panel products contributed the increase in north american x ray products net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in international x ray products net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to increased orders for x ray tube products in asia and europe and increased orders for flat panel products in europe  partially offset by a decline in net orders for flat panel products in asia 
net orders in the other category increased million in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to vpt recording two proton therapy system orders  compared to recording one proton therapy system order in fiscal year in fiscal year  vpt recorded a million order to supply a proton therapy system for a two room proton therapy center at the ptc st 
petersburg center of nuclear medicine of the international institute of biological systems in russia 
in addition  we recorded a million order of which million was allocated to vpt and the remaining amount allocated to oncology systems to supply a proton therapy system and two truebeam linear accelerators for a five room proton therapy center at the king fahd medical center in riyadh  saudi arabia 
in fiscal year  vpt recorded an million order from cptc for the scripps proton therapy center 
the increase in vpt net orders for fiscal year over fiscal year was partially offset by a decline in sip net orders 
the decline in sip net orders was primarily due to sip booking a million one time order from us customs and border protection for five of our intellx cargo screening systems in fiscal year 
table of contents net orders in the other category increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year with vpt recording the million order from cptc for the scripps proton therapy center project in fiscal year and cancelling the million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken in fiscal year the increase in net orders in the other category in fiscal year over fiscal year was also attributable to a million increase in net orders in sip primarily due to increased orders for linatron x ray accelerators for cargo screening and border protection and a million one time order from us customs and border protection for five of our intellx cargo screening systems 
orders in any period may not be directly correlated to the level of revenues in any particular future quarter or period since the timing of revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders  the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products or acceptance schedules 
moreover  certain types of orders  such as orders for software or newly introduced products in our oncology systems segment  typically take more time from recording the order to completion of installation and acceptance than hardware or older products 
because an order for a proton therapy system can be relatively large  an order in one fiscal period will cause our net orders to vary significantly  making comparisons between fiscal periods more difficult 
orders and revenues for our sip products have been and may continue to be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place large orders with us or with our oem customers over a short period of time and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter 
furthermore  bid awards in the vpt and sip businesses may be subject to challenge by third parties  which can make these orders more unpredictable than other products 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we approved a plan to sell research instruments in order to focus our efforts on the development of the proton therapy systems portion of the accel business 
the sale of research instruments was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year research instruments has been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented 
in fiscal year  we recognized a loss of million for additional cost to settle one research instruments customer contract and estimated costs to complete and settle the other research instruments customer contract 
in fiscal year  we recognized a loss of million for additional costs to settle the remaining customer contract 
these contracts had been accounted for under the percentage of completion method  under which revenues and costs of sales are adjusted to reflect changes in estimated costs to complete the contracts 
including the additional loss recognized for these contracts  the total losses from discontinued operations for fiscal years and were million and million  less applicable income tax of zero for both years  respectively 
total revenues of research instruments  reported in discontinued operations  for fiscal years and were zero and million  respectively 
as of september   we had no remaining obligations related to this discontinued operation

the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were accounts receivable  advance payments from customers  prepaid expenses and other current assets  and inventories as follows accounts receivable increased million due to higher revenues and timing of collections 
advance payments from customers increased by million due to receipts of down payments for oncology system and vpt orders for which revenues have not been recognized during fiscal year prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by million primarily due to guaranteed prepayments made under a commercial agreement for products that we resell  as well as timing of expense payments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to three primary types of market risks credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk and counterparty risk we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign currency forward contracts used in hedging activities 
these counterparties are large international and regional financial institutions and to date  no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligation to us under such contracts 
we are also exposed to credit loss in the event of default by cptc  the obligor under the loan facility in which we are participating to finance the construction and start up operations of the scripps proton therapy center 
in addition  cash and cash equivalents held with financial institutions may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions 
we also may need to rely on our credit facilities as described below under interest rate risk 
our access to our cash and cash equivalents or ability to borrow could be reduced if one or more financial institutions with which we have deposits or from which we borrow should fail or otherwise be adversely impacted by conditions in the financial or credit markets 
conditions such as those we experienced as a result of the economic downturn of and accompanying contraction in the credit markets heighten these risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global entity  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
adverse foreign currency rate movements could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases are in europe  asia  australia and canada 
we have many transactions denominated in foreign currencies and address certain of those financial exposures through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s country  and may hedge certain of these larger foreign currency transactions when they are not transacted in the subsidiaries functional currency or in us dollars 
the foreign currency sales transactions that fit our risk management policy criteria are hedged with forward contracts 
we may use other derivative instruments in the future 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the forward contracts range from one to thirteen months in maturity 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional amounts of forward contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
the fair value of forward contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
a move in foreign currency exchange rates would change the fair value of the contracts  and the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would change in a similar offsetting manner 

table of contents the notional values and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates of our sold and purchased foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at september  were as follows in millions notional value sold notional value purchased weighted average contract rate foreign currency units per usd australian dollar canadian dollar danish krone euro indian rupee japanese yen norwegian krone swiss franc totals interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates depends primarily on our investment portfolio and short term borrowings 
our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents and a short term investment as of september  the principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at september  totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of 
at september   our short term investment represented a loan of million to cptc  which bears interest at libor plus per annum with a minimum interest rate of per annum 
the credit facility allows us to borrow up to a maximum amount of million 
we collateralized a portion of the credit facility with a pledge of of the voting shares that we hold in varian medical systems nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary 
borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest based on i a eurodollar rate plus a margin or ii a base rate of the highest of a the federal funds rate plus  b bofa s announced prime rate or c the eurodollar rate plus  plus a margin 
in addition  the sumitomo credit facility allows vms kk to borrow up to a maximum amount of billion japanese yen 
borrowings under the sumitomo credit facility accrue interest based on the basic loan rate announced by the bank of japan plus a margin 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable under our credit facilities 
as of september   million was outstanding under our credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of 
if the amount outstanding under our credit facilities remained at this level for an entire year and interest rates increased or decreased due to changes in libor  the federal funds rate  bofa s prime rate or the bank of japan basic loan rate by  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  by an additional million 
see a detailed discussion of our credit facilities in item  md a liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  we had million of long term debt including the current maturities of long term debt outstanding at september  that carried at a weighted average fixed interest rate of with principal payments due in two years 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate of our investment portfolio  short term borrowings or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future

the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents of which was held abroad at september  and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the united states and the estimated fair value of our short term borrowings under our credit facilities approximated the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our loan to cptc was million at september   which was estimated based on the income approach by using the discounted cash flow model with key assumptions that include discount rates corresponding to the terms and risks associated with the loan to cptc 
in addition  the company does not increase the fair value above its par value as orix  the loan agent  has the option to purchase this loan from the company under the original terms and conditions at par value 
the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be million at september  the estimated fair value of long term debt was based on the then current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities and also took into consideration default and credit risk 
we determined the estimated fair value by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
