item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
the discussion and analysis for the fiscal years ended march   and as set forth below in this item should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of black box  including the related notes 
the company s fiscal year ends on march references to fiscal year or fiscal mean the company s fiscal year ended march for the year referenced 
all dollar amounts are presented in thousands except for per share amounts or unless otherwise noted 
the company black box is a leading communications system integrator dedicated to designing  sourcing  implementing and maintaining today s complex communications solutions 
the company s primary service offering is voice communications  the company also offers data infrastructure and technology products 
the company provides technical support for all its solutions  which encompass all major voice and data product manufacturers as well as an extensive range of technology products that it sells through its catalog and internet web site and its on site services offices 
as of march   the company had more than  professional technical experts in approximately offices serving more than  clients in approximately countries throughout the world 
founded in  black box operates subsidiaries on five continents and is headquartered near pittsburgh in lawrence  pennsylvania 
with respect to voice communications  the company s revenues are primarily generated from the sale and or installation of new voice communications systems  the maintenance of voice communications systems and moves  adds and changes mac work as clients employees change locations or as clients move or remodel their physical space 
the company s diverse portfolio of product offerings allows it to service the needs of its clients independent of the manufacturer that they choose  which it believes is a unique competitive advantage 
for the sale of new voice communications systems  most significant orders are subject to competitive bidding processes and  generally  competition can be significant for such new orders 
the company is continually bidding on new projects to replace projects that are completed 
new voice communications systems orders often generate an agreement to maintain the voice communications system  which generally ranges from years for commercial clients and years for government clients 
sales of new voice communications systems and  to a lesser extent  mac work  are dependent upon general economic growth and the company s clients capital spending 
on the other hand  revenues from maintenance contracts generally are not dependent on the economy as clients seek to extend the life of their existing equipment and delay capital spending on new voice communications systems 
the company also has government contracts that generate significant revenues and are not as dependent on the overall economic environment as commercial clients 
maintenance and mac work revenues are also dependent upon the company s history and relationship with its clients and its long track record of providing high quality service 
similarly  the company s revenues for data infrastructure are generated from the installation or upgrade of data networks and mac work 
the installation of new data networks is largely dependent upon commercial employment and building occupancy rates 
installed data networks  however  may need to be upgraded in order to provide for larger  faster networks to accommodate the growing use of network technology 
additionally  data infrastructure projects can include mac work  similar to voice communications  which is dependent on economic factors that are the same as those factors discussed above in relation to the voice communications business 
there is and has been a trend toward convergence of voice and data networks  in each of which the company has technical expertise which the company believes is a competitive advantage 
both the voice communications and data infrastructure businesses generate backlog 
at march   the company s backlog  defined as expected revenue related to executed client purchase orders or contracts that are estimated to be complete within days  was approximately  and relates primarily to voice communications and data infrastructure 
the company generates technology products revenues from the sale of technology products through its catalog  internet web site and the company s on site services offices 
the sale of these products is a highly fragmented and competitive business 
the company has been in this business for over years and has developed a reputation for providing high quality products  free technical support  comprehensive warranties and rapid order fulfillment 
with an average order size of less than one thousand dollars  the company s technology products is less impacted by capital spending and more so by general information technology spending 
the company s technology products business provides additional distribution and support capabilities along with access to black box branded products to both the voice communications and data infrastructure businesses which provide cost benefits 

table of contents the company services a variety of clients within most major industries  with the highest concentration in government  business services  manufacturing  banking  retail  healthcare and technology 
factors that impact those verticals  therefore  could have an impact on the company 
while the company generates most of its revenues in north america  the company also generates revenues from around the world  primarily europe  such that factors that impact european markets could impact the company 
management strives to develop extensive and long term relationships with high quality clients as management believes that satisfied clients will demand quality services and product offerings even in economic downturns

legal proceedings please see the matters discussed in part i  item  legal proceedings of this form k  which information is incorporated herein by reference 

table of contents critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance the company believes will be collected 
this allowance is based on both recent trends of certain accounts receivable specific reserve estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire accounts receivable pool general reserve 
the company computes a specific reserve by identifying specifically at risk accounts receivable and applying historic reserve factors to the outstanding balance 
the company computes a general reserve by reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying reserve factors based upon the age of the account receivable 
if the estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value and has been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records an estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventory reserve based upon product knowledge  physical inventory observation  future demand  market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the inventory reserve 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to events that impact the company s financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
deferred tax asset and liability balances are computed by identifying differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences which are multiplied by the current tax rate 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
if the company s estimate of the realizable deferred tax assets should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the deferred tax asset allowance 
goodwill the company conducts its annual goodwill impairment assessment during the third quarter of its fiscal year  using data as of the end of the second quarter of its fiscal year 
goodwill is tested using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill net book value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  thus the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment assessment  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  which is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the first step of the goodwill impairment assessment  the company uses an income approach to derive a present value of the reporting unit s projected future annual cash flows and the present residual value of the reporting unit 
the company uses the income approach because it believes that the discounted future cash flows provide greater detail and opportunity to reflect facts  circumstances and economic conditions for each reporting unit 
in addition  the company believes that this valuation approach is a proven valuation technique and methodology for its industry and is widely accepted by investors 
the company uses a variety of underlying assumptions to estimate these future cash flows  which vary for each of the reporting units and include i future revenue growth rates  ii future operating profitability  iii the weighted average cost of capital and iv a terminal growth rate 
if the company s estimates and assumptions used in the discounted future cash flows should change at some future date  the company could incur an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs 

table of contents in addition to estimating fair value of the company s reporting units using the income approach  the company also estimates fair value using a market based approach which relies on values based on market multiples derived from comparable public companies 
the company uses the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the market approach to validate the estimated fair value of the reporting units under the income approach 
beginning in and continuing through the present time  the company has pursued a strategy to expand its technical capabilities and geographic footprint to include data infrastructure and voice communications in north america and data infrastructure in europe by acquiring over one hundred companies that resulted in recording goodwill on its balance sheet 
the north america and europe reporting units continue to operate profitably and generate positive cash flow from operations  and the company expects that each will continue to do so in fiscal and beyond 
however  the fair value as of october   derived from a discounted cash flow model  of the north america and europe reporting units did not support the book value of goodwill recorded from those acquisitions 
the primary factors contributing to the difference in fair value to book value were an increased weighted average cost of capital for north america primarily driven by an increase in the risk premium associated with the company s industry segment relative to a control group and lower profitability as a result of competitive market conditions for both north america and europe 
as a result  as previously disclosed  the company  after consultation by management with the audit committee the audit committee of the board  recorded a non cash  pre tax goodwill impairment charge of  during the third quarter of fiscal as a result of its annual goodwill assessment conducted as of october  the impairment charge did not impact the company s business operations  compliance with debt covenants or future cash flows  or result in any cash expenditures 
in determining the impairment charge  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill was compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill was determined as the residual between the fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its assets including any unrecognized intangible assets and liabilities as of the annual goodwill assessment date 
at march   the company s stock market capitalization was comparable with net book value 
each of the company s reporting units continues to operate profitably and generate cash flow from operations  and the company expects that each will continue to do so in fiscal and beyond 
the company also believes that a reasonable potential buyer would offer a control premium for the business that would adequately cover any difference between the recent stock trading prices and the book value 
future events that could result in an interim assessment of goodwill impairment and or a potential impairment loss include  but are not limited to  i significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv a further decline in market capitalization below book value and v a modification to the company s operating segments 
management is currently considering alternative reporting segments for the purpose of making operational decisions and assessing financial performance 
this contemplated change in reporting segments would affect the reporting units currently being used in the company s annual goodwill impairment assessment 
any such change could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs 
long lived assets other than goodwill the company reviews long lived assets including property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
no impairments of long lived assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
loss contingencies the company incurs contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  such as future warranty obligations and potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters 
the company accrues for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business that include interest rate volatility and foreign currency exchange rates volatility 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
the company does not hold or issue any other financial derivative instruments other than those specifically noted below nor does it engage in speculative trading of financial derivatives 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its long term debt obligations 
as of march   the company had total long term obligations of  under the new credit agreement 
of the outstanding debt   was in variable rate debt that was effectively converted to a fixed rate through multiple interest rate swap agreements discussed in more detail below and  was in variable rate obligations 
as of march   an instantaneous basis point increase in the interest rate of the variable rate debt would reduce the company s net income loss in the subsequent fiscal year by net of tax assuming the company employed no intervention strategies 

table of contents to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain balance sheet liabilities so that the net interest margin is not  on a material basis  adversely affected by the movements in interest rates 
on may   the company entered into a five year floating to fixed interest rate swap  with an effective date of july   that is based on a month libor rate versus a fixed rate and has a notional value of  which reduced to  as of july  and terminated on july  
on june   the company entered into a three year floating to fixed interest rate swap  with an effective date of july   that is based on a month libor rate versus a fixed rate and has a notional value of  which reduced to  on july  
on may   the company entered into a one year floating to fixed interest rate swap  with an effective date of july   that is based on a month libor rate versus a fixed rate and has a notional value of  on november   the company entered into a three year floating to fixed interest rate swap  with an effective start date of july   that is based on a month libor rate versus a fixed rate and has a notional value of  as of march    of the total variable debt outstanding under the new credit agreement was effectively converted to a fixed rate through the interest rate swaps noted above 
the foregoing are sometimes referred to herein as the company s interest rate swaps 
changes in the fair market value of the company s interest rate swaps are recorded as an asset or liability within the company s consolidated balance sheets and interest expense income within the company s consolidated statements of operations 
foreign exchange rate risk the company has operations  clients and suppliers worldwide  thereby exposing the company s financial results to foreign currency fluctuations 
in an effort to reduce this risk of foreign currency fluctuations  the company generally sells and purchases inventory based on prices denominated in us dollars 
intercompany sales to subsidiaries are generally denominated in the subsidiaries local currency 
the company has entered and will continue in the future  on a selective basis  to enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions  primarily trade receivables and loans 
all of the foreign currency contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings 
once the forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings  the effective portion of any related gains or losses on the cash flow hedge is reclassified from aoci to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in the event it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  the ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge would be reclassified from aoci to the company s consolidated statements of operations 
as of march   the company had open foreign currency contracts in australian and canadian dollars  danish krone  euros  mexican pesos  norwegian kroner  british pounds sterling  swedish krona  swiss francs and japanese yen
