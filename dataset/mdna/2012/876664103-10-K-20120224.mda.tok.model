the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc tco is a michigan corporation that operates as a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg is a majority owned partnership subsidiary of tco  which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties 
in this report  the terms we  us  and our refer to tco  the operating partnership  and or the operating partnership s subsidiaries as the context may require 
we own  manage  lease  acquire  dispose of  develop  and expand regional and super regional shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements  the taubman company llc manager  and taubman properties asia llc and its subsidiaries taubman asia 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
the comparability of information used in measuring performance is affected by the dispositions of the pier shops at caesars the pier shops and regency square and the acquisitions of the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village in all statistics exclude the pier shops and regency square 
the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village are excluded from statistics except for ending occupancy and leased space 
comparable center amounts are provided for statistics presented as of december  comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for two years 
see results of operations dispositions discontinued operations  results of operations acquisitions and discontinued operations of the pier shops and regency square reconciliations of net operating income to net loss for background and information on operations of these centers 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term of new leases at approximately eight years during and approximately seven years during  excluding temporary leases 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
our tenant sales continue to be strong and the momentum that gained strength throughout clearly continued throughout tenant sales per square foot were in  a increase from  and the highest we have ever reported 
we are estimating tenant sales per square foot to be up to in see mall tenant sales and center revenues 

table of contents ending occupancy was for comparable centers at december   up from we anticipate occupancy will be up on average about throughout rent per square foot increased in we expect that average rents per square foot in will be up in comparison to by approximately 
the rents we are able to achieve are affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels  and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations and we provide information about transactions that affected the periods presented or will affect operations in the future 
we made substantial progress on our external growth initiatives and completed the purchases of the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village and taubman tcbl in china in see results of operations acquisitions 
dispositions of the pier shops and regency square were completed in november and december of  respectively 
titles to the properties were transferred to the mortgage lenders 
as a result  we have been relieved of our million of debt obligations plus accrued interest associated with the properties 
see results of operations dispositions discontinued operations for further discussion 
we also describe the current status of our efforts to broaden our growth in asia in see results of operations taubman asia 
we continue to see signs of an economic recovery and have seen improvement in our center operations in see results of operations center operations 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenue from management  leasing  and development services 
we disclose our share of these sources of income under results of operations other income 
we have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing refinancings of international plaza  fair oaks and our revolving credit facility in as outlined under results of operations debt transactions 
in addition to the issuance of million operating partnership units in connection with the acquisitions of the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village  we also completed other equity transactions in we redeemed the operating partnership s series f preferred equity and completed an equity offering of million common shares see results of operations other equity transactions 
as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo under results of operations use of non gaap measures 
with all the preceding information as background  we then provide insight and explanations for variances in our financial results for   and under comparison of to and comparison of to we then discuss our application of critical accounting policies and then provide reconciliations from net income loss and net income loss allocable to common shareowners to our non gaap measures 
our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of current market conditions and our financial position as of december  in july  the million refinancing of the fair oaks loan  million at our share  was completed 
in november  the refinancing of the million international plaza loan  million at our share  was completed 
in  we refinanced our primary line of credit  which extended the maturity date to january with a one year extension option  and our second line of credit s maturity was extended to april the new primary line of credit increased the borrowing capacity to million from million 
we then discuss our capital activities and transactions that occurred in after that  analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is provided in more detail 
specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under liquidity and capital resources beneficial interest in debt

property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees and liquidity and capital resources cash tender agreement and other are our significant guarantees and commitments

we also provide information on our capital spending in and  as well as planned capital spending for we provide information on certain new center projects that are in the final pre development phase see liquidity capital spending 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under liquidity and capital resources dividends 
mall tenant sales and center revenues we have now had eight consecutive quarters of double digit mall tenant sales per square foot growth and in the fourth quarter of  tenant sales increased by compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
for all of  our tenant sales increased over to a new record level for our centers of per square foot 
we estimate tenant sales to be up to in over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs  and may be impacted significantly  either positively or negatively  by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as tenant sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of tenant sales at higher sales per square foot 
tenant sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in tenant sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent of total rents approximately in 
while tenant sales are critical over the long term  the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants  its staggered lease maturities  and high proportion of fixed rent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates

rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
generally  center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average rent per square foot statistics reflect the contractual rental terms of the lease currently in effect and include the impact of rental concessions 
in periods of increasing sales  as we are experiencing now  rents on new leases will generally tend to rise 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason  as tenants expectations of future growth become less optimistic 
average rent per square foot in is expected to be up about

table of contents seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school period 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income may vary significantly from quarter to quarter

because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries as a percentage of sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter

table of contents results of operations in addition to the results and trends in our operations discussed in the preceding sections  the following sections discuss certain transactions that affected operations in the years ending   and  or are expected to affect operations in the future 
acquisitions in december  we acquired the mall at green hills in nashville  tennessee  and the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village in palm desert  california from affiliates of davis street properties  llc 
the consideration for the properties was million  excluding transaction costs 
the consideration consisted of the assumption of million of debt  million in installment notes  and the issuance of million of operating partnership units 
the assumed debt consists of three loans see note notes payable for detail on these loans 
the number of partnership units issued was determined based on a value of per unit 
the partnership units will become eligible to be converted into common shares after one year 
prior to this date  holders have the ability to put the units back to us at the lesser of the current market price of taubman centers common stock or per share 
the installment notes were secured by letters of credit  which were funded by borrowings under our line of credit  and were paid off in february see note acquisitions and dispositions for a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of acquisition 
based on consideration of million and estimates of the properties combined net operating income noi in  the capitalization rate on the acquisition is about 
the tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of tenant sales of these centers average below  significantly less than the occupancy costs of our portfolio 
we believe there is an opportunity to substantially increase the noi of the properties over time 
actual noi results may vary considerably from the original estimates 
while it will be difficult to significantly impact noi before  today s low interest rate environment is expected to make these acquisitions about neutral to funds from operations ffo per share in  excluding million in positive adjustments for purchase accounting 
the impact of these centers on net income in will also include approximately million of depreciation and amortization

substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill in taubman tcbl 
taubman asia will fund any additional capital required by the business and will receive a preferred return on all capital contributed 
the ownership agreements provide for the distribution of preferred returns on capital as well as returns of all such capital prior to the sharing of profits on relative ownership interests 
we have not yet finalized our allocations of the purchase prices to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
we are awaiting certain valuation information for assets and liabilities acquired to complete our allocations 
a final determination of the required purchase price allocations will be made during during  acquisition costs of million were incurred in connection with the above transactions 
these costs have been separately presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income 
dispositions discontinued operations in december  the mortgage lender for regency square accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure on the property 
as a result  title to the property was transferred to the mortgage lender  and we have been relieved of the million of debt obligations plus accrued interest

the potential return of the investment  including a return on the investment  is secured by a letter of credit from shinsegae 
in september  we entered into agreements to provide development  leasing and management services for ifc mall in yeouido  seoul  south korea 
currently under construction  the approximate  square foot mall will feature over retailers 
in  we recognized the first installment of the leasing success fee for our progress at ifc mall and expect to recognize the second installment of the fee in the project is over leased and is expected to open in the third quarter of center operations for the year ended december   noi excluding lease cancellation income was up from we estimate that noi of our comparable centers  excluding lease cancellation income  will be up in the range of to in we expect increased tenant rents resulting from higher average rent per square foot and improved occupancy 
see results of operations use of non gaap measures for the definition and discussion of noi and see reconciliation of net income loss to net operating income 
other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
shopping center related revenues include parking  sponsorship  and other income 
lease cancellation revenue is primarily dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with potential purchasers of land  as well as the economy and the timing of the transactions 
during the year ended december   we recognized our approximately million share of lease cancellation revenue from continuing operations 
in  lease cancellation income was high primarily due to two large payments 
our share of lease cancellation income from continuing operations over the last five years ranged from this year s million to last year s million from continuing operations 
in  we are currently estimating our share of lease cancellation income to be about million to million

borrowings under trg s revolving credit facility are primary obligations of the entities owning dolphin mall  fairlane town center  and twelve oaks mall  which are collateral for the line of credit 
the operating partnership and the entities owning fairlane and twelve oaks guarantee amounts under the credit agreement up to the million facility  while the entity owning dolphin guarantees amounts up to its sublimit  which is currently million 
in december  we assumed million of debt in relation to the acquisition of the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village see results of operations acquisitions 
other equity transactions in october  we redeemed the operating partnership s series f preferred equity for million  which represented a million discount from the book value 
the million excess of the book value over the redemption amount was reflected as a reduction in earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interests in in june  we sold  of our common shares 
the proceeds were used to acquire an equal number of operating partnership units 
the operating partnership paid all offering costs 
the operating partnership used the net proceeds  after offering costs  of million to reduce outstanding borrowings under our lines of credit 

table of contents litigation charges in  we recognized litigation charges relating to the settlement of two lawsuits related to westfarms  our center in west hartford  connecticut 
the settlements included million settled in december and million settled in january  of which our share of the total settlements was million 
see note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures westfarms to our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring in  in response to the decreased level of active projects due to the downturn in the economy  we reduced our workforce by about positions  primarily in areas that directly or indirectly affected our development initiatives in the us and asia 
the restructuring charge was million  and primarily represented the cost of terminations of personnel 
use of non gaap measures we use noi as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers  both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases 
we define noi as property level operating revenues includes rental income excluding straight line adjustments of minimum rent less maintenance  taxes  utilities  promotion  ground rent including straight line adjustments  and other property operating expenses 
since noi excludes general and administrative expenses  pre development charges  interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  restructuring charges and gains from land and property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared period over period  reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties  as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales  occupancy and rental rates  and operating costs 
we also use noi excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period  which can affect comparability and trend analysis 
for our stabilized portfolio basis  we generally provide separate projections for expected noi growth and our lease cancellation income 
the operating results in the following table include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents our share of the earnings before interest  income taxes and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
in  nareit clarified the definition to also exclude impairment write downs of depreciable real estate 
consequently  we have restated ffo  which previously included impairment charges for the pier shops and regency square  to be consistent with the clarified definition 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring operating performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
we may also present adjusted versions of noi  beneficial interest in ebitda  and ffo when used by management to evaluate our operating performance when certain significant items have impacted our results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items 
in  ffo was adjusted for the gains on extinguishment of debt related to the disposition of the pier shops and regency square  acquisition costs related to the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village and taubman tcbl  and our redemption of the operating partnership s series f preferred equity 
in  ffo was adjusted for a restructuring charge and litigation charges 
ffo was not adjusted in our presentations of noi  beneficial interest in ebitda  ffo  and adjusted versions of these measures  are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income loss or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  these measures do not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reconciliations of net income loss attributable to taubman centers  inc common shareowners to funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations  net income loss to beneficial interest in ebitda  and net income loss to net operating income loss are presented following application of critical accounting policies

percentage rents increased due to higher tenant sales 
expense recoveries increased primarily due to an increase in certain recoverable expenses and an increase in fixed cam revenue 
management  leasing  and development revenue increased by million to million due to an incentive fee recognized in for our leasing progress at ifc mall  seoul  south korea  along with a one time collection of past due development fees for services provided in previous years on the riverstone project in songdo international business district  incheon  south korea 
we expect net management leasing and development income to be in the range of million to million in we expect a reduction in domestic fee revenue with city creek center opening in march in asia  while we are anticipating another leasing success fee relating to ifc mall in  net third party income is expected to decrease due to the opening of the center and expected losses at taubman tcbl 
other income decreased primarily due to lower lease cancellation income 
total expenses were million  a million or decrease from maintenance  taxes  utilities and promotion expense increased primarily due to increased maintenance costs and marketing and promotion expenses  partially offset by decreased property taxes at certain centers

general and administrative expense increased primarily due to increases in travel and compensation expenses 
in  we incurred million in costs related to the acquisitions of tcbl and the mall at green hills and the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village see results of operations acquisitions 
interest expense decreased primarily due to the change in interest rate on the international plaza loan to a floating rate during the period the loan was extended 
depreciation expense was high in primarily due to changes in depreciable lives of tenant allowances in connection with early terminations 
depreciation in was also impacted by shortened useful lives of certain assets at one center as part of a construction project to build a new theater 
nonoperating income decreased by million in there were million of gains on land sales in  compared to million in we are not projecting any land sale transactions to occur in unconsolidated joint ventures total revenues for the year ended december  were million  a million or decrease from percentage rents increased due to higher tenant sales 
expense recoveries decreased primarily due to lower expenses and adjustments from prior estimated recoveries at certain centers 
other income decreased primarily due to lower lease cancellation income 
total expenses decreased by million or  to million for the year ended december  maintenance  taxes  utilities  and promotion expenses decreased primarily due to decreased property taxes and reduced maintenance costs at certain centers

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers the viability of all projects under construction or development  including those owned by unconsolidated joint ventures  are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
additionally  all properties are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities is recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income 
no impairment charges were recognized in and in  we recognized impairment charges of million and million related to the pier shops and regency square  respectively see results of operations dispositions discontinued operations 
as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see results of operations use of non gaap measures 
on an ongoing basis  we continue to assess the probability of a project going forward and whether the asset is impaired 
in addition  we also assess whether there are sufficient substantive development activities in a given period to support the capitalization of carrying costs  including interest capitalization 
direct and indirect costs that are clearly related to the acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
compensation costs are allocated based on actual time spent on a project 
costs incurred on real estate for ground leases  property taxes  insurance  and interest costs for qualifying assets are capitalized during periods in which activities necessary to get the property ready for its intended use are in progress 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 

table of contents our million balance of capitalized development pre construction costs as of december  consists primarily of approximately million of land and site improvements relating to our oyster bay project 
the balance also includes land for future development in atlanta  georgia 
pre development charges in   and were million  million and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million and million related to projects with land under option in each of the respective periods 
valuation of accounts and notes receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent approximately of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
notes receivable at december  totaled million 
valuation of the recoverability of notes receivable is dependent on management s estimates of the collectibility of contractual principal and interest payments  which are inherently judgmental 
valuation of deferred tax assets we currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation  net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings 
expected future taxable earnings require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company s profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
as of december   we had a net federal  state and foreign deferred tax asset of million  after a valuation allowance of million 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned unless it was already consolidated  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important for the recording of the acquisition at fair value  and allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
in  we acquired the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village 
see note acquisitions and dispositions for the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the dates of acquisition 
in  we also acquired a controlling interest in a beijing based retail real estate consultancy company and substantially all of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill in taubman tcbl 
we have not yet finalized our allocations of the purchase prices to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired 
we are awaiting certain valuation information for assets and liabilities acquired to complete our allocations 
a final determination of required purchase price allocations will be made during

these estimates for planned capital spending do not include any amounts for the three centers expected to begin construction in we will update our planned capital spending when the projects budgets are finalized and timing of expenditures are determined 
in addition  estimates of capital spending will change as new projects are approved by our board of directors 
disclosures regarding planned capital spending  including estimates regarding timing of openings  capital expenditures  occupancy  and returns on new developments are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with anchors  tenants  and contractors  timing and outcome of litigation and entitlement processes  changes in the scope  number  and valuation of projects  cost overruns  timing of expenditures  availability of and cost of financing and other financing considerations  actual time to start construction and complete projects  changes in economic climate  competition from others attracting tenants and customers  increases in operating costs  timing of tenant openings  and early lease terminations and bankruptcies 
dividends we pay regular quarterly dividends to our common and preferred shareowners 
dividends to our common shareowners are at the discretion of the board of directors and depend on the cash available to us  our financial condition  capital and other requirements  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute at least of our reit taxable income prior to net capital gains to our shareowners  as well as meet certain other requirements 
we must pay these distributions in the taxable year the income is recognized  or in the following taxable year if they are declared during the last three months of the taxable year  payable to shareowners of record on a specified date during such period and paid during january of the following year 
such distributions are treated as paid by us and received by our shareowners on december of the year in which they are declared 
in addition  at our election  a distribution for a taxable year may be declared in the following taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
these distributions qualify as dividends paid for the reit distribution test for the previous year and are taxable to holders of our capital stock in the year in which paid 
preferred dividends accrue regardless of whether earnings  cash availability  or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends
