item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we make statements in this section that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
for a complete discussion of forward looking statements  see the section in this form k entitled forward looking statements 
certain risk factors may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion 
for a discussion of such risk factors  see the section in this report entitled risk factors 
when you read the financial statements and the information included in this report  you should be aware that our operations are significantly affected by both macro and micro economic forces 
our operations are directly affected by actual and perceived trends in various national and regional economic conditions that affect national and regional markets for commercial real estate services  including interest rates  the availability of credit to finance commercial real estate transactions  and the impact of tax laws affecting real estate 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  tightening of the credit markets  declining demand for or increased supply of real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur can adversely affect our business 
these conditions could result in a general decline in rents  which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from leases 
in addition  these conditions could lead to a decline in property values as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets  which in turn may reduce revenues from investment advisory  property management  leasing and development fees 
overview and background we are a full service real estate operating company that owns  acquires  develops and manages primarily office  as well as mixed use and residential properties on a nationwide basis 
our company s primary areas of focus are the acquisition and ownership of interests in premier properties  property development and redevelopment  and investment and property management activities 
we conduct our business through our operating partnership  of which we own as of december  and have control over the major decisions of the operating partnership 
the properties we own interests in or manage on behalf of third parties are located in southern california and sacramento  california  philadelphia  pennsylvania  northern virginia  houston  texas  and austin  texas

we also have a direct and indirect ownership interest in a development pipeline of approximately million square feet of primarily office development 
additionally  we developed murano  a unit high rise residential condominium project in downtown philadelphia  in which we have closed sales on units as of december  dispositions three primary objectives of our strategic plan are selling non core assets that have achieved their maximum value  reducing the size of our development portfolio as a percentage of our total portfolio value and continuing to reduce leverage on our portfolio 
during the year ended december  and subsequent to year end  we were able to advance the achievement of these objectives through targeted dispositions 
during the year ended december   we closed on the sales of citywest and two adjacent land parcels  and centerpointe i ii  each a tpg calstrs joint venture office property  which sales resulted in gains to tpg of million and million  respectively  and tpg s share of net proceeds was million and million  respectively

subsequent to december   we closed on the sale of brookhollow central i  ii and iii  a tpg calstrs joint venture property  of which tpg s share of net proceeds was million  and we recorded an impairment charge related to brookhollow central i  ii and iii in to reduce the book value to the net sales proceeds of which our share was million 
additionally  in january  we closed on the sale of a  square foot retail building at four points centre  which resulted in net proceeds to us of million 
in october  a foreclosure sale  by stipulation with the lender  occurred whereby tpg calstrs was relieved of the obligation to pay the remaining debt and is no longer the owner of oak hill plaza  walnut hill plaza and four falls corporate center in suburban philadelphia 
tpg s share of the gain on extinguishment of debt was million 
as a result of the property dispositions mentioned in the previous paragraphs  and summarized in the table below in thousands  tpg s share of net proceeds was approximately million and tpg s share of mortgage debt was reduced by approximately million 
our plan is to redeploy net sales proceeds by acquiring institutional quality assets in high barrier to entry markets to generate recurring cash flow and net operating income growth

the loan bears interest at the one month london inter bank offered rate libor plus and matures on december  the new mortgage loan refinances the prior construction loan that had an outstanding balance of million  was scheduled to mature on july   and carried an interest rate of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting estimates  as these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
we believe the following accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents investments in real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments related to our estimates of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these estimates have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to record more value to the buildings as opposed to recording the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts recorded to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts recorded to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to non market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we evaluate a property for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current book value of the property may not be recoverable 
indicators of potential impairment include among other things declining occupancy levels  declining rental rates  increasing number of tenants unable to pay their rent  deterioration in the local rental market  declining market values  and our inability or change of intent to hold the property 
in the event that these periodic assessments result in a determination that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
these estimates are highly subjective and require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property or inability to sell the property  holding periods  market conditions  accessibility of capital and credit markets  recent sales activity of similar properties in the same market  our liquidity and ability and intent to hold the properties  development and construction costs  and discount rates 
these estimates can change significantly between reporting periods 
due to the fact that estimates included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions may lead to additional impairment charges in the future that cannot be anticipated 
we use the equity method of accounting to account for investments in real estate entities over which we have significant influence  but not control over major decisions 
in these situations  the unit of account for measurement purposes is the equity investment and not the real estate 
accordingly  if our joint venture investments meet the other than temporary criteria of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  investments equity method and joint ventures asc  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of our investment 
with respect to condominium units held for sale  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell the project 
estimates of fair value are often based on expected future net cash flows  which are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the project 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  sales absorption rates  selling prices and discount rates 
refer to the impairment loss discussion in the sections titled comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  found elsewhere herein for further information on the impairment losses recorded in those years 
revenue recognition 
leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
rental income is recognized as earned based upon the contractual terms of the leases with tenants 
minimum annual rents are recognized on a straight line basis over 
table of contents the lease term regardless of when the payments are made 
the deferred rents asset on our balance sheets represents the aggregate excess rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the cash received under the applicable lease provisions 
our leases generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate related taxes associated with the property 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenues in the period the related expenses are incurred 
we generally record income on real estate commissions on leases after we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement 
a typical commission agreement provides that we earn of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant 
the remaining of the lease commission is earned at a later date  usually upon tenant occupancy 
the existence of any significant future contingencies will delay recognition of commission revenue until those contingencies are satisfied 
in addition  we eliminate lease commissions we charge on our ownership share of rental properties 
investment advisory  property management and development services fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements 
we have one high rise condominium project for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize costs and sales during the construction period  up through and including june  commencing with the third quarter of  we have applied the deposit method of accounting to recognize sales revenue and costs 
under the provisions of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsection real estate and sales  revenue and costs for projects are recognized when all parties are bound by the terms of the contract  all consideration has been exchanged  any permanent financing for which the seller is responsible has been arranged and all conditions precedent to closing have been performed 
this results in profit from the sale of condominium units recognized at the point of settlement as compared to the point of sale 
revenue is recognized on the contract price of individual units 
total estimated costs  net of impairment charges  are allocated to individual units which have closed on a relative value basis 
total estimated revenue and construction costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 
allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rents receivable 
tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for estimated uncollectible tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent 
our determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
unbilled deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental revenue recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreements 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
we evaluate the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for our company s significant tenants  assessing a tenant s financial condition and the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve based upon our historical experience and current and anticipated future economic conditions that are not associated with any specific tenant 
depreciable lives of leasing costs 
we incur certain capital costs in connection with leasing our properties 
these costs consist primarily of lease commissions and tenant improvements 
lease costs are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the estimated remaining term of the lease  ranging from one to years 
we reevaluate the remaining useful life of these costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants changes 
if we determine that the estimated remaining life of the respective lease has changed  we adjust the amortization period and  therefore  the amortization or depreciation expense recorded each period may fluctuate 
if we experience increased levels of amortization or depreciation expense due to changes in the estimated useful lives of leasing costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states  and also in states and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to fasb asc  income taxes asc 
asc requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position would more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
asc provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
asc also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 

table of contents factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a summary of the more significant factors we believe may affect our results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion regarding the factors that you should consider before making a decision to acquire shares of our common stock  see the information under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this report 
rental income 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space  to lease currently available space as well as space in newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in the submarkets where our properties are located 
los angeles  philadelphia  austin  and houston submarket information 
a significant portion of our income is derived from properties located in los angeles  philadelphia  austin and houston 
the market conditions in these submarkets have a significant impact on our results of operations 
development and redevelopment activities 
we continually evaluate the size  timing and scope of our development and redevelopment initiatives and  as necessary  sales activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets 
however  we may not be able to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected time frames or complete projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we own interests in three development projects  campus el segundo  four points centre and jfk boulevard 
our joint venture with calstrs includes one potential development site  citywestplace  which is comprised of acres 
as of december   we had incurred  on a consolidated basis  approximately million of costs related to land acquisition  predevelopment and infrastructure that are reflected in land improvements development properties on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we  or joint ventures we are a partner in  do not proceed with projects as planned  development and or redevelopment costs would need to be evaluated for impairment

comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  overview the main drivers of our consolidated results of operations are two high rise office towers  commonly referred to as commerce square  located in philadelphia  pennsylvania  murano  a high rise condominium project  also located in philadelphia  and our investment advisory  management  leasing and development services business

revenues total revenues decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the sale of condominium units for the year ended december  compared to the sale of condominium units for the same period in the prior year  which resulted in a decrease of million of revenue from condominium sales 
this revenue decrease was partially offset by a million increase in tenant reimbursements related to a significant tenant at commerce square which transitioned from a gross lease to a net lease as well as a new significant tenant also at commerce square 
additionally  there was an increase of million in revenues from our investment advisory business  primarily as a result of a deferred incentive fee payment related to the sale of valencia town center  a managed property 
finally  our reduced ownership interests in city national plaza and 
table of contents centerpointe i ii allowed us to recognize greater fee revenue from these properties 
expenses total expenses decreased by approximately million primarily as a result of the decrease in condominium unit sales  partially offset by an increase in asset impairment charges

the decrease was due to an accelerated marketing program we entered into in for the sale of lower priced units  we sold units through this marketing program 
we did not have a similar marketing program for the year ended december  additionally  there was a million decrease in tenant reimbursements related to a scheduled expiration in june of a significant lease conrail at two commerce square representing approximately  rentable square feet  offset by a decrease in refunds to tenants in as compared to related to their share of operating expenses 
expenses total expenses decreased by approximately million primarily as a result of the decrease in condominium unit sales expense  interest expense  general and administrative expenses  and asset impairment charges 
condominium unit sale expenses decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   see previous paragraph 
the decrease in interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the payoff of mezzanine debt at two commerce square in december  which resulted in a decrease of million in interest expense compared to the prior period 
interest expense also decreased at our murano and four points centre properties as a result of payments made which lowered the principal balances of the related mortgage loans 
general and administrative expense decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to a reduction in compensation expense as a result of cost saving measures 
we recognized an impairment charge related to our murano condominium project for the year ended december  that was million lower than the impairment recognized in the prior year 
the book carrying value of murano  net of the impairment charges  is reflective of the company s estimation of future absorption rates and sales prices  which are supported by a third party appraisal 
if the actual absorption and sales prices are materially less than the projection  we could potentially need to record additional impairment in future periods

in november  our board of directors reinstituted a quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders by declaring a dividend payable in december  of per common share 
quarterly cash dividends had previously been suspended since december the availability of funds to pay dividends is impacted by property level restrictions on cash flows 
with respect to our joint venture properties  we do not solely control decision making with respect to these properties  and may not be able to obtain monies from these properties even if funds are available for distribution to us 
in addition  we may enter future financing arrangements that contain restrictions on our use of cash generated from our properties 
the payment of cash dividends in the future  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as earnings levels  capital requirements  our overall financial condition  and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
development we own interests in three development projects  campus el segundo  four points centre and jfk boulevard 
tpg calstrs owns one potential development site  citywestplace  which is comprised of acres 
if we decide to develop any of these land holdings  we anticipate seeking to mitigate our development risk by obtaining significant pre leasing and guaranteed maximum cost construction contracts 
the amount and timing of costs associated with our development projects is inherently uncertain due to market and economic conditions 
we presently intend to fund development expenditures primarily through construction and permanent financing 
leasing  tenant improvement and capital needs in addition to our development projects  our one commerce square and two commerce square properties require capital maintenance and expenditures for leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs 
the level of these expenditures varies from year to year based on several factors  including lease expirations 
there are commitments to incur expenditures of approximately million in capital improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing commissions for commerce square collectively  during through additionally  we expect to expend additional amounts in connection with a value enhancement program at commerce square 
the funding for the million of existing commitments and future expenditures under the value enhancement program are discussed in the paragraph below 
during november  subsidiaries of tpg and brandywine entered into two partnership arrangements with respect to our one commerce square and two commerce square properties 
brandywine has contributed capital of million as of december   with the balance to be contributed by december   totaling million of preferred equity in return for a limited partnership interest in each property

inflation substantially all of our office leases provide for tenants to reimburse us for increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses related to the leased space at the applicable property 
in addition  many of the leases provide for increases in fixed base rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense reimbursements as described above 
we have one multi family residential rental property  which is located in the philadelphia central business district and subject to short term leases 
inflationary increases can often be offset by increased rental rates  however  a weak economic environment may restrict our ability to raise rental rates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk faced by our company is interest rate risk 
our strategy is to match as closely as possible the expected holding periods and income streams of our assets with the terms of our debt 
in general  we use floating rate debt on assets with higher growth prospects and less stability to their income streams 
correspondingly  with respect to stabilized assets with lower growth rates  we will generally use longer term fixed rate debt 
as of december   our company had million of outstanding consolidated floating rate debt  which is not subject to an interest rate cap 
our fixed and variable rate consolidated long term debt at december  consisted of the following in thousands year of maturity fixed rate variable rate total thereafter total weighted average interest rate we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on interest costs of our variable rate debt 
at december   our variable rate long term debt represents of our total long term debt 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  or by approximately of the weighted average variable rate at december   the net impact would be increased interest costs of million per year 
our estimates of the fair value of debt instruments at december  and  respectively  were determined by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop the estimated fair value 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
as of december  and  the estimated fair value of our mortgage and other secured loans and unsecured loan aggregates million and million  respectively  compared to the aggregate carrying value of million and million  respectively
