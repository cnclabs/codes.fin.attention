item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this document 
overview of our business we are the service leader in cloud computing 
our growth is the result of our commitment to serving our customers  known as fanatical support  and our exclusive focus on cloud computing 
we have been successful in attracting and retaining thousands of customers and in growing our business 
we are a pioneer in an emerging category  hybrid hosting  which combines the benefits of hosted computing on dedicated hardware and on pools of shared resources 
we are committed to maintaining our service centric focus  and we will follow our vision to be considered one of the world s great service companies 
we offer a portfolio of cloud computing services  including dedicated cloud hosting and public cloud hosting 
the equipment required servers  routers  switches  firewalls  load balancers  cabinets  software  wiring  etc 
to deliver services is typically purchased and managed by us 
we sell our services to small and medium sized businesses as well as large enterprises 
during  of our net revenue was generated by our operations outside of the us  mainly from the us additionally  we operate a hong kong data center and sales office 
our growth strategy includes  among other strategies  targeting international customers as we plan to expand our activities in continental europe and asia 
during  no individual customer accounted for more than of our net revenue 
how we earn revenue and measure growth our subscription based business model generates approximately of our revenue on a recurring basis 
our customers pay us a recurring fee based on the size and complexity of the it systems we manage and the level of service intensity we provide  pursuant to service agreements that typically provide for monthly payments 
our public cloud service offers pay as you go services that are earned and recognized as recurring revenue as the services are provided 
revenue is reduced by credits issued to customers  primarily for service interruptions  and also includes revenue related to customers who have canceled their service 
net revenue for the years ended december   and was million  million and  million  respectively  representing year over year increases of in and in our revenue growth is primarily due to the increased volume of services provided  both because of an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers  as well as a broader suite of cloud computing services acquired through acquisitions and research and development activities 
installed base growth is a metric we use to measure the growth of revenue derived only from our existing customer base 
our net revenue is denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies  including the pound sterling  the euro  and the hong kong dollar 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our net revenue 
the increase in net revenue due to foreign currency fluctuations was approximately million  or  in 
table of contents nature of our operating expenses our operating expense categories include cost of revenue  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses  and we expect this to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  non equity incentive compensation  vacation  benefits  and share based compensation 
employee non equity incentive compensation through our current non equity incentive plan  in effect since january   is dependent upon the financial results of the company in relation to a pre set target level that is set at the beginning of each quarter 
thus  favorable financial performance in comparison to the pre set target level is partially offset by increased non equity incentive compensation expense 
if company achievement of the pre set target results in a increase in the non equity incentive compensation percentage payout in a quarter  this would increase total non equity incentive compensation by approximately million on an after tax basis and increase net income by million in that quarter 
company achievement resulting in a decrease in the non equity incentive compensation percentage payout in a quarter would decrease total non equity incentive compensation by approximately million on an after tax basis and decrease net income by million in that quarter 
additionally  the compensation committee has the discretion to increase or decrease a payout under the plan at any time in the event that it determines that circumstances warrant adjustment or to pay bonuses outside of the plan 
we had  and  employees as of december  and  respectively 
the year over year increase was primarily attributable to increases in our customer and data center support teams  as well as increases in general and administrative positions 
to maintain our service focus  our support teams have continued to grow with the growth of our business 
our headcount is expected to increase in as we continue to grow our business 
cost of revenue primarily consists of employee related costs of our customer support teams and data center employees  as well as the costs to operate our data centers 
the majority of our data center costs vary with the volume of services sold and include power  bandwidth  and rent  costs associated with licenses  and costs related to maintenance and the replacement of it equipment components 
our contracts with network operators for bandwidth capacity generally commit us to pay a monthly fee based on usage 
our data centers rely on local and regional utility companies as their primary source of power 
we have fixed price power arrangements with the electricity providers of our grapevine  texas and slough  uk data centers that expire in september we enter into contracts with software providers that allow us to provide licenses to our customers 
our arrangements with these software vendors are typically one to three years in length and we generally pay a fixed fee per license 
sales and marketing activities are directed toward both the acquisition of new customers and increasing our business with existing customers 
we pay commissions to our sales representatives generally upon execution of a service agreement 
sales and marketing expense also includes compensation to our channel partners 
marketing expenditures are intended to communicate the advantages of our services and to generate customer demand 
the majority of our marketing expenditures relate to lead generation through pay per click placements on major internet search engines 
general and administrative activities are comprised of employee related costs  professional fees  general corporate costs and overhead 
while we continue to invest in our administrative infrastructure and personnel to support our growth  our focus has been and continues to be on scaling these administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization expense includes amortization of leasehold improvements associated with our data centers and corporate facilities  as well as depreciation of our data center infrastructure and equipment 
amortization expense is also comprised of the amortization of our customer based intangible assets related to acquisitions  internally developed technology  and software licenses purchased from third party vendors 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies  including the pound sterling  the euro  and hong kong dollar 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results 
the increase in operating expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations  was approximately million  or less than  in 
table of contents capital expenditures our capital expenditures primarily relate to customer gear  data center infrastructure  corporate office build outs  and internally developed software and other projects 
each category is defined below customer gear includes servers  firewalls  load balancers  cabinets  switches  backup libraries  storage arrays and drives and network cabling 
data center infrastructure includes generators  uninterruptible power supplies or ups  power distribution units  mechanical and electrical plants  chillers  raised floor and other building improvements 
corporate office build outs includes demolition  raised floor  furniture and general building improvements 
internally developed software and other includes salaries and payroll related costs of employees and consultants who devote time to the development of certain internal use software projects  and other projects that meet the criteria for capitalization 
in  we expended cash or entered into lease arrangements for the purchase of customer gear of million and incurred data center infrastructure costs of million  corporate office build out costs of million and million of costs related to internally developed software and other capitalized projects 
our data center infrastructure is built to accommodate future revenue growth 
while we try to minimize the amount of excess capacity  we consider appropriate lead times for these build outs  which requires us to build capacity ahead of actual revenue growth 
we also strive to align our investment in data center infrastructure with our revenue growth to keep utilization rates high 
we measure our utilization rate as the power being consumed by all electrical equipment relative to the total available capacity in our data centers excluding portions of the data center that have not been placed on line 
we pursue a modular build out strategy within our data centers that expands the operational footprint when needed 
from time to time  we will be required to make significant investments in new data centers or enter into long term facility leases to support expected growth beyond our ability to build out additional modules in existing facilities 
while many factors may influence our margins  in periods when we make large investments  margins may decrease 
such investments may be made in connection with data center and office expansion  as well as significant product and market development initiatives 
during  we continued to add to our existing data center footprint both in the us and internationally to support our growth 
we added more than thousand technical square feet of data center space 
in february and august  we modified our operating lease agreement with a subsidiary of dupont fabros technology to lease additional space at our chicago area data center 
in december  we entered into an operating lease agreement with digital realty trust to lease approximately  technical square feet of data center space in richardson  texas 
this current strategy of entering into operating lease agreements for data center space reduces the capital investments required to increase our data center square footage 

table of contents disciplined use of capital and management of profitability we have achieved net income profitability since the first quarter of through focused management of capital and profitability 
we use the economic value added model eva  which was developed by stern stewart co  as a tool to help ensure our growth and capital investments create stockholder value 
virtually all capital expenditures are evaluated against this metric using a standard cost of capital 
eva is calculated for our product offerings to evaluate our profitability 
we are also very careful with our facility and data center expansion practices 
currently  we sell to businesses in more than countries 
unlike a colocation provider  we do not need to be located near our customers  allowing us to build or lease centralized  cost optimized facilities with teams of highly trained staff 
we strive to locate our regional facilities and data centers in lower cost locations  which reduces rent  power and labor costs 
we also focus on either leasing or building sections of data centers in increments so that capital expenditures are more closely matched to revenue growth 
we have made significant investments in cloud computing 
over the last several years  we have made acquisitions that have expanded our product set into new areas of cloud computing  including private cloud  openstack and rackspace cloud builders 
we will continue to identify and pursue strategic investments that have the potential to generate savings  enhance our competitive advantage  and increase our capabilities to serve customers 
we have achieved a critical mass that generates long term cost advantages 
like any service that moves from distributed to centralized production  scale is a factor in ensuring costs are low enough to drive mass adoption 
we are able to generate significant cost advantages based on our large installed customer base and growth profile 
we purchase large quantities of computing and data center assets  which allows us to negotiate higher volume pricing savings 
key metrics we carefully track several financial and operational metrics to monitor and manage our growth  financial performance  and capacity 
our key metrics are structured around growth  profitability  capital efficiency  infrastructure capacity  and utilization 
the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the notes to the financial statements and other financial information included in this annual report on form k

table of contents see discussion and reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap measures 
due to rounding  totals may not equal the sum of the line items in the table above 
customers are counted on an account basis  and therefore a customer with more than one account with us is included as more than one customer 
furthermore  amounts include saas customers for jungle disk using a rackspace storage solution 
jungle disk customers using a third party storage solution are excluded 
technical square footage as of december  excludes  square feet for unused portions of our data center facilities 
we have historically defined technical square feet of data center space as space that can be utilized to support it equipment 
with respect to square footage and utilization  for data centers that are not yet fully utilized  we include square footage and power capacity based on the agreed upon schedule in the lease agreement 
for example  if the agreement has ten phases and we are in phase five  we include of the total square footage and power capacity called for in the lease agreement 
as a result of our strategy to continue leasing data centers  beginning in the first quarter of  we will begin disclosing our total megawatts under contract  megawatts available for use and megawatts utilized as of period end 
we will no longer provide technical square footage as we believe that power is a better metric for evaluating our capacity 
the table below shows how the new disclosure would have appeared in the key metrics table 
year ended december  dollar amounts in thousands megawatts under contract at period end megawatts available for use at period end megawatts utilized at period end net revenue per average megawatt of power utilized executive overview to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of part ii of this report 
in we focused on accelerating the growth of our business while maintaining our profits and returns and focusing on the minimal use of cash to achieve our growth 
growth of our business 
our business grew in with net revenue growth year over year of million  or  to  million compared to million in our increase in net revenue was primarily due to increased volume of services provided  due to both an increasing number of new customers and incremental services rendered to existing customers 
year over year revenue increases were for our dedicated cloud hosting service and for our public cloud hosting service 
also contributing to the revenue increase was the positive impact of a weaker us dollar relative to the pound sterling 
net revenue in would have been approximately million lower had the us dollar to the pound sterling exchange rate remained constant from the prior year 
our performance was the result of a combination of continued market demand for our services as well as our focused execution on our growth strategy 
as of december   we served over  customers running on over  servers within our data centers in the us  the us  and hong kong  which represented incremental increases in each category as compared to during  our monthly average churn rate was  compared to in overall  our installed base continued to provide a portion of our growth in  growing at a monthly average rate of in  compared to in and in  respectively 
in the fourth quarter of  our churn rate was and installed base growth was 
the increase in net upgrades is primarily due to an increasing number of larger customers within our customer base  as well as increasing spend by these customers 
these larger customers generally have higher net upgrades 

table of contents our revenue growth has moved us into a new competitive landscape where our direct competitors are much larger and stronger financially 
we will continue to compete more directly with amazon  microsoft  ibm and google as cloud computing services become increasingly more virtualized 
accordingly  we have been making increased infrastructure investments to complement and leverage fanatical support  our principal differentiation from our competitors across our multiple service offerings 
our cloud computing services provide customers with a mission critical service and world class support  and we believe this provides us with substantial growth opportunities 
we believe that by offering a higher service level agreement and extending our support to new technology platforms  our business becomes more capital efficient and our competitive advantage widens as our service capability increases 
scaling profits and returns 
while accelerating our revenue growth rate in  profit margins increased as well  particularly during the second half of the year 
income from operations increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in operating income margin was in as compared to in adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in in addition  adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue was in compared to in see the following section on non gaap financial measures for a discussion of adjusted ebitda 
net income was million or per share on a diluted basis in  compared to net income of million  or per share on a diluted basis in net income margin was in as compared to in use of cash 
for the year ended december   we had negative adjusted free cash flow of million 
see below for our discussion of non gaap financial measures 
during  we were able to maintain a consistent level of cash and cash equivalents while growing our business by maintaining our disciplined use of capital 
our capital expenditures for were million  of which million was vendor financed  while our cash provided by operating activities was million 
in  we deployed an additional  servers  bringing our total servers to  an increase of 
as of december   we had million in cash deposits and million in money market funds 
company highlights and developments product and service offerings we continue to invest in our public cloud service and believe it is a critical part of our future success 
public cloud continues to emerge as a new technology with high adoption rates and investment  which is reflected in its high revenue growth rate 
the primary benefit of public cloud is the value proposition that it provides for businesses 
it enables them to match costs directly to revenue and to scale up and down on a real time basis as necessary 
we do not believe that public cloud will replace traditional dedicated cloud hosting offerings 
we believe the two complement one another  allowing customers to choose from a portfolio of offerings to meet their business needs 
a focus in our growth strategy is to build our product portfolio to include higher service levels and additional capabilities 
we are investing heavily in this strategy and creating new technologies to help businesses leverage the benefits of public cloud hosting 
hosted virtual desktop  our managed cloud service  the uk cloud  and cloud load balancers are a few of the recent examples of new capabilities we have developed that are available in the market today that make us more competitive  drive revenue growth  and improve returns 
our product road map includes a variety of new capabilities and features including cloud block storage  enhancements to rackconnect  and building a support business around the openstack cloud computing platform 
based on our experience working with customers running openstack  we are ready to move into the next phase of our openstack strategy with the introduction of a new service we call rackspace cloud private edition 
this new offering will enable rackspace to extend fanatical support beyond the bounds of our data centers by remotely supporting and managing openstack environments that run in almost any data center 
while this initiative is still in its early stages of development  rackspace cloud private edition is an opportunity to drive incremental demand 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for the specified periods and as a percentage of our revenue for those same periods

of this increase  million was attributable to an increase in employee related expenses due to increases in salaries and benefits of million and non equity incentive compensation of million  partially offset by a million decrease in share based compensation expense 
these increases were the result of the hiring of data center and support personnel to support our growth and higher percentage attainment against the preset target for non equity incentive compensation 
the cost increase was further attributable to an increase in data center costs of million related to bandwidth  power and rent  and an increase in license costs of million 
the remaining increase was due to small variances in other cost of revenue expenses 
sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses were million during and million during  an increase of million  or
