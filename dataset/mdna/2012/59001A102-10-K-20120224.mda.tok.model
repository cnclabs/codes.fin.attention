item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and outlook industry conditions while the economy and homebuilding markets continued to be challenged during  we have recently seen indications that demand for new homes is stabilizing in some of our markets 
therefore  despite above average foreclosure and unemployment rates  increased interest and traffic in our communities and homes have resulted in improving sales in certain parts of the country 
the first half of was comparatively less successful than the first half of  mostly due to an elevated level of closings as a result of the federal homebuyer tax credit program  but the second half of showed comparative improvement  as our sales units increased as well as our average sales prices and backlog year over year 
we finished on a positive note by posting gains in the fourth quarter in many of our key operating metrics and we continued to focus on generating greater profit on each sale while controlling our overhead expense 
we believe a full economic and real estate recovery will continue to be an uneven process and will not fully materialize until there is broad  sustainable employment and the consumer confidence returns 
we ended with higher expectations for early as we enter the new year with higher levels of backlog than last year 
summary company results total home closing revenue was million for the year ended december   decreasing from million for and from million in we incurred a net loss for of million compared to net income of million in and a loss of million in full year home closing revenue and net income benefitted from closings that spiked the first half of the year because of the federal homebuyer tax credit program 
there was no such benefit in  resulting in difficult year over year comparisons 
our results include million of real estate related impairments 
in  results included million of real estate related impairments  million loss from early extinguishment of debt  and a million tax benefit 
in  we incurred million of real estate related impairments  million gain from early extinguishment of debt  and had an million tax benefit relating to reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance 
at december   our backlog of million was up from million at december  our december  backlog was million  higher comparatively  largely due to the federal homebuyer tax credit program that translated into higher closing units and dollars in the first half of  as discussed above 
increased home sales per community and a higher active community count in the second half of were primarily responsible for the increase in ending backlog over our average sales price for homes in backlog increased to  up from  at december   and up from  at december   primarily due to mix of homes shifting to higher priced markets  and more sought after closer in locations 
our cancellation rate on sales orders as a percentage of gross sales decreased in to  down from and  respectively  for the years ended december  and we believe the combination of these positive factors reflect some stabilization of home prices and consumer confidence during the second half of the year and as we enter company actions and positioning throughout this continued difficult homebuilding market  we have remained focused on our main goals return to and maintain profitability  and strengthen our balance sheet 
in order to meet these goals  over the past several years we began and continue to execute on the following initiatives utilizing our enhanced market research to capitalize on the knowledge of our buyers demands in each community  tailoring our pricing  product and amenities offered  continuing to innovate and promote the meritage green energy efficiency program  so that every new home we construct  at a minimum  meets current energy star standards  including the construction of our first net zero production home that produces as much energy as it uses annually  managing our total lot supply and future growth of our communities by actively contracting new well priced lots in better located submarkets  adapting sales and marketing efforts to generate additional traffic and compete with resale homes including a marketing call center as a resource for our buyers  
table of contents renegotiating construction costs with our subcontractors where possible  exercising tight control over cash flows  monitoring our customer satisfaction scores and working toward improving them based on the results of the surveys  executing our company wide operating strategy  meritage forward  and the roll out of associated initiatives such as the simply smart series tm and day closing guarantee  and maintaining consolidated overhead functions at all of our divisions and corporate offices to hold down general and administrative cost burden 
additionally  we are evaluating opportunities for expansion into new markets that have been less impacted by the homebuilding downturn over the past several years 
we are looking to redeploy our capital into projects both within our geographic footprint and through entry into new markets 
to that end  in april we announced our entry into the raleigh durham  north carolina market and in december announced our entry into the tampa  florida market 
we believe that the investments in our new communities  markets and product offerings create a differentiated strategy that has lessened the impact of the current economic conditions and improved our operating leverage 
throughout  we opened new communities while closing out communities  ending the year with active communities 
we continue to believe in the long term viability of the domestic homebuilding market and that builders with in depth industry expertise  successful business and operational models and well priced land positions will benefit when the housing market recovers 
in a response to our strategy to take advantage of capital raising opportunities we have completed the following transactions during  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at of par value to yield 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we purchased all of our million senior notes maturing and million of our senior notes maturing in connection with these transactions  we recorded a million loss on early extinguishment of debt  which is reflected in our statement of operations for the year ended december  this transaction pushed out our earliest maturity from to and reduced our maturity by million 
during we retired million of our senior subordinated notes maturing in by issuing approximately  shares of our common stock in privately negotiated transactions at a average discount from the face value of the notes  resulting in a million gain on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended december  we continue to closely monitor capital markets and our liquidity and will undertake additional transactions if and when we deem most prudent 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
certain of these policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenue and costs 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic  environmental and political factors and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are revised when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in methodologies are reflected in our reported results of operations and  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use and believe to be critical to our business are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates and could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 

table of contents the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue from a home sale when title passes to the homeowner  the homeowner s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the home  the receivable  if any  from the homeowner is not subject to future subordination and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the sold home 
these conditions are typically achieved when a home closes 
revenue from land sales is recognized when a significant down payment is received  the earnings process is relatively complete  title passes and collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
although there is limited subjectivity in this accounting policy  we have designated revenue recognition as a critical accounting policy due to the significance of this balance in our statements of operations 
real estate real estate is stated at cost unless the community or land is determined to be impaired  at which point the inventory is written down to fair value as required by financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  property  plant and equipment 
inventory includes the costs of land acquisition  land development and home construction  capitalized interest  real estate taxes  direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction that benefit the entire community  less impairments  if any 
land and development costs are typically allocated and transferred to homes under construction when home construction begins 
home construction costs are accumulated on a per home basis 
cost of home closings includes the specific construction costs of the home and all related allocated land acquisition  land development and other common costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each community or phase 
any changes to the estimated total development costs of a community or phase are allocated to the remaining homes in the community or phase 
when a home closes  we may have incurred costs for goods and services that have not yet been paid 
therefore  an accrual to capture such obligations is recorded in connection with the home closing and charged directly to cost of sales 
typically  an entitled community s life cycle ranges from three to five years  commencing with the acquisition of the land  continuing through the land development phase and concluding with the sale  construction and closing of the homes 
actual community lives will vary based on the size of the community  the absorption rates and whether the land purchased was raw land or finished lots 
master planned communities encompassing several phases and super block land parcels may have significantly longer lives and projects involving smaller finished lot purchases may be significantly shorter 
additionally  the current slow down in the housing market has negatively impacted our sales pace  thereby extending the lives of certain communities 
all of our land inventory and related real estate assets are reviewed for recoverability at least quarterly  or more frequently if impairment indicators are present  as our inventory is considered long lived in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
if an asset is deemed not recoverable  we record an impairment charge to the extent the fair value of such assets is less than their carrying amounts 
our determination of fair value is based on projections and estimates 
changes in these expectations may lead to a change in the outcome of our impairment analysis and actual results may also differ from our assumptions 
our analysis is completed at a community level with each community or land parcel evaluated individually 
we pay particular attention to communities experiencing a larger than anticipated reduction in their absorption rates or averages sales prices or where gross margins are trending lower than anticipated 
for those assets deemed to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the assets carrying balance exceeds their fair value 
the impairment of a community is allocated to each lot on a straight line basis 
existing and continuing communities 
when projections for the remaining income expected to be earned from existing communities are no longer positive  the underlying real estate assets are not deemed fully recoverable  and further analysis is performed to determine the required impairment 
the fair value of the community s assets is determined using either a discounted cash flow model for projects we intend to build out or a market based approach for projects to be sold 
if our assets are not deemed fully recoverable  impairments are charged to cost of home closings in the period during which it is determined that the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount 
if a market based approach is used  we determine fair value based on recent comparable purchase and sale activity in the local market  adjusted for known variances as determined by our knowledge of the region and general real estate expertise 
if a discounted cash flow approach is used  we compute fair value based on a proprietary model 
our key estimates in deriving fair value under our cash flow model are i home selling prices in the community 
table of contents adjusted for current and expected sales discounts and incentives  ii costs related to the community both land development and home construction including costs spent to date and budgeted remaining costs to spend  iii projected sales absorption rates  reflecting any product mix change strategies implemented to stimulate the sales pace and expected cancellation rates  iv alternative land uses including disposition of all or a portion of the land owned and v our discount rate  which is currently and varies based on the perceived risk inherent in the community s other cash flow assumptions 
these assumptions vary widely across different communities and geographies and are largely dependent on local market conditions 
community level factors that may impact our key estimates include the presence and significance of local competitors  including their offered product type and competitive actions  economic and related demographic conditions for the population of the surrounding community  desirability of the particular community  including unique amenities or other favorable or unfavorable attributes  and existing home inventory supplies  including foreclosures and short sales 
these local circumstances may significantly impact our assumptions and the resulting computation of fair value  and are  therefore  closely evaluated by our division personnel in their creation of the discounted cash flow models 
the models are also evaluated by regional and corporate personnel for consistency and integration  as decisions that affect pricing or absorption at one community may have resulting consequences for neighboring communities 
we typically do not project market improvements in our discounted cash flow models  but may do so in limited circumstances in the latter years of a long lived community 
in certain cases  we may elect to stop development and or marketing of an existing community mothball if we believe the economic performance of the community would be maximized by deferring development for a period of time to allow market conditions to improve 
the decision may be based on financial and or operational metrics 
if we decide to mothball a project and its carrying value is not deemed recoverable  we will impair it to its fair value as discussed above and then cease future development activity until such a time where management believes that market conditions will improve and economic performance will be maximized 
no costs are capitalized to communities that are designated as mothball 
quarterly  we review all communities  including mothballed communities  for potential impairments 
for our land held for future development and our mothballed communities  our inventory assessments typically include significant estimates regarding future performance  including the timing of development  the product to be offered  sales rates and selling prices of the product when the community is anticipated to open for sales  and the projected costs to develop and construct the community 
we evaluate various factors to develop our forecasts  including the availability of and demand for homes and finished lots within the marketplace  historical  current and future sales trends  and other third party data  if available 
based on these factors  we reach conclusions for future performance based on our judgment 
option deposits and pre acquisition costs we also evaluate assets associated with future communities for impairments on a quarterly basis 
using similar techniques described in the existing and continuing communities section above  we determine if the income to be generated by our future communities are acceptable to us 
if the projections indicate that a community is still meeting our internal investment guidelines and is generating a profit  those assets are determined to be fully recoverable and no impairments are required 
in cases where we decide to abandon the project  we will fully impair all assets related to such project and will expense and accrue any additional costs that we are contractually obligated to incur 
in certain circumstances  we may also elect to continue with a project because it is expected to generate positive future cash flows  even though it may not be generating an accounting profit  or because of other strategic factors 
in such cases  we will impair our pre acquisition costs and deposits  as necessary  to record an impairment to bring the book value to fair value 
due to the complexity and subjectivity of these fair value computations  as well as the significance of associated impairments to our financial statements for the past several years  we have concluded that the valuation of our real estate and associated assets is a critical accounting policy 
during  we recorded million of such impairment charges related to our home and land inventories 
additionally  we wrote off approximately million of deposits and pre acquisition costs relating to projects that were no longer economically feasible 
refer to note of these consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion regarding these impairments and the associated remaining fair values of impaired communities 
the impairment charges were based on our fair value calculations  which are affected by current market conditions  assumptions and expectations  all of which are highly subjective and may differ significantly from actual results if market conditions change 

table of contents due to the volume of possible outcomes that can be generated from changes in the various model inputs for each community  we do not believe it is possible to create a sensitivity analysis that can provide meaningful information for the users of our financial statements 
warranty reserves we use subcontractors for nearly all aspects of home construction 
although our subcontractors are generally required to repair and replace any product or labor defects  we are  during applicable warranty periods  ultimately responsible to the homeowner for making such repairs 
as such  warranty reserves are recorded to cover our exposure to absorb the costs for materials and labor not expected to be covered by our subcontractors to the extent they relate to warranty type claims subsequent to the delivery of a home to the homeowner 
reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and  with the assistance of an actuary for the structural related warranty  we determine their sufficiency based on our and industry wide historical data and trends 
these reserves are subject to variability due to uncertainties regarding structural defect claims for the products we build  the markets in which we build  claim settlement history  insurance and legal interpretations  among other factors 
at december   our warranty reserve was million  reflecting an accrual of to of a home s sale price depending on our loss history in the geographic area in which the home was built 
a increase in our warranty reserve rate would have increased our accrual and corresponding cost of sales by approximately  in we recorded a million favorable adjustment to our reserve in based on historical trends of actual claims paid and our success in recovery of expended amounts 
while we believe that the warranty reserve is sufficient to cover our projected costs  there can be no assurances that historical data and trends will accurately predict our actual warranty costs 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that future economic or financial developments might not lead to a significant change in the reserve 
off balance sheet arrangements historically  we have invested in entities that acquire and develop land for sale to us in connection with our homebuilding operations or for sale to third parties 
our partners generally are unaffiliated homebuilders  land sellers and financial or other strategic partners 
we currently are a member of only two such active land joint ventures 
all entities through which we acquire and develop land are accounted for by either the cost or the equity method of accounting where the criteria for consolidation have not been met as set forth in asc  consolidation asc 
we record our investments in these entities in our consolidated balance sheets as investments in unconsolidated entities and our pro rata share of the entities earnings or losses in our consolidated statements of earnings as earnings loss from unconsolidated entities  net 
in order to determine if we should consolidate equity basis joint ventures  we determine if the ventures are vies and if we are the primary beneficiary of the unconsolidated entity 
factors considered in our determination include our ability to control the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance  and in cases where we do control such activities  if we also are expected to absorb the majority of the expected losses or expected gains of the entity 
for those entities where we are deemed the primary beneficiary  we consolidate the investment in our financial statements in accordance with asc we enter into option or purchase agreements to acquire land or lots  for which we generally pay non refundable deposits 
we also analyze these agreements under asc to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity vie  if applicable  using a similar analysis  as noted above 
if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  we will consolidate the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
see note in the accompanying financial statements for additional information related to our off balance sheet arrangements 
in cases where we are the primary beneficiary  even though we do not have title to such land  we are required to consolidate these purchase option agreements and reflect such assets and liabilities as real estate not owned in our consolidated balance sheets 
the liabilities related to consolidated vies are excluded from our debt covenant calculations 
valuation of deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized based on future tax consequences of both temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted 

table of contents in accordance with asc  income taxes  we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including the benefit from nols  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
companies must assess  using significant judgments  whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the length of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with operating losses and our experience of utilizing tax credit carryforwards and tax planning alternatives 
based upon a review of all available evidence  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during we continue to maintain a full non cash valuation allowance against the entire amount of our remaining net deferred tax assets at december  as we have determined that the weight of the negative evidence exceeds that of the positive evidence and it continues to be more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers 
at december  and  we had a valuation allowance of million million federal and million state and million million federal and million state  respectively  against deferred tax assets which include the tax benefit from nol carryovers 
our future deferred tax asset realization depends on sufficient taxable income in the carryforward periods under existing tax laws 
federal net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income for years and expire in state net operating loss carryforwards may be used to offset future taxable income for a period of time ranging from to years  depending on the state  and begin to expire in deferred tax assets include tax effected federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million in and  respectively 
on an ongoing basis  we will continue to review all available evidence to determine if and when we expect to realize our deferred tax assets and nol carryovers 
share based payments we have stock options and restricted common stock units nonvested shares outstanding under our stock compensation plan 
per the terms of the plan  the exercise price of our stock options may not be less than the closing market value of our common stock on the date of grant  nor may options granted under the plans be exercised within one year from the date of the grant 
after one year  exercises are permitted in pre determined installments based upon a vesting schedule established at the time of grant 
each stock option expires on a date determined at the time of the grant  but not to exceed seven years from the date of the grant 
our restricted stock generally vests on a pro rata basis over either three or five years 
the calculation of employee compensation expense involves estimates that require management judgments 
these estimates include determining the value of each of our stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model discussed in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our stock options  which typically vest ratably over a five year period  is determined at the time of grant and is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting life of the options 
expected volatility is based on a composite of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility from our traded options 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock option award is based on the rate of a zero coupon treasury bond on the date the stock option is granted with a maturity equal to the expected term of the stock option 
we use historical data to estimate stock option exercises and forfeitures within our valuation model 
the expected life of our stock option awards is derived from historical experience under our share based payment plans and represents the period of time that we expect our stock options to be outstanding 
a decrease in our forfeiture rate would have increased our stock compensation by approximately  in

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million  an decrease when compared to the prior year  due to a unit reduction in units closed that was partially offset by a  increase in average closing price 
the decrease in closing units is mainly attributable to the higher closing volumes that the federal homebuyer tax credit program generated in the first half of our results  with no such benefit in sales increased to million and  units in as compared to million and  units in  reflecting increased average sales prices of  or  and our lower cancellation rate of as compared to in improved demand in the latter part of resulted in a unit increase in our year end backlog  ending with homes as compared to homes in additionally  the value of orders in backlog increased due to a  or increase in average sales price for the year ended december  versus the same period a year ago 
our average price increase in was a result of a shift in our mix to higher priced markets and desirable closer in locations 
our active community count increased to communities at the end of as compared to in west 
in  home closings dipped to units with a value of million  a decrease of million or  attributable to fewer units  a drop from the decrease in closing units and revenue are mainly attributable to a slower sales pace in the first half of the year  translating into fewer deliveries in in addition to the federal tax credit  california also offered a state homebuyer tax credit during  which positively impacted comparative sales volumes in increases in sales as the year progressed led to a unit or million increase in orders for in california as compared to  resulting in an increase in ending backlog in the region of million on units  a and increase  respectively 
these increases  coupled with the  increase in average sales price  led to ending backlog in the region valued at million on units 
the california improvements were aided by a increase in our average active community count in  up to as of year end 
the nevada market saw declines in closings  orders and backlog 
this is expected to continue as we wind down our operations in this market 
central 
the central region closed  units totaling million in revenues  and  respectively  lower than those reported in a major factor in the region s results is the unit or decrease in home closings in texas from the same period a year ago  due primarily to its decrease in active communities 
offsetting some of the closing declines in texas were increased closings in colorado  up units  while arizona s results remained mostly flat as unit decreases were mostly offset by closing price increases 
the decrease in active communities in texas was a result of closing out of lower performing subdivisions in less desirable submarkets in texas and the strategic redeployment of capital to other markets in that presented better opportunities to generate higher average sales prices and margins 
this strategy has resulted in the rebalancing of assets from texas into other markets  primarily california  arizona  colorado and florida  although texas continues to be an important contributor to our financial results  and we contracted for additional communities there in the central region s sales decline of units resulted in a unit drop in ending backlog of versus units at december  and  respectively  however  the  average sales price increase translated to a higher ending backlog value of million  an increase of  in average sales price 
well positioned communities in desirable submarkets  primarily in arizona  are largely to credit for the higher average sales prices that have benefitted this region 
arizona had a year over year decrease in sales of units  but a million increase in total sales value 
the unit decrease is mostly due to results in the first half of the year as discussed previously 
however  the sales value gains are due to the higher average sales prices 
arizona ended the year with more units in backlog  valued at million  a increase over the same period a year ago due to increasing sales volumes in the latter half of colorado is the only state in the region that did not experience a decline in sales in  recognizing a increase in orders to for the year ended december   coupled with a  or increase in average sales price 
this momentum led colorado to end the year with units in backlog valued at million  a increase over east 
our east region generated closings with million of home revenue in  a and increase  respectively from the same period in and was the only region without lower year over year closing comparisons 
the region also experienced significant sales improvements generating million of additional sales  due to both a increase in unit sales as well as a  increase in average sales price in versus the florida market was the largest contributor to the region s results  although sales operations in our north carolina market commenced in the fourth quarter  contributing units  or million  in order volume and backlog from three actively selling communities 
we ended with units in backlog with a value of million  and increases from  respectively 
we believe that our community locations have helped the overall performance of this region  and our construction has primarily been large product with green features that appeals to our buyers 

table of contents land closing revenue and gross profit from time to time  we may sell certain land parcels to other homebuilders  developers or investors if we feel the sale will provide a greater economic benefit to us than continuing home construction or where we are looking to diversify our land positions in the specific geography 
as a result of such sales  we recognized land closing revenue of million  and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 
we also recognized impairments related to land sales and on parcels marketed for future sale in the amount of million  and million for the years ending december   and  respectively 
of our impairments  million related to parcels we intend to sell in connection with our wind down of our las vegas operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closings for the year ended december  remained relatively flat at million  a decrease when compared to  primarily due to a unit reduction in units closed  mostly offset by a  increase in average closing price 
lower sales volume of  units in as compared to  in reflected the weakened demand caused by the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit 
absorptions in were partially aided by our lower cancellation rate of as compared to in closings exceeded sales in the latter part of the year  resulting in a unit decrease in our backlog in  down to homes as compared to  homes in our active community count dipped slightly from  as did our average sales per community at during  as compared to during west 
in  home closings grew to units with a value of million  increases of million and units  or and  respectively  over the nevada market experienced continued weakness with a sales unit decrease  more than offsetting our unit gain in california 
the california improvements were aided by a doubling of our active community count in  up to as of year end 
the region had success early in the year  as sales orders and closings increased due in part to the extension of the homebuyer tax credit 
in the latter part of the year  the expiration of the federal homebuyer tax credit and uncertain economy negatively impacted operations  resulted in sales of units  a decline from the higher closing volume and decrease in sales directly impacted ending backlog of units  down from in central 
the central region s closings of  deliveries totaling million in revenues were and  lower than those reported in  respectively 
largely impacting the region s results was the slowing of our texas markets  as indicated by the unit or decrease in home closings from  and due primarily to its decrease in active communities 
offsetting some of the closing declines in texas were increased closings in colorado  while arizona results remained mostly flat as unit decreases were primarily offset by closing price increases 
the region s sales declined units in  resulted in a or unit decrease in ending backlog at december  as compared to arizona operations had a decrease in ending backlog to units 
however  the new communities that opened in the latter part of and in generated higher average sales prices  nearly offsetting the unit decline and resulting in a relatively flat backlog of million  down only  but units from colorado continued to be the only state in the region that did not experience any sales or backlog deterioration from to this was primarily due to an increase in active community count of  which contributed million of additional sales volume and million of additional backlog in versus texas sales reflected the same trends as its revenue  with million and unit declines from east 
we generated closings with million of home revenue in  a and increase from our east region experienced similar sales improvements generated million of additional sales volume  due to both a increase in unit sales as well as a  increase in average sales price in versus we ended with units in backlog with a value of million  and decreased from  and an increased average sales price of  as closings outpaced sales in the final half of the year

we provide gross margins excluding impairments a non gaap term as we use it to evaluate our performance and believe it is a widely accepted financial measure by users of our financial statements in analyzing our operating results and provides comparability to similar calculations by our peers in the homebuilding industry 
however  gross margins excluding impairments as presented may not be fully comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies because not all companies calculate this metric in an identical manner 
this measure is not intended to represent gaap gross margins and it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap

excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the impairments are primarily related to our las vegas assets 
gross margins excluding impairments dipped in  mostly due to additional price concessions in california  particularly in the first part of the year 
we anticipate some margin improvement in california in 
table of contents central 
the central region s home closing gross margin was relatively flat as compared to in during  we maintained near normal margins in most of our communities as most of the lots in this region are well priced and located in desirable submarkets

east 
while the east region continues to generate the highest gross margins for us  we saw a decrease in to versus in and in versus in  excluding impairments 
the decrease is mainly due to the close out of certain highly profitable communities in late and our entry into certain highly desirable and high volume communities that had additional building and design requirements that resulted in some cost increases 
we believe the above average margins and the increased number of sale and closings these communities deliver outweigh the slight decrease in margins 
fiscal compared to fiscal companywide 
home closing gross margin improved to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  gross margins excluding impairments were and for and  respectively 
our new communities with well priced lots located in good submarkets contributed to the gross margin gains in our margins also benefited from the continued cost cutting measures and building efficiencies we have achieved in and our impairment charges reflected the write down to fair value of certain real estate and related assets 
we recorded only million of impairments in  a million decrease from our impairments in reflected the continuation of soft market conditions in some of our geographies  particularly in our legacy communities in texas as we push to close them out 
west 
our west region improved its home closing gross margin to for from a negative margin of in these margins included impairments of million in versus million in the prior year 
excluding these impairments  the gross margins for and were and  respectively 
the improvement in our pre impairment gross margins was mostly attributable to our desirable locations in our california markets that achieved more normalized margins 
central 
the central region s home closing gross profit increased  basis points as compared to in  primarily due to fewer community impairments recorded in as compared to the same period a year ago and cost savings in materials and construction costs 
during  we were successful in earning near normal margins in many of our new communities in arizona and colorado as the lots were well priced and were located in more desirable submarkets 
the central region s home closing gross margins included million of real estate related impairments for compared to million for excluding these impairments  the gross margin in this region increased to in versus in east 
our east region experienced a significant increase in gross margins earning for versus a negative margin of for the increase in home closing margins was primarily due to reduced impairments recorded  million and million during and  respectively 
gross margins also increased due to the closings generated by our new communities  which tend to earn higher margins and higher average closing prices of  excluding these impairments  gross margins would have been for the region for and for benefitting from our new communities as previously discussed 

table of contents september  september  september  years ended december  in thousands commissions and other sales costs dollars percent of home closing revenue general and administrative expenses dollars percent of total closing revenue interest expense dollars benefit provision for income taxes dollars fiscal compared to fiscal commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs are comprised of internal and external commissions and related sales and marketing expenses such as advertising and sales office costs 
these costs decreased by million for versus the decrease primarily relates to reduced commission expense attributable to lower closing units and revenue dollars 
the increase year over year as a percentage of revenue is primarily the result of lower revenue coupled with the introduction of strategically targeted marketing campaigns  including increased investments in alternative marketing channels  such as the internet and social media outlets 
in addition  we established a marketing call center this year  which provides centralized sales and marketing information to our homebuyers nation wide seven days a week 
we expect the call center to contribute a significant number of our future sales and closings 
we continue to focus on regionalizing and nationalizing marketing campaigns in order to gain efficiencies and reduce costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses represent corporate and divisional overhead expenses such as salaries and bonuses  occupancy  insurance and travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for versus million in  or and of total revenue  respectively 
included in those figures is increased stock based compensation expense  the divisional overhead costs to start up a new division in north carolina  upgrades to our market research and technology tools and increased legal fees and settlements 
we expect to be able to capitalize on our research and technology investments and on our centralized operations as the economy improves with limited general and administrative expense increases 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised of interest incurred  but not capitalized  on our senior and senior subordinated notes  and other borrowings 
during and  our non capitalizable interest expense was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in expense year over year is a result of a higher amount of active assets under development that qualify for interest capitalization 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rates were a provision of for  compared to a benefit of for the change in our tax rate is primarily attributable to the texas franchise tax on our gross margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs decreased by million for versus the decrease primarily related to reduced commission expense attributable to lower closing units and revenue dollars as well as reduced sales office and model maintenance costs 
over the past several quarters  we have migrated to a more efficient field marketing structure by reducing the number of models and corresponding operating costs in our model and sales complexes 
in  these savings were partially offset by increased grand opening and marketing costs associated with our extreme green communities 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly to million for versus million in meritage was one of the first homebuilders to aggressively cut overhead and associated general and administrative expenses as the market began its downward cycle in late and therefore  was continuing to operate under this efficient  lean structure  resulting in relatively flat year over year dollar comparisons

liquidity and capital resources overview our principal uses of capital for were operating expenses  home construction  the payment of routine liabilities  and the acquisition of new and strategic lot positions 
we used funds generated by operations and our cash reserves to meet our short term working capital requirements 
throughout the challenging and extended downturn in the housing market  we have focused on generating cash by exiting certain markets and land positions and maintaining margins in our homebuilding operations 
these efforts have in turn helped us weather the prolonged downturn while maintaining a strong balance sheet and keeping us poised for future growth 
in  we began to utilize some of our excess cash reserves to grow our inventory balances  particularly increasing our lot positions in anticipation of an improving market 
cash flows for each of our communities depend on their stage of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are a component of our inventory and not recognized in our statement of operations until a home closes  we incur significant cash outlays prior to recognition of earnings 
in the later stages of a community  cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as the cash outflow associated with home and land construction was previously incurred 
from a liquidity standpoint  we are currently actively acquiring and developing lots in our markets to maintain and start to grow our lot supply and active community count  replacing older communities that are near close out and acquiring communities in strategic and attractive locations we deem key to our success 
accordingly  as demand for new homes improves and we begin to expand our business  we expect that cash outlays for land purchases and land development may exceed our cash generated by operations 
during  we closed  homes  purchased about  lots for million  spent million on land development  and started about  homes 
as one of our initiatives is to manage our lot supply with well priced lots in strategic submarkets  the opportunity to purchase substantially finished lots in desired locations is becoming increasingly more limited and competitive 
accordingly  we are spending more dollars on land development as we are purchasing more partially finished lots than in recent years 
we exercise strict controls and believe we have a prudent strategy for company wide cash management  particularly as related to cash outlays for land and inventory acquisition and development 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  investments and securities  and restricted cash 
as we have no debt maturities until  we intend to generate cash from the sale of our inventory  but throughout  we have begun to redeploy that cash to acquire and develop strategic and well positioned lots that represent opportunities to generate more normal margins  as well as for other operating purposes 
in addition to expanding our business in existing markets  we continue to look into opportunities to expand outside of our existing markets 
in april  we announced our entry into the raleigh durham  north carolina market 
we have since acquired several land parcels in raleigh durham  commenced construction of our model parks and began sales operations in the fourth quarter of this opportunity expands our footprint into a new market with positive growth potential 
the raleigh cary market was ranked as the healthiest homebuilding market for by hanley wood market intelligence  a leading industry source  and the neighboring durham chapel hill market ranked entry into the raleigh durham area offers us growth opportunities based on a number of positive factors  including a growing employment base  rising median incomes  and affordable cost of living 
we also announced our entry in the tampa  florida market in december where we are actively pursuing land holdings at this time 
we expect to leverage our local market expertise in florida to manage our tampa operations 
we continue to evaluate our capital needs in light of ongoing developments in homebuilding markets and our existing capital structure 
we believe that we currently have strong liquidity 
nevertheless  we may seek additional capital to strengthen our liquidity position  enable us to opportunistically acquire additional land inventory in anticipation of improving market conditions  and or strengthen our long term capital structure 
such additional capital may be in the form of equity or debt financing and may be from a variety of sources 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain such 
table of contents additional capital on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and such additional equity or debt financing could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders or increase our interest costs 
alternatively  if we believe that we have excess liquidity  we may elect to either repurchase our debt or outstanding equity 
we believe that our leverage ratios provide useful information to the users of our financial statements regarding our financial position and cash and debt management

senior and senior subordinated notes senior notes in march  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in april  we repurchased million of our senior notes  resulting in million in aggregate principal remaining on the notes 
the indenture which governs the senior notes requires us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including limiting the amount of additional indebtedness we can incur unless after giving effect to such additional indebtedness  either i our fixed charge coverage ratio would be at least to or ii our ratio of unconsolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth would be less than to together  the ratio requirement  provided  however  this limitation does not generally apply to most types of inter company indebtedness  purchase money indebtedness  other indebtedness up to million and non recourse indebtedness  generally limiting the amount of dividends  redemptions of equity interests and certain investments we can make to million plus i of our net income since june  plus ii of the net cash proceeds from the sale of qualified equity interests  plus other items and subject to other exceptions  limiting our ability to incur or create certain liens  placing limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates  and limiting the amount of investments we can make in joint ventures in a permitted business with unaffiliated third parties to of our consolidated tangible net worth as defined in the indenture 
senior subordinated notes in february  we completed a million private placement of senior subordinated notes due these notes were issued at par  and their associated proceeds were used to pay down our prior credit facility 
the covenants related to these senior subordinated notes are substantially similar to the covenants of our senior notes discussed above 

table of contents senior notes during the second quarter of  we completed an offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes were issued at of par value to yield 
the indenture for our senior notes contains covenants including  among others  limitations on the amount of secured debt we may incur  and limitations on sale and leaseback transactions of non model home assets and mergers 
the covenants contained in the senior notes are generally no more restrictive  and in many cases less restrictive  than the covenants contained in the indentures for the senior notes and senior subordinated notes 
senior notes in april  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due in april  we repurchased all of the million of senior notes 
covenant compliance we were in compliance with all senior and subordinated note covenants as of december  in order to be out of compliance with the ratio requirement  we would need to fail both the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratios  not just one ratio independently 
a failure to meet both the fixed charge coverage and leverage ratio is not a default but rather results in a prohibition subject to exceptions from incurring additional indebtedness only

land under control we enter into various options and purchase contracts for land in the normal course of business 
generally  our options to purchase lots remain effective so long as we purchase a pre established minimum number of lots each month or quarter  as determined by the respective agreement 
the pre established number is typically structured to approximate our expected rate of home construction starts  although as demand slows  in some instances starts may fall below the pre established minimum number of lot purchases 
over the past several years  the slower sales rate caused us to take certain actions  including purchasing lots in advance of corresponding sales  re negotiating the takedown schedules  and discontinuing lot purchases and forfeiting the related non refundable option deposit 
additional information regarding our purchase agreements and related deposits is presented in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the total number of lots under control at december  was  as compared to  at december  in and  respectively  and of our controlled lots were owned 
the increase in our land holdings from prior year was due to an intentional effort to grow our lot positions in quality submarkets during  as we entered into new land contracts for approximately  lots for million as compared to approximately  lots for million in at december   our total option and purchase contracts had purchase prices in the aggregate of approximately million  on which we had made deposits of approximately million in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements reference is made to notes  and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these notes discuss our off balance sheet arrangements with respect to land acquisition contracts and option agreements  and land development joint ventures  including the nature and amounts of financial obligations relating to these items 
in addition  these notes discuss the nature and amounts of certain types of commitments that arise in connection with the ordinary course of our land development and homebuilding operations  including commitments of land development joint ventures for which we might be obligated

our operations are interest rate sensitive 
as overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates  a significant increase in mortgage interest rates may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and would also increase our variable rate borrowing costs 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
