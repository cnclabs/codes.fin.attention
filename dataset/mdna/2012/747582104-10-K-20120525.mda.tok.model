management overview quality systems  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries operate as four business divisions which are comprised of i the qsi dental division  ii the nextgen division  iii the hospital solutions division 
table of contents and iv the rcm services division 
in fiscal year  we opened a captive entity in india called quality systems india healthcare private limited qsih 
we primarily derive revenue by developing and marketing healthcare information systems that automate certain aspects of medical and dental practices  networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations phos and management service organizations msos  ambulatory care centers  community health centers and medical and dental schools along with comprehensive systems implementation  maintenance and support and add on complementary services such as revenue cycle management rcm and electronic data interchange edi 
our systems and services provide our clients with the ability to redesign patient care and other workflow processes while improving productivity through the facilitation of managed access to patient information 
utilizing our proprietary software in combination with third party hardware and software solutions  our products enable the integration of a variety of administrative and clinical information operations 
on august   we acquired sphere  a provider of financial information systems to the small hospital inpatient market 
on february   we acquired opus  a provider of web based clinical solutions to hospital systems and integrated health networks nationwide 
on april   we acquired intranexus  a provider of web based integrated clinical and hospital information systems 
on july   we acquired cqi  a provider of hospital systems for surgery management 
these acquisitions are part of tour strategy to expand into the small hospital market and to add new clients by taking advantage of cross selling opportunities between the ambulatory and inpatient markets 
all these companies were established developers of software and services for the inpatient market and are operating under the hospital solutions division 
on november   we acquired viatrack  a developer and provider of information technologies that enhance edi offerings 
this acquisition provides a platform to pursue significant opportunities that exist to add edi services to our portfolio of offerings in the inpatient market and is operating under the qsi dental division 
in january  qsih was formed in bangalore  india to function as our india based captive to offshore technology application development and business processing services 
our strategy is to focus on providing software and services to the medical and dental communities  both in the ambulatory and inpatient settings 
the key elements of this strategy are to continue development and enhancement of our software solutions to support healthcare reform and the transition from fee for service to pay for performance quality initiatives such as accountable care organizations 
we also want to continue to bring further integration between our ambulatory and inpatient products  to continue investments in our infrastructure including but not limited to product development  sales  marketing  implementation and support  to continue efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline  to add new clients through maintaining and expanding sales  marketing and product development activities and to expand our relationship with existing clients through delivery of add on and complementary products and services while continuing our gold standard commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs 
we believe that our growing customer base that is using our software on a daily basis is a strategic asset  and we intend to expand our product and service offerings towards this customer base in order to leverage this strategic asset 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  software development cost  intangible assets and 
table of contents self insurance accruals for reasonableness 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the significant accounting policies  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following table depicts the most critical accounting policies that affect our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition judgments and uncertainties we generate revenue from the sale of licensing rights to use our software products sold directly to end users and value added resellers  or vars 
we also generate revenue from sales of hardware and third party software  implementation  training  software customization  edi  post contract support maintenance and other services  including rcm services  performed for clients who license our products 
revenue from implementation and training services is recognized as the corresponding services are performed 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period 
rcm revenue is derived from services fees  which include amounts charged for ongoing billing and other related services and are generally billed to the client as a percentage of total collections 
we do not recognize revenue for services fees until these collections are made as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time 
a typical system contract contains multiple elements of the above items 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
the fair value of an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed quarterly or annually depending on the nature of the product or service 
the company has established vsoe for the related undelivered elements based on the bell shaped curve method 
maintenance vsoe for the company s largest clients is based on stated renewal rates only if the rate is determined to be substantive and falls within the company s customary pricing practices 
when evidence of fair value exists for the delivered and undelivered elements of a transaction  then discounts for individual elements are aggregated and the total discount is allocated to the individual elements in proportion to the elements fair value relative to the total contract fair value 
when evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements only  the residual method is used 
under the residual method  the company defers revenue related to the undelivered elements in a system sale based on vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements and allocates the remainder of the contract price net of all discounts to revenue recognized from the delivered elements 
if vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist  all revenue is deferred until vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered 

table of contents revenue recognition continued the company records accounts receivable for the entire system sales contract amount upon contract execution except for arrangements that provide for services to be billed as incurred 
amounts billed in excess of the amounts contractually due are recorded in accounts receivable as advance billings 
amounts are contractually due when services are performed or in accordance with contractually specified payment dates 
provided the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable  revenue from licensing rights and sales of hardware and third party software is generally recognized upon physical or electronic shipment and transfer of title 
in certain transactions where collection risk is high  the revenue is deferred until collection occurs or becomes probable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each period subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method 
fees which are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the company s arrangements must include the following characteristics thefee must be negotiated at the outset of an arrangement and generally be based on the specific volume of products to be delivered without being subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users  and paymentterms must not be considered extended 
if a significant portion of the fee is due more than months after delivery or after the expiration of the license  the fee is presumed not fixed or determinable 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts judgments and uncertainties we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we perform credit evaluations of our clients and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
reserves for potential credit losses are determined by establishing both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are based on management s estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts 
general reserves are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material 
software development costs judgments and uncertainties development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external use are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional external software development costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product  which is typically three years 
we perform an annual review of the estimated economic life and the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
if a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
goodwill judgments and uncertainties the company tests goodwill for impairment annually at the end of its first fiscal quarter  referred to as the annual test date  and has determined that there was no impairment to its goodwill as of june  the company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 

table of contents goodwill continued effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
as of march  and  we have not identified any events or circumstances that would require an interim goodwill impairment test 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
business combinations purchase price allocations judgments and uncertainties during the last three fiscal years  we completed four acquisitions in november  we acquired viatrack for million 
in july  we acquired cqi for million 
in april  we acquired intranexus for million 
in february  we acquired opus for million 
in accordance with the accounting for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 

table of contents business combinations purchase price allocations continued effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
intangible assets judgments and uncertainties intangible assets consist of trade names  customer relationships  and software technology  all is which arose in connection with the acquisition of sphere  opus  intranexus  cqi and viatrack 
these intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization 
the company currently amortizes the intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets  resulting in impairment charges that could be material 
we test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
share based compensation judgments and uncertainties our stock based compensation plans consist of stock options and restricted stock units 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
the company estimates the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
expected term is estimated using historical exercise experience 
volatility is estimated by using the weighted average historical volatility of the company s common stock  which approximates expected volatility 
the risk free rate is the implied yield available on the u 
s treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term 
the expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option 
those inputs are then entered into the black scholes model to determine the estimated fair value 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in the company s consolidated statements of income 
on may   the board of directors approved its fiscal year 
table of contents share based compensation continued equity incentive program for certain employees to be awarded options to purchase the company s common stock 
under the program  executives are eligible to receive options based on meeting certain target increases in eps performance and revenue growth during fiscal year non executive employees are also eligible to receive options based on satisfying certain management established criteria and recommendations of senior management 
the options shall be issued pursuant to one of the company s shareholder approved option plans  have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company s shares on the date of grant  a term of eight years and vesting in five equal annual installments commencing one year following the date of grant 
compensation expense associated with the performance based awards under the company s incentive plan are initially based on the number of options expected to vest after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met 
cumulative adjustments are recorded quarterly to reflect subsequent changes in the estimated outcome of performance related conditions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
self insured liabilities judgments and uncertainties effective january   we became self insured with respect to healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
we accrue for estimated self insurance costs and uninsured exposures based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported as of each balance sheet date 
however  it is possible that recorded accruals may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimated accruals resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in earnings during the periods in which such adjustments are determined 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 

table of contents overview of our results consolidated revenue increased and income from operations grew by in the year ended march  as compared to the prior year period 
revenue was positively impacted by growth in certain recurring revenue streams including maintenance and edi  as well as system sales revenue  which grew  and over the prior period  respectively 
other services revenue  which includes consulting and other add on services  grew compared to the prior year 
income from operations increased primarily from growth in both system sales and recurring revenue streams such as maintenance and edi 
this was partially offset by a higher selling  general and administrative expenses  which was primarily a result of increased headcount expenses and selling related expenses at the nextgen division  b increased research and development costs  c higher corporate related expenses and a slightly higher effective tax rate 
we have benefited and hope to continue to benefit from the increased demands on healthcare providers for greater efficiency and lower costs  financial incentives from the arra to physicians who adopt electronic health records  as well as increased adoption rates for electronic health records and other technology in the healthcare arena 
we also believe that healthcare reform and the movement towards pay for performance quality initiatives will also stimulate demand for robust enterprise electronic health record software as well 
while we expect to benefit from the increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as government support for increased adoption of electronic health records  the current economic environment  the increased adoption rates already achieved by large practices  combined with unpredictability of the federal government s plans to promote increased adoption of electronic medical records  makes the near term achievement of such benefits and  ultimately  their impact on system sales  uncertain 
the consolidation of healthcare providers by hospitals  payers  and large physician groups is creating both competitive threats as well as opportunities for our products 
hospital software providers are leveraging their position with their hospital customers to gain market share with hospital owned physician practices 
insurance providers and large physician groups are also consolidating physician offices creating additional opportunity for ambulatory software providers such as nextgen 
qsi dental division qsi dental division revenue decreased in the year ended march  and divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses decreased as compared to the same prior year period 
the decline is the result of higher selling  general and administrative expenses in the current period 
it should also be noted that the qsi dental division s new software solution nextdds is being sold as a saas solution where revenue is recognized over time rather than upfront 
revenue recognized from nextdds was not significant in the year ended march  additionally  our acquisition of viatrack in november did not significantly impact the qsi dental division results for the period 
the qsi dental division is well positioned to sell to the fqhcs market and intends to continue leveraging the nextgen division s sales force to sell its dental electronic medical records software to practices that provide both medical and dental services  such as fqhcs  which are receiving grants as part of the arra 
our goal for the qsi dental division is to maximize profit performance given the constraints represented by a relatively weak purchasing environment in the dental group practice market while taking advantage of opportunities with the new nextdds product 

table of contents nextgen division nextgen division revenue increased in the year ended march  and divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses increased as compared to the prior year period 
recurring revenue  which consists of maintenance and edi revenue  increased to million and accounted for of total nextgen division revenue for the year ended march  in the same period a year ago  recurring revenue of million represented of total nextgen division revenue 
during the year ended march   we added staffing resources and increased our investment in research and development in anticipation of growth from the arra and the future of healthcare reform and accountable care organizations 
our goals include taking maximum advantage of benefits related to the arra and continuing to further enhance our existing products  including continued efforts to maintain our status as a qualified vendor under the arra  integrating our inpatient and ambulatory software products  further development and enhancements of our portfolio of specialty focused templates within our ehr software  developing new products for targeted markets  continuing to add new clients  selling additional software and services to existing clients  expanding penetration of connectivity and other services to new and existing clients  and capitalizing on growth and cross selling opportunities within the rcm services division and the hospital solutions division 
the nextgen division s growth is attributed to a strong brand name and reputation within a growing marketplace for electronic health records and investments in sales and marketing activities  including new marketing campaigns  trade show attendance and other expanded advertising and marketing expenditures 
we have also benefited from winning numerous industry awards for the nextgen division s flagship nextgen ehr and nextgen pm software products and more recently in for its nextgen hie product 
further  the increasing acceptance of electronic records technology in the healthcare industry continues to provide growth opportunities 
hospital solutions division hospital solutions division revenue increased in the year ended march  and divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses increased to million as compared to million for the same prior year period 
this division consists of four acquisitions  cqi  intranexus  opus and sphere  acquired in july  april  february and august  respectively 
the hospital solutions division s core products consist of financial and clinical software which we acquired with the sphere  intranexus  and opus acquisitions 
our acquisition of cqi added surgery scheduling capability 
in may  we also announced the acquisition of the poseidon group  a developer of emergency department software 
this acquisition further adds to the division s offerings in the inpatient market 
the hospital solutions division has benefited from being able to offer both financial and cchit certified clinical software  which has been packaged together 
the hospital solutions division has also benefited from cross sell opportunities with existing nextgen division customers  including hospitals that are owned or affiliated with physician offices 
operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately of revenue in the year ended march  versus of revenue in the same prior year period primarily as a result of a million increase in divisional revenue  including system sales  implementation and training services  and maintenance 
we intend to continue to invest in implementation and training  support  and development to support our growing customer base 

table of contents rcm services division rcm services division revenue increased in the year ended march  and divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses increased to million as compared to million for the same prior year period 
the rcm services division benefited from organic growth achieved through cross selling rcm services to existing nextgen division clients and well as new clients added during the year ended march  the division also benefited from the cross sale of software and services to its existing customers 
systems sales to existing rcm services customers are credited to the division 
the company believes that a significant opportunity exists to cross sell revenue cycle management services to existing nextgen ambulatory customers 
the portion of existing the nextgen division s customers who are using the rcm services division s rcm services is less than 
there is also a significant opportunity to expand the rcm services division s services into the hospital solution division s customers as well 
management is actively pursuing efforts to achieve faster growth from expanded efforts to leverage the existing nextgen division s sales force towards selling revenue cycle management services 
operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately of revenue in the year ended march  versus of revenue in the same prior year period primarily as a result of higher rcm revenue as well as systems sales 
the same prior year period also included higher expenses related to certain non recurring integration related expenses related to integrating the two entities that make up the rcm services division  transitioning and training of staff on the nextgen platform  initial set up and other costs related to achieving higher production volume from a new business

the company s net income for the year ended march  was million  or per share on a basic and per share on a fully diluted basis 
in comparison  we earned million  or per share on both a basic and fully diluted basis for the year ended march  the increase in net income for the year ended march  was primarily attributed to the following a increase in consolidated revenue  including an increase in revenues of million from our nextgen division and million from our hospital solutions division  a increase in consolidated software license revenue  which accounted for of total system sales  
table of contents a increase in recurring revenue  including rcm  maintenance and edi revenue  offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development costs

system sales 
revenue earned from company wide sales of systems for the year ended march  increased to million from million in the prior year period 
our increase in revenue from sales of systems was principally the result of a increase in category revenue at our nextgen division and a increase at our hospital solutions division 
nextgen division sales in this category grew million to million during the year ended march  from million during the same prior year period while the hospital solutions division delivered a million increase in category revenue to million in the year ended march  as compared to million in the same prior year period 
the increases were driven by higher sales of software to both new and existing clients at the nextgen division and higher software and implementation revenue at the hospital solutions division

software license revenue continues to be an area of primary emphasis for the nextgen division 
hospital solutions division software license revenue increased in the year ended march  versus the same period last year 
the division s software revenue accounted for of divisional system sales revenue during the year ended march  compared to during the same period a year ago 

table of contents during the year ended march   of the nextgen division s system sales revenue was represented by hardware and third party software compared to during the same period a year ago 
the number of clients who purchase hardware and third party software and the dollar amount of hardware and third party software revenue fluctuates each period depending on the needs of clients 
the inclusion of hardware and third party software in the nextgen division s sales arrangements is typically at the request of our clients 
implementation and training revenue related to system sales at the nextgen division increased in the year ended march  compared to the same prior year period 
implementation and training revenue related to system sales at the hospital solutions division increased  in the year ended march  as compared to the same prior year period 
the amount of implementation and training services revenue is dependent on several factors  including timing of client implementations  the availability of qualified staff and the mix of services being rendered 
the number of implementation and training staff increased during the year ended march  versus the same prior year period in order to accommodate the increased amount of implementation services sold in conjunction with increased software sales 
in order to achieve growth in this area  additional staffing increases and additional training facilities are anticipated  though actual future increases in revenue and staff will depend upon the availability of qualified staff  business mix and conditions and our ability to retain current staff members 
for the rcm services division  total system sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended march  as compared to the same prior year period 
systems sales revenue within the rcm services division is composed of sales to existing rcm clients only and can fluctuate given the size of the current client base of the rcm services division 
maintenance  edi  rcm and other services 
for the year ended march   our company wide revenue from maintenance  edi  rcm and other services grew to million from million in the same prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in maintenance  edi and other services revenue from the nextgen and hospital solutions divisions 
total nextgen division maintenance revenue for the year ended march  grew to million from million for the same prior year period while nextgen division edi revenue grew to million compared to million in the same prior year period 
other services revenue for the nextgen division  which consists primarily of third party annual software license renewals  follow on training hours  consulting services and hosting services  increased to million in the year ended march  from million in the same prior year period 
other services revenue benefited from a strong increase in consulting revenue and follow on training services revenue to existing nextgen division customers 
the hospital solutions division maintenance and other services revenue for the year ended march  increased as compared to the same prior year period primarily due to a million increase in divisional maintenance revenue to million from million in the same prior year period 
maintenance revenue grew as a result of both new customers as well as the acquisitions of intranexus and cqi which brought additional maintenance revenue of million from their existing customers 
qsi dental division maintenance  edi and other services revenue for the year ended march  and was million and million  respectively 
for the year ended march   rcm revenue for the rcm services division grew million  or  to million compared to million in the same prior year period

the growth in maintenance revenue is primarily a result of increases related to net additional licenses from new clients and existing clients as well as a price increase that became effective during the quarter ended september  the nextgen division s edi revenue growth has come from new clients and from further penetration of the division s existing client base while the growth in rcm revenue has come from new clients that have been acquired from cross selling opportunities with the nextgen division client base 
we intend to continue to promote maintenance  edi and rcm services to both new and existing clients 
growth in other services revenue is primarily due to increases in third party annual software licenses  follow on training services  consulting services and hosting services revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million in the same prior year period and the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to from primarily due to a lower amount of hardware included in systems sales as compared to the same prior year period as well as strong software sales achieved in the current year period
