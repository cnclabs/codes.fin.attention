item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we currently operate primarily in two construction oriented industries light building products and heavy construction materials 
our third non core operating segment is in energy technology 
in the light building products segment  we design  manufacture  and sell manufactured architectural stone  exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents  concrete block and other building products 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
revenues in the heavy construction materials segment consist primarily of ccp product sales  including fly ash used as a partial replacement for portland cement in concrete  along with a smaller amount from services provided to coal fueled electric generating utilities relating to the disposal of ccps 
in the energy technology segment  we are focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy related feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
in the past  revenues for the energy technology segment consisted primarily of coal sales  however  in september we committed to a plan to sell our coal cleaning facilities and since then the coal cleaning business has been presented as a discontinued operation 
currently  continuing revenues for the energy technology segment consist primarily of catalyst sales to oil refineries 
operations and strategy 
we operate a variety of businesses in the light building products and heavy construction materials industries 
our construction oriented end markets include new residential  residential repair and remodeling  commercial  institutional and infrastructure 
we manufacture our light building products in approximately locations  selling our products primarily through wholesale distributors 
we have expanded our light building products segment margins through improved productivity and reduced indirect costs  resulting in a gross margin in of 
our heavy construction materials business sells fly ash as a partial substitute for portland cement directly to concrete manufacturers 
through continued improvements in operations  we achieved a gross margin in of 
during and  we developed the coal cleaning business in the energy technology segment  which is now classified as a discontinued operation 
as the economy deteriorated beginning in late  we focused on operational efficiency improvements and cost reductions  particularly in the light building products and heavy construction materials segments  in order to strengthen our balance sheet 
the emphasis on cost reductions culminated in a restructuring effort initiated in and completed in march  although cost control remains an area of ongoing focus 
light building products segment 
our light building products segment has been significantly affected for several years by the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
accordingly  we have significantly reduced operating costs to be positively positioned to take advantage of a sustained industry turnaround when it occurs 
although new housing construction continues to be substantially below the median for the last years  there has been some improvement in end markets recently 
demand for new homes is rising  although we still face an environment characterized by overly tight credit conditions which are 
table of contents constraining new building and purchases 
nevertheless  new residential construction starts improved over the prior year and as of september are at an annualized level of approximately million units 
existing home sales have also been trending up 
the national association of realtors reported that september total existing home sales were at a seasonally adjusted rate of million units  compared to million units during the same period a year earlier 
total housing inventory as of september  decreased to million existing homes for sale 
at the current sales rate  the september  inventory represents a month supply  an improvement from the month supply of homes that existed a year earlier 
the median sales price for existing homes of all types in september was up as compared to september we believe the following factors have resulted in positive momentum pent up household formations  rising consumer confidence  increased builder confidence and growing rental demand 
however  builders are facing a lack of credit availability  qualified buyers face difficulties obtaining mortgage loans  delinquent mortgages continue to result in foreclosures  and there is a limited inventory of developed lots 
we  like many others in the light building products industry  experienced a large drop in orders and a reduction in our margins in and relative to prior years 
in  and  we recorded significant goodwill impairments associated with our light building products business  although none of those impairment charges affected our cash position  cash flow from operating activities or debt covenant compliance 
weakness continued in through and still exists 
it is not possible to know when improved market conditions and a housing recovery will become sustainable and we can provide no assurances that improvements in our light building products markets will continue through or beyond 
while mortgage and home equity loan interest rates have decreased  volatility continues to exist in credit and equity markets  increased borrowing requirements prevent many potential buyers from qualifying for home mortgages and equity loans and there exists a continued lack of consumer confidence 
continued tightness of mortgage lending or mortgage financing requirements could adversely affect the availability of credit for purchasers of our products and thereby reduce our sales 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including the inability of prospective homebuyers or remodelers to obtain credit for financing the purchase of our building products 
these and other similar factors could continue to cause decisions to delay or forego new home construction or improvement projects  cause our customers to delay or decide not to purchase our building products  or lead to a decline in customer transactions and our financial performance 
heavy construction materials segment 
our business strategy in the heavy construction materials industry is to negotiate long term contracts with suppliers  supported by investment in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
demand for ccps is somewhat dependent on federal and state funding of infrastructure projects  which has decreased in recent years as compared to earlier periods 
we are continuing our efforts to expand the demand for high quality ccps  develop more uses for lower quality ccps  and expand our ccp disposal services and site service revenue generated from ccp management 
while all of our businesses have been affected by the recent recession  the impact on our heavy construction materials segment has been somewhat less severe than on our light building products segment 
however  to the extent that coal combustion power plant units are shut down or idled in the future  our business may be adversely affected 
energy technology segment 
we own and operate coal cleaning facilities that remove impurities from waste coal  resulting in higher value  marketable coal 
in  we assessed the strategic fit of our various operations and decided to divest certain businesses in the energy technology segment which do not align with our long term strategy 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan 
table of contents to sell the coal cleaning business and we currently expect to sell all  or substantially all  of the remaining business before the end of calendar during  and  many of our coal cleaning assets were idled or produced coal at low levels of capacity and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
as a result  we recorded asset impairments in those years  including an impairment charge in  to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value less estimated selling costs 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of the inputs in the cash flow models utilized to calculate the impairment charges  however  materially different input estimates and assumptions  including the probabilities of differing potential outcomes  would necessarily result in materially different calculations of expected future cash flows and asset fair values and materially different impairment estimates 
currently  continuing revenues for the energy technology segment consist primarily of catalyst sales 
in  we announced the decision by a refinery to commercially implement our hcat technology following a lengthy evaluation of the technology and we currently expect to have additional hcat customers in future years 
we continue to invest in research and development activities focused on energy related technologies and nanotechnology  but at decreased levels compared to earlier years 
through december   we participated in a joint venture that operates an ethanol plant located in north dakota 
we sold our interest in that joint venture effective january  we also participated in a joint venture that owns a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea  but we sold our interest in that joint venture in seasonality and weather 
both our light building products and our heavy construction materials segments are greatly impacted by seasonality 
revenues  profitability and ebitda are generally highest in the june and september quarters 
further  both segments are affected by weather to the extent it impacts construction activities 
debt and liquidity 
we became highly leveraged as a result of acquisitions consummated several years ago  but we reduced our outstanding debt significantly through by using cash generated from operations  from underwritten public offerings of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
from through  we made several early repayments of our long term debt and beginning in we renewed making early repayments as our business improved and free cash flow increased 
in  we issued senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used approximately million of the proceeds to repay all of our obligations under our former senior secured credit facility and our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes 
we also entered into a million asset based revolving loan facility abl revolver which is currently available but undrawn 
during and  we repaid most of our convertible senior subordinated notes and a large portion of our convertible senior subordinated notes  largely with proceeds from the sale of our interest in the south korean hydrogen peroxide joint venture and a federal income tax refund 
in  we again restructured our long term debt by issuing million of senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of those net proceeds to repay the senior secured notes issued in and the related early repayment premium of approximately million 
the senior secured notes mature in april while the notes were scheduled to mature in during  we repurchased million of our convertible senior subordinated notes and we also issued approximately million of new convertible senior subordinated notes due in february  in exchange for cancellation of an equal amount of outstanding notes due in february we have no debt maturities until capital expenditures in and were significantly lower than in prior years and this trend continued in this has allowed us to focus on liquidity and the early repayment of debt and has enabled us to continue implementing our overall operational strategy 
as of september   we 
table of contents have approximately million of cash on hand and total liquidity of approximately million 
additional cash flow is expected to be generated from operations over the next months 
in summary  our strategy for and subsequent years is to continue activities to improve operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs  continue capital expenditures at reduced levels and to pay down our outstanding debt to the extent possible using cash on hand  cash flow from operations and cash from the sale of non core assets 
we also may review strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand our current operating platform when opportunities arise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefit  over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the acquisition date fair value of identified assets  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill 
asc topic requires us to periodically test for goodwill impairment  at least annually  or sooner if indicators of possible impairment arise 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing as of june  using the one to three step process described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 
long lived assets other than goodwill are evaluated for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment arise 
we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying values of all long lived assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the estimated useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
no significant changes to estimated useful lives were made during the periods presented 
goodwill is tested primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
the carrying value of a long lived asset other than goodwill is considered impaired when the cumulative anticipated 
table of contents undiscounted cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a history of operating or cash flow losses  a decline in operating performance  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
material impairments of our light building products segment goodwill were recorded in years prior to and material impairments of our energy segment property plant and equipment were recorded in  and no material impairments of intangible assets have been recorded in any year 
it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that any resulting write downs could be material 
property  plant and equipment as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded significant asset impairments in our energy technology segment in  and  all related to our discontinued coal cleaning business 
many of our coal cleaning facilities were idled or produced coal at low levels of capacity and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
using assumptions in forecasts of future cash flows and other information  including offers of interest to acquire the assets from third parties  we determined that coal cleaning asset impairments existed and recorded non cash impairment charges aggregating approximately million in those years  including impairment charges in late and in to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value less estimated selling costs 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing expected future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of our coal cleaning assets  including future production levels  future coal prices  whether cleaned coal will be sold in the steam or metallurgical markets  the extent to which section tax credits will be earned and utilized in future periods  future operating margins  required capital expenditures  the extent  quality and productive lives of feedstock coal refuse reserves  and the potential relocation of facilities to more favorable sites or the sale of facilities  among other considerations 
following the sale of one coal cleaning facility in and two facilities in october  we have eight remaining facilities held for sale  two of which have been managed and operated as a single unit 
asc topic property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that an analysis for potential impairment be performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
for us  this means up to ten different asset groups were required to be analyzed  each of which has many unique operating and contractual features associated with it 
asc topic also indicates that when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset group are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows associated with the likely course of action  the likelihood of those possible outcomes shall be considered 
accordingly  for most operations a probability weighted approach was used in considering the likelihood of different potential outcomes 
while the coal cleaning business in its entirety has operated at a loss since inception several years ago  in  it was near breakeven from a cash flow perspective 
the business continued to operate at a loss in  and some facilities were idled or produced coal at low levels and had negative cash flows 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business 
following the sale of one facility  for which a gain of million was recognized  and all of the above described impairments  the carrying value of the coal cleaning property  plant and equipment held for sale has been written down to approximately million as of september  for the and early impairment tests  recent historical experience was the prevalent assumption driving the cash flow models 
for some operations  an eventual relocation of the facilities was considered a potential outcome  and for one operation  the sale of the facility was considered a 
table of contents potential outcome 
for the late and impairment tests  the assumptions included potential outcomes that all of the facilities would be sold 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of the fair value level inputs in the cash flow models utilized to estimate the impairments  including current and forecasted market prices of coal  inflation  useful lives of probable reserves  historical production levels  and offers of interest to acquire the assets from third parties 
materially different input estimates and assumptions  including the probabilities of differing potential outcomes  would necessarily result in materially different calculations of expected future cash flows and asset fair values and materially different impairment estimates 
if assumptions regarding future cash flows from the sale of the coal cleaning assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to record a loss or a gain when the remaining assets are sold 
in addition to the coal cleaning asset impairments described above  in we recorded an asset impairment totaling approximately million in the heavy construction materials segment related to a ccp loading facility that was not being utilized for fly ash shipments as originally planned 
goodwill all of the goodwill recorded in our light building products segment in years prior to was written off 
approximately million of segment goodwill existed as of september  and  all of which arose from small acquisitions consummated in and the heavy construction materials reporting unit had recorded goodwill of approximately million as of september  and  all of which related to acquisitions completed many years ago 
annual goodwill impairment tests performed subsequent to these acquisitions indicated no impairment for the heavy construction materials reporting unit for any test date  and accordingly  no impairment charges have been necessary for any period 
the estimated fair value of the heavy construction materials reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the june  test date by approximately million 
for the june  goodwill impairment test  we adopted the new accounting rules described in note to the consolidated financial statements  whereby companies may evaluate qualitative factors  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and cost factors  to determine whether it is necessary to perform step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
this qualitative evaluation is commonly referred to as step we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values exceeded the carrying amounts of goodwill for both the light building products and heavy construction materials reporting units 
accordingly  further step and step testing for impairment was not required to be performed 
in summary  for both reporting units  general industry trends are more positive than in recent prior years  and the overall financial performance of these reporting units has improved in as compared to for the prior years goodwill impairment tests  in determining the fair values of the reporting units all three of the traditional valuation approaches  the income approach  the market approach and the asset based approach  were considered 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using the income approach  determined by discounting expected future cash flows 
this method was chosen because it specifically considers the operations  opportunities and risks applicable to the reporting units 
the market approach  specifically the guideline public company method  was also considered 
however  the reporting units direct competitors are either subsets of large corporate entities or are privately held 
therefore  there was limited comparability between the reporting units and the potential guideline public companies 
accordingly  the guideline public company method was utilized only as a reasonableness test for the results from the income approach 
finally  the asset based approach was also considered  however  it was not utilized because it does not consider the income producing going concern nature of the reporting units assets 
as discussed above  the fair values of the reporting units are calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing these expected future cash flows  including most significantly the weighted average cost of capital used to 
table of contents discount future cash flows  anticipated long term growth rates  future profit margins  working capital requirements and required capital expenditures 
management uses its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of these and other inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  it is probable that actual results will differ from these estimates and the differences could be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions would necessarily result in materially different calculations of discounted expected future cash flows and reporting unit fair values and materially different goodwill impairment estimates 
based on currently available information and results of operations  management currently believes the likelihood of material goodwill impairments in the near future is remote 
income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments are routinely required in the calculation of our income tax provisions 
we utilized our and prior year federal net operating losses nols by carrying those amounts back to prior years  receiving significant income tax refunds in nols and tax credit carryforwards for were offset by our existing deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  in both and  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net amortizable deferred tax assets and recorded a minimal income tax benefit in and approximately million of income tax expense in  even though there were significant pre tax losses in both years 
the reported income tax rate for of near and the negative income tax rate of for were due to the combination of not recognizing benefit for pre tax losses and tax credits  but recognizing current state income taxes in certain state jurisdictions where we generated taxable income 
a valuation allowance is required when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
because the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future income in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that have generated losses  management determined that we do not meet the more likely than not threshold that nols  tax credits and deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is required 
in evaluating our ability to recover our recorded deferred tax assets  in full or in part  all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  is considered and evaluated 
in determining future taxable income  we utilize many assumptions  including amounts of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
in the years presented  section refined coal tax credits have been generated by coal cleaning facilities that we own and operate 
we believe it is more likely than not that a significant portion of the refined coal produced at our coal cleaning facilities qualifies for tax credits pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  notwithstanding the uncertainties and risks associated with the tax credits 
there are multiple bases upon which the irs may challenge the tax credits  including whether our facilities were placed in service for the purpose of producing refined coal  whether the facilities use waste coal as a feedstock  and whether the testing methods and certifications adequately demonstrate the required emissions reductions 
in addition  congress may modify or repeal section so that these tax credits may not be available in the future 
through september   we have earned total section income tax credits of approximately million  most of which has been carried forward as of september  as of september   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions and we currently have open tax years subject to examination by the irs or other taxing authorities for the years through we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will 
table of contents be due 
if events occur or do not occur as expected and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that approximately million to million of our unrecognized income tax benefits will be released within the next months  depending on the timing of ongoing examinations  the expiration of statute of limitation time periods and other factors 
litigation 
we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
in accounting for legal matters  we follow the guidance in asc topic contingencies  under which loss contingencies are accounted for based upon the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability 
if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  it is accrued 
if a loss contingency is probable but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is made 
if a loss contingency is reasonably possible  disclosure is made  including the potential range of loss  if determinable 
loss contingencies that are remote are neither accounted for nor disclosed 
we record legal fees associated with loss contingencies when incurred and do not record estimated future legal fees 
management uses outside legal counsel to assist in estimating the likelihood of the existence of liabilities with regard to all significant legal matters 
we incurred approximately million  million and million of expense for legal matters in  and  respectively 
historically  until  costs paid to outside legal counsel have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved legal matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a liability as of september  of million  of which million was incurred in and million was incurred in the substantial claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not currently deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel and management currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation beyond the amount accrued are neither probable nor remote 
accordingly  management cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount  if any  of our liability  nor is it possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
except as noted  the references to captions in the statements of operations refer to continuing operations only 

table of contents summary 
our total revenue for was million  up from million for gross profit increased  from million in to million in our operating income was million compared to an operating loss of million in  and the loss from continuing operations decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in our net loss including discontinued operations decreased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in there were several significant non routine adjustments recorded in  including approximately million of interest expense related to our senior debt refinancing of which approximately million was for the early repayment premium related to the repurchase of our senior secured notes  million of coal cleaning asset impairments recorded in loss from discontinued operations  million of restructuring costs  and million of litigation costs 
these adjustments and others are discussed in more detail below 
revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below  by segment 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
both our siding and stone product groups are benefiting from improvements in the new residential construction end markets  driving revenue growth from both price and volume increases 
we also believe that some of the product offerings from our siding and stone groups  in particular new products  have gained market share 
revenue in our concrete block product group declined in  primarily due to slower school construction in the texas market  but we are starting to see improvement in sales from new products  particularly products sold into retail channels  increasing our participation in residential construction 
in  we implemented a major restructuring initiative in the light building products segment that  along with other improvements in the business  positively impacted the gross margin  which increased to in from in the significant weakness in the new housing and residential remodeling markets which began several years ago appeared to ease somewhat in we believe our niche strategy and our focus on productivity improvements and cost reductions have tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in the housing market  however  it is not possible to know when improved market conditions and a housing recovery will become sustainable over the long term 
according to the national association of home builders  the most current and year averages for new housing starts were million and million units  respectively 
new housing starts were million units in both calendar and further  during the last years  the four years with the lowest number of housing starts were   and as of september  the seasonally adjusted annual number of new housing starts was million units 
our light building products business relies on the home improvement and remodeling market as well as new construction 
the us census bureau s value of private residential construction spending put in place data on homeowner improvement activity shows that the four quarter moving average peaked at billion in the second quarter of calendar  fell to a subsequent low of billion in the first quarter of calendar  then rose to billion in the second quarter of calendar  the latest quarter for which actual data is available 
the leading indicator of remodeling activity estimate issued by the joint center for housing studies at harvard university is that the four quarter moving average will be billion in the second quarter of calendar given our market leadership positions and reduced cost structure  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from a sustained recovery in the housing market when it occurs 
we believe the long term growth prospects in the industry are strong because the current seasonally adjusted annualized housing starts are still well below the and year averages 
also  according to a 
table of contents report by the harvard joint center for housing studies  household growth is projected to average million units a year from to heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
we experienced revenue growth in both ccp sales and in ccp services provided to utilities  as incremental revenue from new projects more than offset the effect of unplanned outages and lower electricity demand 
revenue increases were particularly strong in the central region of the country 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to improved product sales  product mix  and our continuous improvement efforts to lower costs 
it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of either cement consumption or cement prices  nor the correlation between cement usage and prices and fly ash sales and prices 
nevertheless  because fly ash is sold as a partial replacement for portland cement in a wide variety of concrete uses including infrastructure  commercial  and residential construction statistics and trends for portland and blended cement sales can be an indicator for fly ash sales 
according to the bureau of labor statistics  the producer price index for cement declined from september to september according to the portland cement association pca  cement consumption increased approximately in calendar in august  the pca s cement consumption forecast projected increases for calendar through ranging from to per year 
low natural gas prices and epa regulations  along with reduced power demand  have combined to force the long term shutdown or temporary idling of several coal combustion power plant units primarily older  smaller units  negatively impacting the supply of ccps for beneficial use in certain areas 
this trend  which is currently expected to continue in and beyond  has impacted somewhat our ccp supplies in certain regions of the country  however  we have multiple sources of supply and a broad distribution system  which allows us to backfill ccps in locations where power plant units have closed  creating an opportunity for potential growth 
relocating ccp supplies can increase our transportation costs  some but not all of which we have historically been able to pass on to customers 
in june  the epa proposed two alternative rules to regulate ccps generated by electric utilities and independent power producers 
one proposed option would classify ccps disposed of in surface impoundments or landfills as special wastes subject to federal hazardous waste regulation under subtitle c of the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the second proposed option would instead regulate ccps as non hazardous waste under subtitle d of rcra  with states retaining the lead authority on regulating their handling  storage and disposal 
under both options  the current exemption from hazardous waste regulation for ccps that are used for beneficial purposes would remain in effect 
however  the epa has received comments on refining the definition of beneficial uses subject to the exemption  which could result in a narrowing of the scope of exempt uses in the final rule to certain encapsulated uses 
both rule options are controversial 
in april  the us house of representatives passed a short term extension of existing transportation funding  creating an opportunity to hold a conference with the us senate  which had previously passed a new transportation bill 
the house added its fly ash bill to the short term transportation extension  resulting in fly ash disposal legislation also moving to conference with the senate 
however  the fly ash language was not added to the final transportation bill 
during the september quarter  the senate introduced a bipartisan legislative solution to the disposal of fly ash  including a federal standard that would be administered by the states 
the senate bill has democrat and republican co sponsors  indicating that there could be senators supporting the legislation when it comes up for a vote 
it is now important to identify a legislative vehicle to which the fly ash disposal language can be attached  providing congress an opportunity to resolve the regulatory uncertainty caused by the epa in a bipartisan  environmentally sound manner 

table of contents as part of its response to deadline litigation initiated by environmental organizations  the epa formally stated that it requires more time to evaluate proposed fly ash disposal regulations 
in its recent court filing  the epa indicated that it does not expect to propose final regulations until  at the earliest 
based on the timetable set by the epa  we do not currently anticipate any significant developments in the near term unless action is required by the courts 
finally  the epa has not completed its risk evaluation methodology for encapsulated beneficial use of fly ash 
when the risk evaluation methodology is complete  we believe that the epa may apply it to fly ash concrete and synthetic gypsum wallboard  two examples of encapsulated products  confirming the historical consensus that there is no environmental exposure associated with the use of coal combustion products in these applications 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the form that potential legislation or final regulations will take 
either of the proposed options proposed by the epa is likely to increase the complexity and cost of managing and disposing of ccps 
if the epa decides to regulate ccps as hazardous waste under rcra subtitle c  ccps would become subject to a variety of regulations 
regulation of ccps as hazardous waste would likely have an adverse effect on beneficial use and sales of ccps and our relationships with utilities 
there can be no guarantee that such regulations would not reduce fly ash supplies or our ability to market fly ash and other ccps for certain uses  which would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
energy technology segment 
energy technology segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
following the decision to sell the coal cleaning business in and the sale of our interest in the blue flint ethanol plant in  our energy technology segment currently consists primarily of operations related to our heavy oil upgrading catalyst 
in  catalyst sales were lower than in primarily due to reduced usage at one of our customer facilities and the timing of shipments 
operating expenses  including restructuring costs 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in from due to assets that have been fully amortized 
research and development expenses increased approximately million from to  primarily due to changes in long term incentive compensation expense tied in part to changes in our stock price 
the stock price increased during  but decreased during selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in litigation expense recognized in as compared to  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and cost reductions initiated in late  largely offset by increased performance based compensation in which increased by more than million over due to compensation which is tied to improved performance and changes in our stock price 
in  we recorded million of restructuring costs as a result of actions taken in to lower operating costs and improve operational efficiency  primarily in the light building products segment  all as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring was initiated in primarily due to the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
this restructuring effort was completed in the march quarter and no additional restructuring costs related to the actions have been incurred since that time 
other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the decrease of million was comprised of a decrease in net interest expense of approximately million and a decrease in net other income increase in net other expense of approximately million 

table of contents net interest expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to approximately million of premium related to the early retirement of our senior secured notes plus approximately million of accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs associated with that early repayment  along with approximately million of reduced interest expense from the lower rate senior debt outstanding in as compared to the higher rate senior debt outstanding for most of  all as described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
absent interest expense related to any early retirements of long term debt in  interest expense in is currently expected to total approximately million 
the decrease in net other income increase in net other expense of million was primarily the result of approximately million of income in related to our equity interest in the blue flint joint venture compared to approximately of expense in including a loss on sale of approximately million plus a loss of approximately million related to another joint venture  partially offset by a gain of million from the early repayments of convertible debt in income tax provision 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the minimal amount of income tax benefit recognized in and the negative effective income tax rate for  including the reasons for recording a full valuation allowance on net operating losses  tax credits and other deferred tax assets in both years 
we currently expect to record a full valuation allowance on our net amortizable deferred tax assets until some point in time after our return to profitability 
discontinued operations 
coal sales of million in were lower than sales of million in due primarily to a curtailment of operations pending the sale of the coal cleaning assets 
due to low capacity utilization  idled facilities and feedstock issues  the cost of revenue and operating expenses for the coal cleaning business exceeded revenues in both years 
in addition  we recorded million of impairments of the coal cleaning assets in and a million impairment in we sold one coal cleaning facility in  recognizing a gain of approximately million  and sold two additional facilities in october we continue to negotiate with prospective purchasers of the coal cleaning facilities and currently expect to sell all  or substantially all  of the remaining discontinued coal cleaning business before the end of calendar it is currently expected that some losses will be incurred in operating and maintaining the coal cleaning facilities until such time as they are sold  however  it is not currently possible to know when the facilities will be sold  or what the losses might be until that time

year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
except as noted  the references to captions in the statements of operations refer to continuing operations only 
summary 
our total revenue for was million  down from million for gross profit decreased  from million in to million in our operating loss was million compared to operating income of million in  and the loss from continuing operations increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in our net loss including discontinued operations increased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in there were several significant non routine adjustments recorded in  including approximately million of asset impairments and restructuring charges  
table of contents million of accrued legal costs related to ongoing legal matters  and million of interest expense related to our senior debt refinancing of which approximately million was for the early repayment premium relating to the repurchase of the senior secured notes in march 
in addition  in  we did not recognize income tax benefits attributable to our pre tax operating losses and tax credits as we have in prior years 
these adjustments and others are discussed in more detail below 
revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below  by segment 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in our sales of light building products in was due primarily to a weather related slow start to the construction season 
the gross margin decreased primarily because of increases in transportation  materials especially siding accessories and production costs 
cost increases impacted all of our major product lines  most notably our manufactured architectural stone and siding accessories categories 
the significant weakness in the new housing and residential remodeling markets which began several years ago continued during we believe our niche strategy and our focus on productivity improvements and cost reductions tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in the housing market  however  the recession resulted in high unemployment  adding to the high level of home foreclosures  putting additional homes on the market and further reducing the demand for new construction 
heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
the decrease in heavy construction materials revenues in compared to was due primarily to lower service revenues in  caused by the completion of certain one time projects 
the decline in revenue and higher transportation costs were the primary drivers of the lower gross margin in than in energy technology segment 
energy technology segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for both years consisted primarily of catalyst sales 
sales of our proprietary hcat hydrocracking technology catalyst increased due to continued use at two refineries 
operating expenses  including asset impairments and restructuring costs 
amortization expenses were materially consistent from to research and development expenses decreased approximately million from to  primarily due to decreased spending on our coal to liquids and hydrogen peroxide technologies in the energy segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  to million in from million in the increase in was due primarily to the million accrual for litigation expense recognized during see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the million of litigation expenses  our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  or  from to this decrease was attributable primarily to lower incentive compensation expenses in and lower professional services expenses  particularly million of non routine costs that were expensed in for consultations related to recapitalization transactions that occurred in and other periods 
in  we recorded an approximate million impairment charge for assets related to a ccp loading facility that was not being utilized for fly ash shipments as originally planned 
in  we recorded approximately million of restructuring costs as a result of actions taken to lower operating costs and improve operational efficiency  primarily in the light building products segment 

table of contents the charges consisted of workforce reductions and related severance expenses  facility closures and consolidations  and certain asset impairments and write downs  as reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring effort was initiated primarily due to the ongoing depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the increase in net other expense of million was comprised of an increase in net interest expense of approximately million plus a decrease in net other income of approximately million 
net interest expense increased from million in to million in  due primarily to approximately million of premium relating to the early retirement of our senior secured notes plus approximately million of accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs associated with that early repayment  all as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these increases in interest expense related to the senior debt refinancing were partially offset by the lower rate senior debt which was outstanding for part of as compared to  lower interest on reduced balances of convertible debt in  and decreased premiums and accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs related to early retirements of convertible debt in the decrease in net other income of million was primarily the result of reduced equity earnings from our joint venture investments in an ethanol plant located in north dakota million in and million in and a hydrogen peroxide plant in south korea which was sold in late million in  including a million gain on the sale of our equity interest  and in 
income tax provision 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the near income tax benefit recorded in and the income tax benefit recorded in  including the reasons for recording a full valuation allowance on net operating losses  tax credits and other deferred tax assets in discontinued operations 
coal sales of million in were lower than sales of million in primarily due to a decrease in tons sold at some facilities 
due to feedstock issues  low capacity utilization and idled facilities  the cost of revenue related to the coal cleaning business exceeded revenues in both and during the september quarter  the coal cleaning facilities operated at of aggregate capacity 
in addition to the losses from operations incurred in both years  asset impairments of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
largely due to the increased impairment charges in compared to  along with the million income tax provision recorded in as compared to the million tax benefit recorded in  there was a significant increase in the loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  to million in from million in reference is made to the sections titled overview and critical accounting policies and estimates valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill for more background about the presentation of the coal cleaning business as a discontinued operation and for a detailed description of the procedures and estimates used in calculating an impairment 
impact of inflation and related matters in certain periods  some of our operations have been negatively impacted by increased raw materials costs for commodities such as polypropylene and poly vinyl chloride in the light building products segment 
during and  we experienced some significant cost increases for certain raw materials and transportation fuel 
we currently believe it is possible that costs for raw materials and other commodities such as fuels  along with the prices of other goods and services  could continue to 
table of contents increase in future periods 
we have passed through certain increased raw materials costs to customers  but it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of these costs  nor our ability to pass on future price increases 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended september  was million  compared to net cash used in operating activities during the year ended september  of million 
the large net loss in was due primarily to three non routine adjustments i million of asset impairments and restructuring costs  ii million for a litigation accrual  and iii million of interest expense related to our march senior debt refinancing 
only a small amount of the asset impairments and restructuring costs and none of the litigation accrual involved cash outlays  but nearly all of the interest expense did involve the use of cash  which was the most significant reason for the million use of cash for operations in other reasons for the positive change in net cash from operating activities in compared to include operating results that were better than operating results and a large increase in accrued personnel costs in  representing performance based compensation expense that did not involve the use of cash during the year 
in both years  our primary investing activity consisted of the purchase of property  plant and equipment and payments for acquisitions 
in  we also received approximately million of proceeds from the sale of our interest in an equity method investee 
in  our primary financing activity was the march senior debt refinancing  and in our primary financing activity consisted of repayments of our long term convertible debt 
more details about these and other investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
in  total expenditures for property  plant and equipment and payments for acquisitions were million  a decrease of million from in both years  a majority of capital expenditures related to the maintenance of operating capacity in our light building products segment  with a smaller proportion related to more discretionary expenditures for new product lines or projects 
total capital expenditures are currently expected to be near the and levels 
as of september   we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
funding for capital expenditures is expected to come from working capital 
in and  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of some small privately held companies in the light building products industry 
as noted earlier  we assessed the strategic fit of our various operations and are pursuing divestiture of certain businesses in the energy technology segment which do not align with our long term strategy 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business and we sold one coal cleaning facility during for cash proceeds of million plus potential future consideration totaling approximately million  which amount would be received over a number of years  depending upon future plant production levels 
we sold two additional facilities in october for consideration to be received in the future  primarily in the form of production royalties  totaling an amount which could exceed million  which amount would be received over a number of years  depending upon future plant production levels 
we continue to negotiate with prospective purchasers of the coal cleaning facilities and currently expect to sell all  or substantially all  of the remaining discontinued coal cleaning business before the end of calendar at the current time  it is not possible to predict the amount of cash we will realize upon sale of the coal cleaning business nor the amount of cash we will expend operating and maintaining the facilities until such time as they are sold 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations in our core light and heavy building materials businesses 
acquisitions have historically been an important part of 
table of contents our long term business strategy  however  primarily because of debt covenant restrictions  cash flow considerations and events affecting the debt and equity markets  we have not made any large acquisitions since we have also invested in joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting  one of which was sold in and one of which was sold in proceeds of approximately million were received in related to the sale 
we do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in any of the remaining joint venture entities  none of which is material 
current debt agreements limit potential acquisitions and investments in joint ventures 
during the five year term of the abl revolver  our acquisitions and investments in joint ventures and other less than owned entities are limited to total cumulative consideration of million and million annually 
financing activities 
in march  we issued million of senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of the net proceeds to repay the former senior secured notes and the related early repayment premium of approximately million which premium was charged to interest expense 
the march refinancing accomplished several objectives  the most important of which was to extend the maturity of our senior debt 
in  we issued approximately million of new convertible senior subordinated notes in exchange for cancellation of an equal amount of outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes  plus a cash payment of approximately million 
the unamortized balances of debt discount and debt issue costs related to the million of retired notes  aggregating approximately million  were written off and charged to interest expense 
the notes have a maturity date of february  two years after the maturity date of the notes  which extended maturity date was the primary reason for issuing the notes 
the maturity date for the notes better matches our projected generation of free cash flow 
other than the different interest rate and two year extended maturity date  the terms of the notes are similar in all material respects to the terms of the notes as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we repurchased and canceled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes for cash consideration of approximately million in several different transactions 
terms of repayment for some of these transactions included premiums totaling approximately million  which were charged to interest expense 
for certain other transactions  gains totaling approximately million were recognized and recorded in other income 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were charged to interest expense 
in  we repurchased and canceled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior subordinated notes 
terms of repayment included premiums totaling approximately million  which were recorded in interest expense 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were also charged to interest expense 
following all of the above described transactions  we now have no debt maturities until and believe our cash flow will be sufficient to repay maturing debt on or before the due dates 
debt reduction remains a high priority 
we currently plan to continue our program of early convertible debt repayment as opportunities arise  depending on future cash flow and as deemed appropriate by our management and board of directors 
following certain asset sales  as defined  we could be required to prepay a portion of the senior secured notes 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  the senior secured notes and abl revolver limit the incurrence of additional debt and liens on assets  prepayment of future subordinated debt  merging or consolidating with another company  selling all or substantially all assets  making capital expenditures  making acquisitions and investments and the payment of dividends or distributions  among other things 
in addition  if availability under the abl revolver is less than of the total million commitment  or million currently  we are required to maintain a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of at least x for the preceding twelve month period 

table of contents there have been no borrowings under the abl revolver since it was entered into in october the abl revolver has a termination date of october  with a contingent provision for early termination three months prior to the earliest maturity date of the senior secured notes or any of the convertible senior subordinated notes currently november  at which time any amounts borrowed must be repaid 
the contingent provision for early termination is precluded if  three months prior to any note maturity date  borrowing base capacity under the abl revolver and or cash collateral is at least equivalent to the notes maturing on such date 
availability under the abl revolver cannot exceed million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
availability under the abl revolver is further limited by the borrowing base valuations of the assets of our light building products and heavy construction materials segments which secure the borrowings  currently consisting of certain trade receivables and inventories 
in addition to the first lien position on these assets  the abl revolver lenders have a second priority position on substantially all other assets 
as of september   availability under the abl revolver was approximately million 
however  due primarily to the seasonality of our operations  the amount of availability varies from period to period and  while not currently expected  it is possible that the availability under the abl revolver could fall below the threshold  or million  in a future period 
as of september   our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the abl revolver agreement  is approximately the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing ebitdar minus capital expenditures and cash payments for income taxes by fixed charges 
ebitdar consists of net income loss i plus net interest expense  income taxes as defined  depreciation and amortization  non cash charges such as goodwill and other impairments  and rent expense  ii plus or minus other specified adjustments such as equity earnings or loss in joint ventures 
fixed charges consist of cash payments for debt service plus rent expense 
if availability under the abl revolver were to decline below million at some future date and the fixed charge coverage ratio were to also be below  the abl revolver lender could issue a notice of default 
if a notice of default were to become imminent  we would seek an amendment to the abl revolver  or alternatively  a waiver of the availability requirement and or fixed charge coverage ratio for a period of time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed descriptions of the terms of our long term debt and our abl revolver 
in february  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which million is available for future offerings of securities 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering could commence under the registration statement 
working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million including million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million as of september  we currently expect operations to produce positive cash flow during and in future years 
we also currently believe working capital will be sufficient for our operating needs for the next months  and that it will not be necessary to utilize borrowing capacity under the abl revolver for our seasonal operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 
income taxes 
cash outlays for income taxes were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
we utilized our and prior year federal nols by carrying those amounts back to prior years  receiving significant income tax refunds in nols and tax credit carryforwards for were offset by our existing deferred income tax liabilities resulting in a near deferred tax position as of september  in both and  we recorded a full valuation allowance on our net amortizable deferred tax assets and recorded a minimal income tax benefit in and approximately million of income tax expense in as of september   our nol and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately million tax effected 
the us and state nols and capital losses expire from to substantially all of the non us nols  which 
table of contents are not material  do not expire 
in addition  there are approximately million of tax credit carryforwards as of september   which expire from to we do not currently expect cash outlays for income taxes during the next months to be significant 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant cash requirements for the next months  beyond seasonal operational working capital requirements  consist primarily of interest payments on long term debt and capital expenditures 
in subsequent periods  significant cash requirements will also include the repayment of debt  but not prior to february reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements where the potential risks of litigation are described in detail 
adverse conclusions to those legal matters could involve material amounts of cash outlays in future periods 
legal matters we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting for legal costs and for other information about legal matters 
off balance sheet arrangements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have operating leases for certain facilities and equipment 
other than operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital resources 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingent liabilities the following table presents a summary by period of our contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by fiscal year in millions total after senior secured notes convertible senior subordinated notes total long term debt interest payments on long term debt unconditional purchase obligations operating lease obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have no borrowings under our abl revolver as of september  the abl revolver provides for potential borrowings of up to million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized income tax benefits  including million of potential interest and penalties 
due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made beyond amounts currently accrued  nor can we reliably estimate the timing of any potential payments

amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of those agreements  depending upon the outcomes of the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we have recorded a liability of million as of september  for all legal matters  however  it is not possible to know what amounts will ultimately be paid  nor the time periods any such payments will occur and accordingly  no amounts for legal matters have been included in the above table 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to our stock price 
in addition  future borrowings  if any  under our abl revolver will bear interest at a variable rate  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
through december   we were also exposed to market risks related to the activities of one of our joint ventures  the blue flint joint venture  which had derivatives in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our interest in that joint venture effective january  cash performance unit awards 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the compensation committee approved grants of performance unit awards to certain officers and employees in the corporate business unit  to be settled in cash  based on the achievement of goals related to consolidated cash flow generated in the second half of during  we recorded approximately million of expense for the performance unit awards due to an increase in the average day stock price between september  and september  also as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the compensation committee approved grants of performance unit awards to certain officers and employees in the corporate business unit  to be settled in cash  based on the achievement of goals related to consolidated cash flow generated during during  we recorded approximately million of expense for the performance unit awards  calculated based on the consolidated cash flow achieved for the year and an increase in the stock price between september  and september  subsequent to september   the committee approved grants of performance unit awards to participants in certain business units related to consolidated cash flow generated during  again with terms similar to those for the and awards 
changes in our cash flow generation as well as changes in the stock price through september  will result in adjustment of the expected liability as of september   which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter through september  changes in the stock price can result in an increase or decrease in the estimated september  payout liability  however  any adjustments are also dependent upon the amount of cash flow generated during 
table of contents cash settled sar grants 
in  the committee approved grants to certain employees of approximately million cash settled sars  approximately million of which are currently outstanding 
these sars vest in annual installments through september   provided the participant is still employed at the respective vest dates  and are settled in cash upon exercise by the employee 
the sars terminate on september  and must be exercised on or before that date 
as of september   million has been accrued for these awards because the stock price at september  was above the grant date stock price of 
future changes in our stock price in any amount beyond through september  will result in adjustment to the expected remaining liability  which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter 
during  the committee approved grants to certain officers and employees of approximately million cash settled sars  with terms similar to those described above 
approximately million has been accrued for these awards as of september  changes in our stock price in any amount beyond the grant date stock price of through september  will result in adjustment to the expected remaining liability  which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter 
if all of the above described sars ultimately vest and the stock price is above the grant date stock prices  a change in the stock price of would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the ultimate payout liability
