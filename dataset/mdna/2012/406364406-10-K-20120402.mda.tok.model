any failure by brookwood to pay dividends or tax sharing payments to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a holding company  the company is dependent on brookwood to receive the cash necessary to fund its ongoing operations and its obligations 
at december   the company had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents of which  was used in february to settle the hallwood energy litigation  except the adversary proceeding  as discussed in item legal proceedings

table of contents brookwood s ability to pay dividends and tax sharing payments or make advances to the company is contingent upon brookwood s compliance with loan covenants and other factors 
brookwood s ability to pay dividends and tax sharing payments or make advances to the company are contingent upon brookwood s compliance with the loan covenants in the new revolving credit facility with bb t and are limited in amount by terms of the loan agreement 
this limitation could adversely affect the company if these payments were restricted 
additionally  any payment of a dividend  tax sharing payment or advance to the company by brookwood is dependent on a number of other factors  including approval of brookwood s board of directors  brookwood s ability to meet the requirements of the delaware corporate laws for payment of dividends  and compliance with other applicable laws and requirements 
in addition  a significant adverse judgment against brookwood in the nextec applications  inc litigation matter see item legal proceedings could adversely affect brookwood s ability to make payments or advances to the company 
as a result  no assurance can be given that these amounts will be available when needed or required 
litigation and costs related thereto could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is involved in certain litigation matters  as described in item legal proceedings  and the court in the adversary proceeding described in that item has issued proposed findings proposing that the united states district court award damages against the company totaling approximately  plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest and attorneys fees as may be requested and awarded pursuant to a subsequent motion 
the proposed findings including the proposed monetary awards are not final 
the company and each of the other parties has objected to various aspects of the proposed findings to the united states district court  which will review the portions to which objections have been raised on a de novo basis 
the company intends to vigorously defend against the entry of any final judgment and would likely appeal any adverse final judgment to the extent it is able 
the ability to appeal any adverse final judgment would be dependent on a number of factors  including the ability to post a bond in connection with the appeal of such judgment 
see any failure by brookwood to pay dividends or tax sharing payments to the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company does not currently have sufficient cash  directly or through brookwood  to pay the amount of the damages proposed in the proposed findings 
payment by the company of a significant judgment based on the proposed findings  if ultimately required  would have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
the company s insurance carrier for its directors and officers liability policy has also been released from any obligation it may have had to make any payments toward the resolution of the adversary proceeding 
the company s ability to meet in cash a final judgment arising out of the proposed findings  including any requirement to post any supersedeas bond to appeal any such judgment or any agreed to cash settlement  would be dependent on the company s then available cash and its ability to receive cash dividends or other advances from brookwood 
see brookwood s ability to pay dividends and tax sharing payments or make advances to the company is contingent upon brookwood s compliance with loan covenants and other factors above 
to pay any such cash dividends or advances to the company above the permitted annual discretionary dividend not to exceed of brookwood s net income  brookwood has indicated that it would be required pursuant to the terms of the new revolving credit facility to obtain consent from bb t for such payments 
the new revolving credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to  of which  was utilized at april  brookwood has not requested bb t to approve any such payments and does not intend to do so unless and until requested by the company and approved by brookwood s board of directors 
any such payments or advances would also be contingent upon brookwood s ability to meet the requirements of the delaware corporate laws for the payment of dividends and compliance with other applicable laws and requirements 
if for any reason brookwood is unable to pay a cash dividend or other advance to the company  the company would be required to seek alternative sources of funding 
the company has not yet determined what  if any  sources would be available to it  but will consider such alternatives as an additional or new facility or term loan and potential sales of assets or additional securities 
no assurance can be given that any such additional sources of funding will be available to the company 
although the company does not believe that the results of the other litigation matters  other than the adversary proceeding  are likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows  it is possible that any of the litigation matters  could result in material liability 
risks related to our textile products business the company s textile products business may be affected by the following risk factors  each of which could adversely affect the company 
brookwood depends upon a limited number of third party suppliers for raw materials 
brookwood purchases a significant 
table of contents amount of the fabric and other materials it processes and sells from a small number of suppliers 
brookwood believes that the loss of any one of its direct suppliers would not have a long term adverse effect because other manufacturers with which brookwood conducts business would be able to fulfill those requirements 
however  the loss of certain of brookwood s suppliers could  in the short term  adversely affect brookwood s business until alternative supply arrangements were secured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any new supply arrangements would have terms as favorable as those contained in current supply arrangements 
some of brookwood s suppliers are entering the military markets in competition to brookwood  targeting specific military specifications 
however  there has been no material effect upon brookwood s business relationship to date 
as of march   brookwood has not experienced any significant disruptions in supply as a result of shortages in fabrics or other materials from its suppliers 
the loss of one or more of brookwood s key customers could result in a significant loss of revenues 
brookwood has two customers who accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in one or more of the three years ended december  sales to one brookwood customer  tennier industries  inc tennier  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in each of the three years ended december  brookwood s relationship with tennier is ongoing 
sales to tennier  which are included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
sales to another customer  orc industries  inc orc  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in brookwood s relationship with orc is ongoing 
sales to orc  which are also included in military sales  were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
military sales were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
generally  military sales represent sales of a product to a customer prime and sub prime contractors that will be incorporated into an end product that will be used to fulfill a us or international military contract 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial revenues from its military business  there is no assurance that such revenues will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend management believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the activity of the us military 
if activity changes  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
changes in military procurement practices or regulations could adversely affect brookwood s business 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in significant military sales 
changes in specifications  procurement entity budgets  or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications  budgetary and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market is highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
management acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
global capital and credit market conditions could have an adverse effect on brookwood s business  operating results and financial condition 
brookwood maintains factoring agreements with several factors  which provide that receivables resulting from credit sales to customers  excluding the us government  may be sold to the factor  subject to a commission and the factor s prior approval 
the amount of receivables that brookwood can factor is subject to certain limitations as specified in individual factoring agreements 
the factoring agreements expose brookwood to credit risk if any of the factors fail to meet their obligations 
brookwood seeks to manage this risk by conducting business with a number of reputable factors and monitoring the factors performance under their agreements 
brookwood continues to monitor its factors and their ability to fulfill their obligations to brookwood in a timely manner 
as of march   all of brookwood s factors were complying with payment terms in accordance with factor agreements 
brookwood s ability to comply with its new revolving credit facility is subject to future performance and other factors 
brookwood s new revolving credit facility with bb t  entered into on march   requires compliance with various loan covenants and financial ratios on a quarterly basis  principally i a ratio of total current assets to the sum of total current liabilities and the outstanding loan balance of not less than to  ii a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than to  and iii a ratio of funded debt as defined to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the trailing four quarters of not greater than to 

table of contents brookwood was in compliance with its principal loan covenants on its former working capital revolving credit facility as of december   and and for all interim periods  except one as discussed below  during those years 
due to a decline in military sales for the first quarter  brookwood was unable to meet the financial covenant that requires income before taxes of at least in each quarter 
brookwood s unaudited loss before taxes for the first quarter was  accordingly  in may  brookwood requested and received a waiver from keybanc for the income covenant for the first quarter 
brookwood received an increased level of military orders in late march and into the subsequent periods  and reported income before taxes in excess of in the second quarter  third quarter and fourth quarter  respectively  and was in compliance with its loan covenants for the three remaining quarters 
if brookwood does not comply with its loan covenants for any quarter  under the new revolving credit facility  the bank may require payment of outstanding amounts and prohibit cash dividends and tax sharing payments by brookwood to the company 
brookwood would have been in compliance with the loan covenants of the new revolving credit facility at december   if they had been in effect at such date 
brookwood is subject to many environmental regulations that may result in significant costs or liabilities or cause interruptions in its operations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are subject to a broad range of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the pollution and protection of the environment 
among the many environmental requirements applicable to kenyon and brookwood laminating are laws relating to air emissions  ozone depletion  wastewater discharges and the handling  disposal and release of solid and hazardous substances and wastes 
based on continuing internal review and advice from independent consultants  kenyon and brookwood laminating believe that they are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are also subject to such laws as the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla  that may impose liability retroactively and without fault for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at on site or off site locations 
kenyon and brookwood laminating are not aware of any releases for which they may be liable under cercla or any analogous provision 
actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could increase the cost of producing the products manufactured by kenyon and brookwood laminating or otherwise adversely affect demand for their products 
widespread adoption of any prohibitions or restrictions could adversely affect the cost and or the ability to produce products and thereby have a material adverse effect upon kenyon  brookwood laminating or brookwood 
brookwood does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of its efforts to comply with environmental requirements 
some risk of environmental liability is inherent  however  in the nature of brookwood s business 
there can be no assurance that material environmental liabilities will not arise 
it is also possible that future developments in environmental regulation could lead to material environmental compliance or cleanup costs 
brookwood s business could lose a significant competitive advantage if it fails to adequately protect its intellectual property rights 
brookwood considers its patents and trademarks  in the aggregate  to be important to its business and seeks to protect this proprietary know how in part through u 
s 
patent and trademark registrations 
no assurance can be given  however  that such protection will give brookwood any material competitive advantage 
in addition  brookwood maintains certain trade secrets for which  in order to maintain the confidentiality of such trade secrets  it has not sought patent or trademark protection 
as a result  such trade secrets could be infringed upon and such infringement could have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations  financial condition or competitive position 
in july  nextec applications inc filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york claiming that brookwood infringed five united states patents pertaining to internally coated webs 
nextec later added additional patents to the lawsuit 
after a number of motions  only two patents remain in the action and are being asserted against the process and machine for making certain fabrics 
brookwood intends to vigorously defend against all remaining claims 
trial on this matter is currently scheduled to begin on april  refer to item legal proceedings for a further description of this lawsuit 
the strength of brookwood s competitors may impact its ability to maintain and grow sales  which could decrease revenues 
the cyclical nature of the textile and apparel industries  characterized by rapid shifts in military procurement  fashion and consumer demand and competitive pressures  results in both price and demand volatility 
the demand for any particular product varies from time to time based largely upon changes in military specifications  consumer and industrial preferences  and general economic conditions affecting the textile and apparel industries  such as consumer expenditures for non durable goods 
the textile and apparel industries are also cyclical because the supply of particular products changes as competitors enter or leave the market 
brookwood sells primarily to domestic manufacturers  some of which operate offshore sewing operations 
some of 
table of contents brookwood s customers have moved their business offshore 
brookwood has responded by shipping fabric asia to asia and also by supplying finished products directly to manufacturers 
brookwood competes with numerous domestic and foreign fabric manufacturers  including companies larger in size and having greater financial resources than brookwood 
the principal competitive factors in the woven fabrics markets are price  service  delivery time  quality and flexibility  with the relative importance of each factor depending upon the needs of particular customers and the specific product offering 
brookwood s management believes that brookwood maintains its ability to compete effectively by providing its customers with a broad array of high quality fabrics at competitive prices on a timely basis 
there are an increasing number of competitors entering the military market 
these competitors vary and include converters from other market segments  as well as major mills  some of which are brookwood suppliers  who are selectively targeting specific military specifications 
as these companies enter the military market  the competitive pressures may result in further price and demand volatility 
changes in the trade regulatory environment could weaken brookwood s competitive position and have a material adverse effect on its business  net sales and profitability 
imports of foreign made textile and apparel products are a significant source of competition for most sectors of the domestic textile industry 
the us government has attempted to regulate the growth of certain textile and apparel imports through tariffs and bilateral agreements  which establish quotas on imports from lesser developed countries that historically account for significant shares of us imports 
despite these efforts  imported apparel  which represents the area of heaviest import penetration  is estimated to represent in excess of of the us market 
the us textile industry has been and continues to be negatively impacted by existing worldwide trade practices  including the north american free trade agreement nafta  the central american free trade agreement cafta  anti dumping and duty enforcement activities by the us government and by the value of the us dollar in relation to other currencies 
the establishment of the world trade organization wto in has resulted in the phase out of quotas on textiles and apparel  effective january  under nafta and cafta there are no textile and apparel quotas between the us and the other parties for products that meet certain origin criteria 
tariffs among the countries are either already zero or are being phased out 
although these actions have the effect of exposing brookwood s market to the lower price structures of the other countries and  therefore  continuing to increase competitive pressures  management is not able to predict their specific impact 
accordingly  brookwood believes it must fully utilize other competitive strategies to replace sales lost to importers 
one strategy is to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has developed advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer application is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the us government is engaged in discussions with a number of countries or trading blocs with the intent of further liberalizing trade 
authority to negotiate new fast track agreements has been granted by congress  making new agreements in this field more likely 
any employee slowdown or strike or the failure to renew the collective bargaining agreement could disrupt brookwood s business 
although  in  kenyon entered into an agreement for a new three year collective bargaining agreement with local t of the new england joint board of unite here union  representing approximately employees at its rhode island plant facility  effective from march  through february   any employee slowdown or strike or failure to renew the collective bargaining agreement in could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
brookwood s success is dependent upon retaining key management personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed 
brookwood is dependent upon its executive officers for strategic business direction and specialized industry experience 
while the company believes that it could find replacements for these key personnel  the loss of their services could adversely affect brookwood s operations 
risks related to investments in financial instruments hallwood group invests in cash equivalents and marketable securities that carry investment risk and may incur loss 
as of december   cash is held in demand deposit accounts or is invested in a variety of highly liquid cash equivalents  principally money market funds 
at december   marketable securities included variable rate demand notes  which have long term nominal maturity dates with interest rates that generally reset weekly 
despite the long term nature of the variable rate demand 
table of contents notes  management believes that it has the ability to quickly liquidate these securities  which have an embedded put option that allows the bondholder to sell the security at par plus accrued interest 
neither the company or brookwood held any variable rate demand notes at december  while management believes the investments in demand deposits  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  carry limited risk  no guarantee is made that the investments will be recovered at their full value 
as previously discussed  the company opened an investment account with ubs ag in the first quarter 
the company intended to transfer a significant portion of the cash it holds from time to time to the ubs account to be invested in various instruments  including equity and debt that is publicly traded or is issued by united states and foreign publicly traded companies  financial institutions  mutual funds and exchange traded funds 
because of the current pending adversary proceeding  the company does not currently intend to transfer funds into the ubs account  but may reconsider this matter after the adversary proceeding is concluded 
risk factors related to the company s investment account at ubs are not provided as such activities have not commenced  nor is it determinable when such activities will occur 
risks related to our energy business risk factors for the company s energy business are not provided as the company s involvement in the energy business ceased in following the bankruptcy reorganization of its former energy affiliate  hallwood energy

on that date  hallwood energy demanded that the company fund the  which the company did not do 
following the commencement of litigation  hpi and fei intervened in the lawsuit and filed their respective complaints in intervention

in their second amended complaint  hpi and the trustee for the creditors trust contended that the additional damage was at least  based on the alleged failure of the company to fund the  which allegedly caused fei to not fund  due under the farmout agreement between hallwood energy and fei 
hpi and the trustee also asserted that the company was liable for exemplary damages of  on account of its failure to fund the last  under the equity support agreement

the district court may also revise the damage awards 
the company does not know when the united states district court will issue its decision or enter a final judgment 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized the audit committee  consisting solely of independent directors of the company  to investigate the facts giving rise to the proposed findings and various allegations that have been made arising out of hallwood energy s bankruptcy 
in addition  the company s board of directors authorized the audit committee to hire  at the company s expense  independent counsel and other advisors to assist the audit committee with such investigation 
the audit committee focused its investigation on whether there were any violations of the company s code of business conduct and ethics by management in connection with the matters addressed in the proposed findings  including  among other actions  the alleged nondisclosure by management to fei of the potential bankruptcy of hallwood energy and the company s purported intent not to fund the remaining  under the equity support agreement  various changes in testimony by management  the payment of the cash dividend to the company s stockholders in alleged violation of the equity support agreement and the delivery by hallwood energy to fei of a request for funding without any alleged disclosure of the potential bankruptcy of hallwood energy 
in march  the investigation was concluded and the audit committee reported its conclusions to the full board of directors 
the audit committee indicated in its presentation to the board of directors that  based on its investigation  it believes that  with respect to the matters investigated  management did not act unreasonably or in violation of the code of business conduct and ethics 
the audit committee also made various preliminary recommendations to the board of directors intended to assist the board of directors in monitoring and assessing risks to the company from the activities and investments of the company and its management 
after discussion with and input from management and discussions with members of the board concerning the nature of mr 
gumbiner s historic and existing investments  the audit committee determined that it was in the best interests of the company and its stockholders that i the company adopt a new policy requiring management to provide complete disclosure of any potential risks and any potential exposure in connection with the company s acquisition of ownership interests in other entities  including joint ventures  various communication improvements regarding the adversary proceeding and future litigation  ii at least annually or in connection with entering into any new outside business activities  the members of management of the company disclose to the audit committee all outside business activities  including the nomenclature used or to be used in connection therewith  in which they are engaged including sufficient information to enable the audit committee to assess any potential risks and any potential exposure to the company s business operations  reputation or financial condition that may result from those activities  and iii the audit committee review with management of the status and role of the company s outside advisors 
as a result of proposed findings in the adversary proceeding  the company believes that for accounting purposes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that an estimate of the amount of the loss for accounting purposes may be made 
accordingly  taking into consideration the company s objections to the proposed findings  the company reserved  at june  as no new information has become available regarding the outcome of the litigation  the company does not believe the reserve related to the adversary proceeding should be changed at december  this noncash  accrued reserve of  is reported in the company s balance sheet under hallwood energy matters litigation reserve  in addition to the  that was previously recorded in connection with the equity support agreement  for a total reserve of  at december  for the adversary proceeding 
this reserve amount has been established in consultation with the company s litigation counsel in the hallwood energy litigation  based on their best judgment of the probabilities of success related to  among other factors  the objections filed by the company and the adverse parties 
however  the actual results of litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty and the amount of the company s liability may exceed any estimates or reserves

environmental contingencies 
a number of jurisdictions in which the company or its subsidiaries operate have adopted laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
such laws and regulations may require the company to secure governmental permits and approvals and undertake measures to comply therewith 
compliance with the requirements imposed may be time consuming and costly 
while environmental considerations  by themselves  have not significantly affected the company s or its subsidiaries business to date  it is possible that such considerations may have a significant and adverse impact in the future

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general 
the company operates as a holding company 
the company operates its principal business in the textile products industry through its wholly owned brookwood subsidiary 
for financial reporting purposes  the company fully consolidates all of its subsidiaries and accounted for its former investment in hallwood energy using the equity method of accounting 
textile products 
in the three years ended december   the company derived all of its operating revenues from the textile activities of its brookwood subsidiary  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its ability to continue sales to existing customers  costs  availability of supplies  its response to competition and its ability to generate new markets and products 
although the textile activities of the company and its subsidiaries collectively  the hallwood group have generated positive cash flow in recent years  there is no assurance that this trend will continue 
while brookwood has enjoyed substantial revenues from in its military business  there is no assurance that such revenues will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend management believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the activity of the us military 
if this activity changes  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
military sales of   and  for  and  respectively  were lower in and lower in from the respective previous years 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in significant military sales 
changes in specifications  procurement entity budgets  or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications  budgetary and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market is highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
management acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
unstable global nylon and chemical pricing and volatile domestic energy costs  coupled with a varying product mix  have continued to cause fluctuations in brookwood s margins  a trend that will potentially continue 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has developed advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing success of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry 
there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the textile products business is not interdependent with the company s other business operations 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank facility and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 
conversely  brookwood does not guarantee debts of the company or any of the company s other subsidiaries and is not obligated to contribute additional capital to the company beyond dividend payments and the tax sharing agreement 
in march  kenyon was affected by the general flooding that took place in the state of rhode island and in particular from the pawcatuck river 
kenyon was closed for a period of seven days after which it reinstituted production of unaffected production lines 
only certain production lines were affected and production capacity was restored within a few weeks 
brookwood filed claims with its insurance carriers  through its kenyon subsidiary 
brookwood recognized the  insurance policy deductible in the second quarter and has received from its carriers  for its building and contents claims  including  received in brookwood also filed a claim under its business interruption insurance policy and received  in july from its carrier in satisfaction of its claims  which was recognized as a recovery in the second quarter 
no additional amounts are due 

table of contents in may  brookwood laminating completed the purchase of its connecticut production facility pursuant to the exercise of an option contained in its lease agreement 
the purchase price of  was funded with operating cash flows 
investments in financial instruments 
in the first quarter  the company opened an investment account with ubs ag  a global financial services firm  and disclosed that it intended to transfer a significant portion of the cash it holds from time to time to the ubs account to be placed in various financial instruments and may borrow additional amounts from ubs to invest on a leveraged basis 
as of march   no funds have been transferred into the ubs account 
because of the current pending adversary proceeding  the company does not currently intend to transfer funds into the ubs account  but may reconsider this matter after the adversary proceeding is concluded 
energy 
hallwood energy was a privately held independent oil and gas limited partnership and operated as an upstream energy company engaged in the acquisition  development  exploration  production  and sale of hydrocarbons  with a primary focus on natural gas assets 
in march  hallwood energy  hem the general partner of hallwood energy and hallwood energy s subsidiaries  filed petitions for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
the cases were adjudicated in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of texas  dallas division  in in re hallwood energy  lp  etal case no 
the company was only an investor in and creditor of hallwood energy 
the bankruptcy filing did not include the company or brookwood 
in october  the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization of the debtors 
refer to the section investments in hallwood energy for a further discussion of the company s former energy activities  including the bankruptcy case 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
brookwood may receive instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory for delivery at a later date 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and identifies the inventory as separate from brookwood s inventory 
generally  a customer provides such instructions to accommodate its lack of available storage space for inventory 
this practice is customary in the textile industry and with respect to certain brookwood customers 
in these cases  the brookwood customer either dictates delivery dates at the time the order is placed or when the customer has not specified a fixed delivery date  the customer owns the goods and has asked brookwood to keep them in the warehouse 
for all of its bill and hold sales  brookwood has no future obligations  the customer is billed when the product is ready for shipment and expected to pay under standard billing and credit terms  regardless of the actual delivery date  and the inventory is identified and not available for brookwood s use 
the gross margins on the bill and hold sales held by brookwood at the end of each of the three years ended december  were not material 
deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
management is required to estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance to reduce part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considers various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected future income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded  if any 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of long lived asset and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for long lived asset held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the long lived asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the long lived asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenues performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the long lived asset  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes and the level of expected operating expenses 
impairment of investments accounted for under equity method 
investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment is believed to have fallen below the company s carrying value 
when such a decline is deemed other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to the statement of operations for the difference between the investment s carrying value and its estimated fair value at the time 
in making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary  the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline  the investee s financial performance  and the company s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment s market value 
however  a decline in the quoted market price below the carrying amount or the existence of operating losses is not necessarily indicative of a loss in value that is other than temporary 
all are factors to be evaluated 
differing assumptions could affect whether an investment is impaired 
at least annually  the company performs impairment reviews and determines if a writedown is required 
as application of the equity method of accounting resulted in the carrying value of the company s investment in hallwood energy to be reduced to zero in the year ended december   an impairment review was not required for the investments in hallwood energy 
the company s ownership interests in hallwood energy were extinguished in october when the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization of the debtors 
in prior years  the company s evaluation of its investment in hallwood energy contained assumptions including i an evaluation of reserves using assumptions commonly used in the industry  some of which were not the same as are required by the sec to be used for financial reporting purposes  ii realization of fair value for various reserve categories based upon hallwood energy s historical experience  and iii value per acre in a potential sale transaction  based upon acreage owned in productive areas with shale characteristics similar to acreage previously sold and other sale activity of acreage with shale formations 
at december   the company does not hold any investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to past and future demand and worldwide and local market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
inventory levels  usage and age are evaluated and inventories are adjusted to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
contingencies 
from time to time  the company  its subsidiaries  certain of its affiliates and others have been named as defendants in lawsuits relating to various transactions in which it or its affiliated entities participated 
the company accrues for losses associated with contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
management s estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal proceeding  the merit of the defenses and consultation with legal counsel 
in certain matters  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution 
as additional information becomes available  management reassesses the potential liability  if any  related to pending claims and may revise its estimates 

table of contents due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal process  estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes  with the result that hallwood group s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
the critical accounting policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of hallwood group s accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
presentation the discussion of hallwood group s financial condition and results of operations that follows is intended to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect its financial statements 
results of operations hallwood group reported a net loss of  for the year ended december   compared to net income of  for and  for revenue was  for   for and  for operating income loss  was   and  in  and  respectively 
results included a litigation reserve of  in connection with the hallwood energy litigation matters 
revenues textile products sales of  in decreased by  or  compared to  in  which was a decrease of  or  compared to  in the decreases were principally due to a decrease of  in and a decrease of  in  over prior year amounts  in sales of specialty fabric to us military contractors as a result of reductions in orders from the military to brookwood s customers 
sales of products in the other market segments increased in and  compared to prior year amounts 
brookwood has two customers who accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in one or more of the three years ended december  sales to one brookwood customer  tennier industries  inc tennier  accounted for more than of brookwood s sales in each of the three years ended december  brookwood s relationship with tennier is ongoing

expenses textile products cost of sales of  decreased by  or  in compared to  in  which was a decrease of  or  compared to  in the and decreases principally resulted from material and labor costs associated with the lower sales volume  offset by changes in product mix and by an increase in royalty expense related to certain military products 
cost of sales includes all costs associated with the manufacturing process  including but not limited to  materials  labor  utilities  royalties  depreciation on manufacturing equipment and all costs associated with the purchase  receipt and transportation of goods and materials to brookwood s facilities  including inbound freight  purchasing and receiving costs  inspection costs  internal transfer costs and other costs of the distribution network 
brookwood believes that the reporting and composition of cost of sales and gross margin is comparable with similar companies in the textile converting and finishing industry 
the gross profit margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the lower gross profit margin for and was attributed to the lower sales volume  changes in product mix and higher royalty costs  partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies such as reductions in material working loss 

table of contents administrative and selling expenses were comprised of the following in thousands years ended december  brookwood company total brookwood s administrative and selling expenses of  for increased by  or  from the amount of  which decreased by  or  from the amount of  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in professional services of  principally legal fees  partially offset by a decrease of  related to performance and other related payroll costs  reduced factor commissions of  and kenyon flood cost  net of insurance recoveries  of  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in performance compensation of  and professional fees  principally legal fees  of  which were partially offset by an increase in salary and benefits of  the textile products administrative and selling expenses include items such as payroll  professional fees  sales commissions  marketing  rent  insurance and travel

research and development expenses were approximately  in   in and  in the company s administrative expenses were  for  compared to  for  and  for the decrease of  or  was primarily attributable to lower professional fees of  principally related to the hallwood energy litigation matters 
the decline in professional fees is principally attributable to the december conclusion of the trial in the adversary proceeding and the reimbursement of previously expensed legal fees from the insurance carrier for the company s directors and officers liability insurance policy for costs related to the hallwood energy litigation matters 
the increase of  or  was primarily attributable to higher professional fees of  principally related to the hallwood energy bankruptcy and the associated litigation matters 
in  a litigation a charge of  was recorded by the company for the hallwood energy litigation matters  as described below 
in connection with the hallwood energy litigation matters discussed in item legal proceedings  on july   the bankruptcy court issued proposed findings in the adversary proceeding 
the court proposed that the united states district court award damages against the company totaling approximately  plus prejudgment and post judgment interest and attorneys fees as may be requested and awarded pursuant to a subsequent motion 
the proposed findings including the proposed monetary awards are not final 
the united states district court is reviewing the objections that have been filed by all parties in the case on a de novo basis and will eventually accept the proposed findings  decline to adopt the proposed findings and issue its own findings  or accept some of the proposed findings while declining to adopt the remaining proposed findings and issuing its own findings in their place 
the district court may also revise the damage awards 
the company does not know when the united states district court will issue its decision or enter a final judgment 
as a result of the proposed findings in the adversary proceeding  the company believes that for accounting purposes it is probable that a liability has been incurred and that an estimate of the amount of the loss for accounting purposes may be made 
accordingly  taking into consideration the company s objections to the proposed findings  the company reserved  at june  as no new information has become available regarding the outcome of the litigation  the company does not believe the reserve related to the adversary proceeding should be changed at december  this noncash  accrued reserve of  is reported in the company s balance sheet under hallwood energy matters litigation reserve  in addition to the  that was previously recorded in connection with the equity support agreement  for a total reserve of  at december  for the adversary proceeding 
this reserve amount has been established in consultation with the company s litigation counsel in the hallwood energy litigation  based on their best judgment of the probabilities of success related to  among other factors  the objections filed by the company and the adverse parties 
however  the actual results of litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty and the amount of liability to the company may exceed any estimates or reserves 

table of contents effective february   the company and certain other parties entered into the settlement agreement to settle the hallwood energy litigation claims other than the adversary proceeding 
the terms of the settlement agreement include the payment by the company of  in addition to payments by other defendants and the company s insurance carrier for its directors and officers liability policy
