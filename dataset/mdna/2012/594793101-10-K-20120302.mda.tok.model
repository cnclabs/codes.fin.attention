the company maintained its quarterly per share dividend and repurchased million shares under its stock repurchase plan 
revenues increased to million in the second quarter of  compared to million in the first quarter of second quarter operating expenses were down by sequentially 
second quarter net income of million was more than double the net income of million reported for the first quarter of the company also continued its stock repurchase program 
in addition  the company also maintained its quarterly per share dividend payment 
revenues for the third quarter of totaled million  as compared to million in the second quarter of and million in the third quarter of sequential revenue growth was driven by increasing demand across most major markets served by the company 
bookings for the third quarter of resulted in a book to bill ratio that was greater than one 
gross margin in the third quarter of increased to  as compared to in the second quarter of  in part due to increased revenue levels to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
third quarter net income increased to million  or per diluted share  as compared to million  or per diluted share  in the second quarter of as a result of the company s ongoing expense management and the company s stock repurchase program  third quarter earnings per diluted share were equal to  which was equal to the third quarter earnings per diluted share  despite significantly lower revenues in the third quarter of as compared to the third quarter of the company also maintained its quarterly per share dividend 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenues in the fourth quarter of increased to million  as compared to million in the third quarter of the sequential growth was driven by increasing demand across most major markets for the company s products 
during the fourth quarter of  the book to bill ratio was significantly greater than one 
fourth quarter gross margin increased to  from in the third quarter of the improvement in gross margin was in part due to better capacity utilization as a result of increased revenue levels to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
during the quarter  total operating expenses included a million non cash  pre tax charge related to the impairment of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment located at the company s san jose fabrication facility 
operating income in the fourth quarter of was million  or of sales  as compared to million  or of sales  in the third quarter net income in the fourth quarter of was million  or per basic and diluted share  which included a per diluted share reduction due to equipment impairment

during the third quarter of  revenues increased to million  representing an increase of million  or  from million in the second quarter of  marking the sixth consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the company 
the increase in revenues as compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to improved demand in the industrial and communications end markets 
compared to the same period last year  revenues increased by million  or  due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company s geographies and end markets 
bookings for the third quarter of declined from second quarter levels  primarily due to reduced orders from distributors as they adjusted inventories to be in line with reduced order lead times 
the company s book to bill ratio for the third quarter of was less than one 
third quarter gross margin was  as compared to in the prior quarter 
during the quarter  gross margin improvement resulting from increased factory capacity utilization was offset by an increase in reserves for excess inventory

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the fourth quarter of  revenues decreased to million from million in the third quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  revenues increased by million  or  due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company s geographies and end markets 
customer demand moderated in the fourth quarter of as the semiconductor industry completed its recovery from the downturn of fourth quarter bookings seasonally declined from the third quarter levels  resulting in a book to bill ratio below one for the quarter 
the company s book to bill remained above one for the full year consistent with bookings being unusually high due to long lead times in the first half of the year followed by softer demand and shorter more normal lead times in the second half 
fourth quarter gross margin was  as compared to in the third quarter of this decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of reduced factory utilization combined with a greater mix of direct sales to customers serving consumer markets  which tend to carry lower gross margins 
net income for the fourth quarter of was million  or per basic and diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the third quarter of  and net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the fourth quarter of net income for the fourth quarter of  which included a million non cash  pre tax charge related to the impairment of certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
during the fourth quarter of  cash flows from operations were million 
the company repurchased million of its common stock during the fourth quarter of and also maintained its quarterly per share dividend 
for the year ended december   revenues increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company s geographies and end markets  which resulted from improved macro economic conditions  an expanded sales force  solid operational execution and increased shipments of new products 
gross margin for increased to  from for this increase was primarily due to improved factory utilization and  to a lesser extent  a reduced sales mix of lower margin products shipped to the wireless handset market as compared to operating margin for was which represents the highest level in a decade 
net income increased over in to million  or per diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in the diluted earnings per share of was an all time annual record for micrel and surpassed its previous record of  which was achieved in when total revenues were higher than revenues in the increase in diluted earnings per share was due in part to a decrease in the number of diluted shares in  as compared to  as a result of the company s share repurchase program

in addition  in the company repurchased million of its common stock  and paid million in dividends to shareholders 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the first quarter of  revenues decreased to million from million in the fourth quarter of this larger than normal seasonal decline in revenue from the fourth quarter of was mainly due to a larger than expected reduction in sales to a korean wireless handset and consumer electronic device manufacturer which moderated product deliveries during the quarter to control its inventory levels 
the company also experienced a reduction in overall demand towards the end of the first quarter of related to disruptions in the worldwide electronics supply chain as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in japan 
in addition  the first quarter revenues were impacted by reduced shipments to certain asian based stocking representative channel partners that reduced their inventory levels during the quarter 
as compared to the same period last year  first quarter revenues increased by million 
first quarter book to bill ratio was below one  but showed improvement compared to the fourth quarter of first quarter gross margin was  as compared to in the fourth quarter of despite the lower revenues  first quarter gross margin increased from the previous quarter primarily due to a larger proportion of higher margin products

in addition to maintaining its quarterly per share cash dividend  during the first quarter of the company repurchased million of its common stock 
during the second quarter of  revenues increased to million from million in the first quarter of this increase resulted primarily from increased demand in the high speed communications end market as well as a resumption of more normal shipment levels to a korean wireless handset and consumer electronic device manufacturer which had moderated product deliveries during the previous quarter 
the sequential increase in revenues was less than expected primarily due to lower than expected demand in the industrial end market 
the second quarter book to bill ratio was above one for the first time since the second quarter of second quarter gross margin increased to as compared to in the first quarter of primarily due to a larger proportion of higher margin products combined with decreased excess inventory charges 
net income for the second quarter of was million  or per basic and diluted share  as compared to net income of million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for the first quarter of  and net income of million  or per basic and diluted share  for the second quarter of during the second quarter of  cash flows from operations were million

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for   and  the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets that it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development and customer acceptance of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in part i item a of this report 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  including global economic conditions  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based accounting  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
the company generates revenue by selling products to oems  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company allows certain distributors located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue and related cost of sales are not recognized  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 
sales to oem customers and stocking representatives are recognized based upon the shipment terms of the sale transaction when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once an inventory write down provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
share based compensation 
share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
to determine fair value  the company uses the black scholes valuation model which requires input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
in addition  the company estimates expected forfeiture rates of stock grants and share based compensation expense is only recognized for those shares expected to vest 
determining the input factors  such as expected term  expected volatility and estimated forfeiture rates  requires significant judgment based on subjective future expectations 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  and state research and development credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believed that future taxable income levels would be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and had not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
the company uses a two step approach to recognize and measure uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
during recent years  the company has resolved litigation involving intellectual property claims 
an estimated liability is accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the liability accrual is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of total net revenues for the periods indicated

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued net revenues 
net revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for these decreases were due to lower customer demand across the company s geographies and end markets  which resulted primarily from global macro economic conditions 
other products revenues  which consist of custom and foundry product revenues  increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in foundry services 
for the year ended december   net revenues increased to million compared to million in standard product revenues  which represented of net revenues  increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for other products revenues  which consist primarily of custom and foundry product revenues  increased to million of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million for these increases were due to greater overall demand from customers in all of the company s geographies and end markets  which resulted from improved macro economic conditions  an expanded sales force  solid operational execution and increased shipments of new products 
customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
historically  the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders for products to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry  orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenues  it can be very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
the resulting lack of visibility into demand also makes it difficult to match product build with future demand as the company s lead times to build its products may be substantially longer than order lead times 
as noted in item a risk factors and above in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  a trend has developed over the last several years whereby customers in the semiconductor supply chain have worked to minimize the amount of inventory of semiconductors they hold 
as a consequence  customers are generally providing less order backlog to the company and other semiconductor suppliers  and relying on short lead times to buffer their build schedules 
shorter lead times reduce visibility into end demand and increase the reliance on turns fill orders 
the reluctance of customers to provide order backlog together with short lead times and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 
international sales represented  and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales to customers in asia represented of net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  and of the company s net revenues for the year ended december  the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has resulted in increased pricing pressure for the company and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves in any manner other than by lowering prices 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit 
gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for this decrease was primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin consumer oriented products and lower factory utilization 
for the year ended december   the company s gross margin increased to from for this increase in gross margin resulted primarily from improved factory utilization and  to a lesser extent  a reduced sales mix of lower margin products shipped to the wireless handset market as compared to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented for the year ended december  compared to for on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased million or to million for the year ended compared to million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in employee compensation costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses were relatively flat at million compared to million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses represented for the year ended december  as compared to for on an absolute dollar basis  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for this decrease was primarily due to decreased staffing levels  decreased sales commissions and decreased bonus compensation accruals 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million from million for this increase was primarily due to increase in sales headcount  increased commission expenses  and increased profit sharing accruals 
proxy contest credits 
during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in a proxy contest with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this issue resulted in micrel incurring incremental expenses of million during these expenses consisted primarily of outside consulting and legal fees 
subsequent to a special meeting of shareholders on may   at which the company s shareholders rejected all proposals set forth by ocm  ocm agreed to withdraw its slate of nominees for the board of directors  and support micrel s board nominees at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders 
micrel s slate of directors was subsequently elected by shareholders at the company s annual meeting on october  during the fourth quarter of  the company negotiated a reduction in outside service fees related to the proxy contest and recorded a  credit 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued equipment impairment and restructuring charges 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million charge for the impairment of certain excess semiconductor manufacturing equipment that was removed from service and held for sale as of december  the million net book value of the equipment held for sale was reduced to its estimated sales value of  due to increased manufacturing output requirements that resulted from increased product demand in  this equipment was placed back in service at  as of december  share based compensation 
share based compensation costs for stock option grants are based on the fair value calculated from a stock option pricing model on the date of grant 
the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of share based compensation awards 
during  the company recorded million in pre tax share based compensation expense  of which million is included in cost of revenues  million is included in research and development expense and million is included in sales  general and administrative expense
