the sapient approach our unique consultative methodology  sapient approach  helps ensure predictable business results that are delivered on time and on budget while meaningfully meeting the needs of our clients end customers 
we employ a collaborative  agile lean based delivery approach  in which we develop and release in an iterative manner usable components of a deliverable  thus enabling our clients to review  validate and commence use of work product throughout the life cycle of a project  rather than await the end of the project to realize its full benefits 
our overall approach has been time tested over a number of years and has successfully produced meaningful results for our clients 
for our sapientnitro business unit  we slightly modify sapient approach with the idea engineering approach  which uniquely leverages our multi disciplinary teams and blends our skills at idea creation and strategy with the technology needed to bring them to life for today s digitally powered consumer 
while sapient approach provides clients significant value and return on investment in the shortest possible time period  it also minimizes assignment risk because discrete pieces of work are tested and accepted throughout the assignment  while at the same time it gives our clients speed to market advantages which are increasingly important given the rate and speed of change in the market today 
in contrast to traditional consulting services methods that require heavy up front investment in time and effort to define all possible requirements  our agile lean based methodology uses actual development to evaluate and improve the design as the assignment progresses 
this means that unnecessary steps or features are identified and eliminated early in the design and implementation process  materially reducing overall assignment cost 
sapient approach also enables us to commit to delivering our marketing services and other work within the price and schedule that we have promised to our clients  and to create solutions that bring together marketing  business  user  creative and technology requirements to solve our clients problems 
we design these solutions to deliver tangible business value to clients  including increased revenues  reduced costs and more effective use of assets 
additionally  the idea engineering approach integrates a creative methodology to design and create user experiences that are useful  usable and compelling 
our creative approach is highly iterative  and integrates input from a wide range of perspectives and disciplines 
this approach is highly scalable  and evolves based upon whether the creative output is intended to be a marketing campaign  a social media initiative  a website customer experience  a mobile application  or a retail experience 
through our creative approach we develop a deep understanding of the target user s needs  and synchronize the design of the user experience with agile delivery of the supporting technology to minimize risk and rework 
sapient approach also enables flexibility in selecting the process standardization and continuous improvement models that work best for each client 
our teams regularly incorporate six sigma  capability maturity model integration cmmi  international standards organization iso and information technology infrastructure library itil processes to ensure that appropriate rigor  discipline and accountability are built into each project 
by employing these industry leading techniques  our teams establish an enduring environment of process improvement that enables organizational capabilities essential to sustaining competitive business advantage

we believe that the industry and geographic focus of our sales professionals enhances their knowledge and expertise within their applicable segments and generates additional client engagements 
competition the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
in our sapientnitro and sapient global markets business units  we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  traditional and digital advertising and marketing agencies  offshore consulting and outsourcing companies  and clients internal it departments 
to a lesser extent  we compete with boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geographically focused 
with respect to sapient government services  we both compete and partner with large systems integrators  major consulting firms with dedicated government business units  and government contractors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include ability to solve business problems  ability to provide creative concepts and solutions  expertise and talent with advanced technologies  global scale  expertise in delivering complex assignments through teams located in globally distributed geographies  availability of resources  quality and speed of delivery  price of solutions  industry knowledge  technology enabled marketing expertise  understanding of user experience  and sophisticated assignment and program management capability 
we also believe that we compete favorably when considering these factors and that our ability to deliver business innovation and outstanding value to our clients on time and on budget  our gdd model  our integrated marketing services capabilities and our successful track record in working with our clients distinguish us from our competitors

risk factors you should carefully consider the following important factors which could cause our actual business  financial condition or future results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k or presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by economic conditions and related fluctuations in client demand for marketing  business  technology and other consulting services 
the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions historically has tended to fluctuate with economic cycles particularly those cycles in the united states and europe  where we earn the majority of our revenues 
during economic cycles in which many companies are experiencing financial difficulties or uncertainty  clients and potential clients may cancel or delay spending on marketing  technology and other business initiatives 
our efforts to down size  when necessary  in a manner intended to mirror downturned economic conditions could be delayed and costly and could also result in us having inadequate people resources as economic conditions improve 
a downturn could result in reduced demand for our services  assignment cancellations or delays  lower revenues and operating margins resulting from price reduction pressures for our services  and payment and collection issues with our clients 
any of these events could materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our markets are highly competitive and we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
the markets for the services we provide are highly competitive 
we believe that we compete principally with large systems consulting and implementation firms  traditional and digital advertising and marketing agencies  offshore consulting and outsourcing companies  and clients internal information systems departments 
to a lesser extent  other competitors include boutique consulting firms that maintain specialized skills and or are geographically focused 
regarding our government services practice  we both compete and partner with large systems integrators  major consulting firms with dedicated government business units  and government contractors 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  and generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition  than we do 
often  these competitors offer a larger and more diversified suite of products and services than we offer 
if we cannot keep pace with the intense competition in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
our international operations and global distributed delivery gdd model subject us to increased risk 
we have offices throughout the world 
our international operations account for a significant percentage of our total revenues  and our gdd model is a key component of our ability to deliver our services successfully 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  including economic recessions in foreign countries  fluctuations in currency exchange rates or impositions of restrictive currency controls  political instability  war or military conflict  changes in regulatory requirements  complexities and costs in effectively managing multi national operations and associated internal controls and procedures  significant changes in immigration policies or difficulties in obtaining required immigration approvals for international assignments  restrictions imposed on the import and export of technologies in countries where we operate  reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries  and changes in tax laws 
in particular  our gdd model depends heavily on our offices in gurgaon  bangalore and noida  india 
any escalation in the political or military instability in india or pakistan or the surrounding countries  or a business interruption resulting from a natural disaster  such as an earthquake  could hinder our ability to use gdd successfully and could result in material adverse effects to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  the delivery of our services from remote locations causes us to rely on data  phone  power and other networks which are not as reliable in india as those in other countries where we operate 
any failures of these systems  or any failure of our systems generally  could affect the success of our gdd model 
remote delivery of our services also increases the complexity and risk of delivering our services  which could affect our ability to satisfy our clients expectations or perform our services within the estimated time frame and budget for each assignment 
changes to government structure or policies in countries in which we operate could negatively impact our operations if such changes were to limit or cease any benefits that may currently be available to us 
for example  although the indian government has historically offered generous tax incentives to induce foreign companies to base operations in india  new taxes have been introduced in recent years that partially offset those benefits 
on march   the income tax incentive of one of our software technology parks stps units in india expired 
on march   the income tax incentives applicable to our other two stps units in india expired 
in we established a new india unit in a special economic zone sez  which is eligible for a five year  tax holiday 
immediately following the expiration of the tax holiday  the sez unit is entitled to a five year  tax holiday 
in  we established three new india business units in 
table of contents sezs  which are eligible for similar tax benefits 
the expiration of incentives may adversely affect our cost of operations and increase the risk of delivering our services on budget for client assignments 
expiration of benefits provided to us by having operations based in india could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  it has become increasingly difficult to obtain necessary visas for certain international personnel  particularly technical personnel  working in our domestic offices  and to receive necessary immigration approvals for our domestic employees working abroad on international assignments 
if these challenges continue or increase  it may limit our ability to engage the most desirable personnel for particular assignments  increase the time necessary to receive approvals to do so or prevent us from obtaining such approvals  and increase our costs  all of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially impacted by military actions  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest 
military actions in iraq  afghanistan and elsewhere  global terrorism  natural disasters and political unrest in the middle east and other countries are among the factors that may adversely impact regional and global economic conditions and  concomitantly  client investments in our services 
in addition to the potential impact of any of these events on the business of our clients  these events could pose a threat to our global operations and people 
specifically  our people and operations in india could be impacted if the recent rise in civil unrest  terrorism and conflicts with bordering countries in india were to increase significantly 
as a result  significant disruptions caused by such events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not attract and retain qualified professional staff  we may be unable to perform adequately our client engagements and could be limited in accepting new client engagements 
our business is labor intensive  and our success depends upon our ability to attract  retain  train and motivate highly skilled employees 
the improvement in demand for marketing and business and technology consulting services has further increased the need for employees with specialized skills or significant experience in marketing  business and technology consulting  particularly at senior levels 
we have been expanding our operations  and these expansion efforts will be highly dependent on attracting a sufficient number of highly skilled people 
we may not be successful in attracting enough employees to achieve our expansion or staffing plans 
furthermore  the industry turnover rates for these types of employees are high  and we may not be successful in retaining  training and motivating the employees we attract 
any inability to attract  retain  train and motivate employees could impair our ability to manage adequately and complete existing assignments and to bid for or accept new client engagements 
such inability may also force us to increase our hiring of expensive independent contractors  which may increase our costs and reduce our profitability on client engagements 
we must also devote substantial managerial and financial resources to monitoring and managing our workforce and other resources 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage the levels and related costs of our workforce and other resources effectively 
we earn revenues  incur costs and maintain cash balances in multiple currencies  and currency fluctuations affect our financial results 
we have significant international operations  and we frequently earn our revenues and incur our costs in various foreign currencies 
our international service revenues were million for doing business in these foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency risks in numerous areas  including revenues and receivables  purchases  payroll and investments on both a transactional level and a financial statement translation basis 
as of december   of our assets and of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
we also have a significant amount of foreign currency operating income and net asset exposures 
certain foreign currency exposures  to some extent  are naturally offset within a foreign country  because revenues and costs are denominated in the same foreign currency  and certain cash balances are held in 
table of contents us dollar denominated accounts 
however  due to the increasing size and importance of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could materially impact our financial results 
our gdd model also subjects us to increased currency risk because we incur a portion of our assignment costs in indian rupees and earn revenue from our clients in other currencies 
we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies 
there is no guarantee that any hedging activity we may undertake will be effective or that our financial condition will not be negatively impacted by the currency exchange rate fluctuations of the indian rupee or other currencies versus the us dollar 
costs for our delivery of services  including labor  could increase as a result of the decrease in value of the us dollar against the indian rupee or other currencies  affecting our reported results 
our cash positions include amounts denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds from our subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which these funds can be accessed 
the repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries outside the united states could have adverse tax consequences and be limited by foreign currency exchange controls 
any fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  or changes in local tax laws  could materially impact the availability and size of these funds for repatriation or transfer 
we have significant fixed operating costs  which may be difficult to adjust in response to unanticipated fluctuations in revenues 
a high percentage of our operating expenses  particularly salary expense  rent  depreciation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets  are fixed in advance of any particular quarter 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number or average size of  or an unanticipated delay in the scheduling for  our assignments may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
an unanticipated termination or decrease in size or scope of a major assignment  a client s decision not to proceed with a assignment we anticipated or the completion during a quarter of several major client assignments could require us to maintain underutilized employees and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues and earnings may also fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of such factors as the contractual terms and timing of completion of assignments  including achievement of certain business results  any delays incurred in connection with assignments  the adequacy of provisions for losses and bad debts  the accuracy of our estimates of resources required to complete ongoing assignments  loss of key highly skilled personnel necessary to complete assignments  and general economic conditions 
changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors  some of which are outside our control  including changes in relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those tax laws  changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets which are based on estimates of our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies and the economic environment in which we do business  
table of contents the outcome of future tax audits and examinations  and changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  many transactions occur where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals 
our profits may decrease and or we may incur significant unanticipated costs if we do not accurately estimate the costs of fixed price engagements 
a portion of our service revenues in was derived from fixed price contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to estimate accurately the resources and schedule required for an assignment  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the assignment plan upon which our fixed price contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are consistently entering into contracts for large assignments that magnify this risk 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete assignments in the past  which has occasionally resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some assignments at an early stage of the assignment engagement  which could result in a fixed price that is too low 
therefore  any changes from our original estimates could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability will be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our pricing and utilization rates as well as control our costs 
our profitability derives from and is impacted by three primary factors i the prices for our services  ii our professionals utilization or billable time  and iii our costs 
to achieve our desired level of profitability  our utilization must remain at an appropriate rate  and we must contain our costs 
should we reduce our prices in the future as a result of pricing pressures  or should we be unable to achieve our target utilization rates and costs  our profitability could be adversely impacted 
we partner with third parties on certain complex engagements in which our performance depends upon  and may be adversely impacted by  the performance of such third parties 
certain complex assignments may require that we partner with specialized software or systems vendors or other partners to perform our services 
often in these circumstances  we are liable to our clients for the performance of these third parties 
should the third parties fail to perform timely or satisfactorily  our clients may elect to terminate the assignments or withhold payment until the services have been completed successfully 
additionally  the timing of our revenue recognition may be affected or we may realize lower profits if we incur additional costs due to delays or because we must assign additional personnel to complete the assignment 
furthermore  our relationships with our clients and our reputation generally may suffer harm as a result of our partners unsatisfactory performance 
our clients could unexpectedly terminate their contracts for our services 
most of our contracts can be canceled by the client with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
a client s termination of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff that were allocated to that client s assignment 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large assignments  or client termination of one or more recurring revenue contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may be liable to our clients for substantial damages caused by our unauthorized disclosures of confidential information  breaches of data security  failure to remedy system failures or other material contract breaches 
we frequently receive confidential information from our clients  including confidential client data that we use to develop solutions 
if any person  including one of our employees  misappropriates client confidential information  or if client confidential information is inappropriately disclosed due to a breach of our computer systems  including an attack by computer programmers or hackers who may develop or deploy viruses  worms  or other malicious software programs  system failures or otherwise  we may have substantial liabilities to our clients or their customers 
further  any such compromise to our computer systems could disrupt our operations  as well as our clients operations 
further  many of our assignments involve technology applications or systems that are critical to the operations of our clients businesses and handle very large volumes of transactions 
if we fail to perform our services correctly  we may be unable to deliver applications or systems to our clients with the promised functionality or within the promised time frame  or to satisfy the required service levels for support and maintenance 
any such failures by us could result in claims by our clients for substantial damages against us 
we may be liable for breaches of confidentiality or data security  defects in the applications or systems we deliver or other material contract breaches that we may commit during the performance of our services collectively  contract breaches 
in certain circumstances we agree to unlimited liability for contract breaches 
additionally  we cannot be assured that any insurance coverages will be applicable and enforceable in all cases  or sufficient to cover substantial liabilities that we may incur 
further  we cannot be assured that contractual limitations on liability will be applicable and enforceable in all cases 
accordingly  even if our insurance coverages or contractual limitations on liability are found to be applicable and enforceable  our liability to our clients for contract breaches could be material in amount and affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  such claims may harm our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties  and create liability for us as well as harm our reputation and client relationships 
the services that we offer to clients may infringe the intellectual property ip rights of third parties and result in legal claims against our clients and sapient 
these claims may damage our reputation  adversely impact our client relationships and create liability for us 
moreover  we generally agree in our client contracts to indemnify the clients for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party ip infringement claims associated with our services  and the resolution of these claims  irrespective of whether a court determines that our services infringed another party s ip rights  may be time consuming  disruptive to our business and extraordinarily costly 
finally  in connection with an ip infringement dispute  we may be required to cease using or developing certain ip that we offer to our clients 
these circumstances could adversely impact our ability to generate revenue as well as require us to incur significant expense to develop alternative or modified services for our clients 
we may be unable to protect our proprietary methodology 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary methodology and other ip rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements  and copyright and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors and clients  and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our ip rights 

table of contents our stock price is volatile and may result in substantial losses for investors 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations at various times in the past 
our trading price could continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and achievement of key business metrics by us or our competitors  changes in operating results estimates by securities analysts  any differences between our reported results and securities analysts published or unpublished expectations  announcements of new contracts or service offerings made by us or our competitors  announcements of acquisitions or joint ventures made by us or our competitors  and general economic or stock market conditions 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
the commencement of this type of litigation against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
certain of our directors have significant voting power and may effectively control the outcome of any stockholder vote 
jerry a 
greenberg  our former co chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of the company and current member of our board of directors  and j 
stuart moore  our former co chairman of the board of directors and co chief executive officer and current member of our board of directors  own  in the aggregate  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of february  as a result  they have the ability to substantially influence and  in some cases  may effectively control the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sapient  even if such a change in control would benefit other investors 
we are dependent on our key employees 
our success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of key employees 
our employment arrangements with key personnel provide that employment is terminable at will by either party 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if our key employees resign from sapient to join a competitor or to form a competing company  the loss of such personnel and any resulting loss of existing or potential clients or employees to any such competitor could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot be certain that any agreements we require our employees to enter into will be effective in preventing them from engaging in these actions or that courts or other adjudicative entities will substantially enforce these agreements 
we may be unable to achieve anticipated benefits from acquisitions 
the anticipated benefits from any acquisitions that we may undertake might not be achieved 
for example  if we acquire a company  we cannot be certain that clients of the acquired business will continue to conduct business with us  or that employees of the acquired business will continue their employment or integrate successfully into our operations and culture 
the identification  consummation and integration of acquisitions require substantial attention from management 
the diversion of management s attention  as well as any difficulties encountered in the integration process  could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  we may incur significant expenses in completing any such acquisitions  and we may assume significant liabilities  some of which may be unknown at the time of such acquisition 

table of contents the failure to successfully and timely implement certain financial system changes to improve operating efficiency and enhance our reporting controls could harm our business 
we have implemented and continue to install several upgrades and enhancements to our financial systems 
we expect these initiatives to enable us to achieve greater operating and financial reporting efficiency and also enhance our existing control environment through increased levels of automation of certain processes 
failure to successfully execute these initiatives in a timely  effective and efficient manner could result in the disruption of our operations  the inability to comply with our sarbanes oxley obligations and the inability to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner

please see our results of operations section for additional discussion and analysis of these items 
non gaap financial measures in our quarterly earnings press releases and conference calls  we discuss two key measures that are not calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the first non gaap measure is operating income  as reported on our consolidated statements of operations  excluding certain expenses and benefits  which we refer to as non gaap income from operations 
the second measure calculates non gaap income from operations as a percentage of reported services revenues  which we refer to as non gaap operating margin 
management believes that these non gaap measures help illustrate underlying trends in our business 
we use these measures to establish budgets and operational goals communicated internally and externally  manage our business and evaluate our performance 
we exclude certain expenses and benefits from non gaap income from operations that we believe are not reflective of these underlying business trends and are not useful measures in determining our operational performance and overall business strategy 
because our reported non gaap financial measures are not calculated according to gaap  these measures may not necessarily be comparable to gaap or similarly described non gaap measures reported by other companies 
table of contents within our industry 
consequently  our non gaap financial measures should not be evaluated in isolation or supplant comparable gaap measures  but  rather  should be considered together with our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared according to gaap 
the following table reconciles income from operations as reported on our consolidated statements of operations to non gaap income from operations and non gaap operating margin for  and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  service revenues gaap income from operations stock based compensation expense restructuring and other related charges amortization of purchased intangible assets acquisition costs and other related charges stock based compensation review and restatement benefits non gaap income from operations gaap operating margin effect of adjustments detailed above non gaap operating margin non gaap income from operations increased in compared to  and in compared to  primarily due to the increases in reported gaap income from operations 
during   and  we received insurance recovery proceeds of million  million  and million  respectively  as reimbursement for expenses incurred in and relating to the stock option review and restatement 
when the expenses were originally incurred  they were excluded from our non gaap income from operations 
similarly  these benefits have been excluded from non gaap income from operations in   and please see the results of operations section for a more detailed discussion and analysis of restructuring and other related charges  amortization of purchased intangible assets  and acquisition costs and other related charges 
when important to management s analysis  operating results are compared in constant currency terms  a non gaap financial measure that excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the effect of rate fluctuations is excluded by translating the current period s local currency service revenues and expenses into us dollars at the average exchange rates of the prior period of comparison 
for a discussion of our exposure to exchange rates  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates relied upon in preparing these financial statements include  but are not limited to  estimated costs to complete long term contracts  estimated fair value of investments  including whether any decline in such fair value is other than temporary  estimated fair values of reporting units used to evaluate goodwill for impairment  stock based compensation expenses  restructuring and other related charges  contingent liabilities and recoverability of our net deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
although management regularly assesses these estimates  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 

table of contents a summary of those accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates that we believe are most critical to fully understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from the provision of professional services  digital marketing services and offline printing and production services arrangements with our clients when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided to the client  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
in instances where the client  at its sole discretion  has the right to reject the services prior to final acceptance  revenue is deferred until such acceptance occurs 
we evaluate our contracts for multiple elements  and when appropriate  separate the contracts into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition 
we allocate revenue to the elements in a multiple element arrangement based upon their relative selling prices 
we determine relative selling prices for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available 
if vsoe is not available  third party evidence tpe is used  and if neither vsoe nor tpe is available  the selling price for a deliverable is based on our best estimate of selling price 
in some instances  multiple contracts with a single client are combined for purposes of assessing revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from our fixed price contracts and certain time and materials technology implementation consulting contracts using the percentage of completion method 
we use the percentage of completion method because the services provided in these contracts are similar to services in contracts that are required to use the percentage of completion method under gaap  such as services provided by engineers and architects  for example 
revenues generated from fixed price and time and materials non technology implementation contracts  except for support and maintenance contracts  are recognized based upon a proportional performance model 
our percentage of completion method and our proportional performance method of accounting calculate revenue based on the percentage of labor incurred to estimated total labor 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and labor applicable to various stages of an arrangement can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
revenue from time and materials contracts is recognized as services are provided 
in situations where time and materials contracts require deliverables and provide for a ceiling on fees that can be charged  the arrangement is recognized as time and materials are incurred unless calculated fees are estimated to exceed the ceiling  in which case revenue recognition is based on the proportional performance method 
revenues generated from staff augmentation  support and maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the arrangement s term 
our assignment delivery and business unit finance personnel continually review labor incurred and estimated total labor  which may result in revisions to the amount of recognized revenue under an arrangement 
certain arrangements provide for revenue to be generated based upon the achievement of certain performance standards 
revenue related to achieving such performance standards is recognized when such standards are achieved 
revenue related to the achievement of performance standards was immaterial for all of the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements 
revenues related to our digital marketing media sales are recorded as the net amount of our gross billings less pass through expenses charged to a client 
in most cases  the amount that is billed to clients significantly exceeds the amount of revenue that is earned and reflected in our financial statements  because of various pass through expenses such as production and media costs 
we are required to assess whether the agency or the third party supplier is the primary obligor 
we evaluate the terms of our client agreements as part of this assessment 
in addition  we give appropriate consideration to other key indicators such as latitude in establishing price  discretion in supplier selection and credit risk to the vendor 
because we broadly operate as an advertising agency based on our primary lines of business and given the industry practice to generally record revenue on a 
table of contents net basis  we believe that there must be strong evidence in place to overcome the presumption of net revenue accounting 
accordingly  we record revenue net of pass through charges when we believe the key indicators of the business suggest we generally act as an agent on behalf of our clients in our primary lines of business 
in those businesses where the key indicators suggest we act as a principal  we record the gross amount billed to the client as revenue 
our marketing services  including access to our bridgetrack software application  help our clients optimize their cross platform marketing effectively to track behavior and improve conversion rates through data driven analysis 
these services are provided in exchange for monthly retainer fees and license fees  and revenues are recognized as the monthly services are provided 
revenues from offline printing and production services are recognized at the time title of the related items transfers to our clients  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed for an arrangement or we do not manage the assignment properly within the planned time period  then we may recognize a loss on the arrangement 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted arrangements are made on an arrangement by arrangement basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses are identified 
we have committed unanticipated additional resources to complete assignments in the past  which has resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those arrangements 
we expect that we will experience similar situations in the future 
in addition  we may fix the price for some assignments at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that is too low and  therefore  a corrected estimation could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue for services when collection from the client is reasonably assured  and our fees are fixed or determinable  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we establish billing terms at the time assignment deliverables and milestones are agreed 
our normal payment terms are thirty days from invoice date 
revenues recognized in excess of the amounts invoiced to clients are classified as unbilled revenues 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenue recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
our assignment delivery and business unit finance personnel continually monitor the timeliness of payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities and other financial assets assessing whether a decline in value in available for sale securities is other than temporary requires us to assess whether we intend to sell the security and if it would be more likely than not that we would be required to sell the available for sale security before its cost can be recovered  for reasons such as contractual obligations or working capital needs 
also  we have to assess whether the cost of the available for sale security will be recovered regardless of intent and or requirement to sell 
this assessment requires us to evaluate  among other factors the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health and business outlook of the issuer  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors and overall market conditions and trends 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  declines in fair value  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy is based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value 
those levels are level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

table of contents level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities 
accounting for income taxes we record income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences  operating losses  or tax credit carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we are required to establish a valuation allowance based on whether realization of deferred tax assets is considered to be more likely than not 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reinvest certain earnings of foreign operations indefinitely and  accordingly  we do not provide for income taxes that could result from the remittance of such earnings 
when we can no longer assert indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings  we must provide for income taxes on these amounts 
accounting for income taxes requires a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if  based on the technical merits  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity 
any changes in these factors could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
we record accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets are reviewed for impairment on a regular basis for the existence of facts and circumstances that may suggest that the carrying amount of an asset  or group of assets  may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets or groups of assets is assessed based on a comparison of the carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount  the asset is considered impaired and expense is recorded at an amount required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
determining the fair value of long lived assets includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
we assess the useful lives and possible impairment of long lived assets when an event occurs that may trigger such a review 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred includes significant judgment by management 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  disposition of a significant portion of an operating segment  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
during  we performed two impairment reviews of the customer list intangible asset which we obtained in our acquisition of nitro in these impairment reviews were performed during the second and fourth quarters of and were triggered by certain legacy nitro customers notifying us of their intentions to cease or significantly reduce their purchases of our services 
this caused the actual customer attrition rates experienced since we acquired nitro to exceed the estimated attrition rates utilized in the original valuation of the nitro customer list intangible asset 
this intangible asset has a gross carrying amount of million 
the net book value of this intangible asset was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in estimating the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by this intangible asset  we considered the following factors actual customer attrition rates since the acquisition date  expected future attrition rates  estimated undiscounted net cash flows generated by the intangible asset since the acquisition date  estimated undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the intangible asset over its remaining expected useful life  and the expected remaining useful life of the intangible asset 
our impairment reviews considered multiple future scenarios and the expected likelihood of those scenarios occurring  based on the information which was known to management at the time the reviews were performed 
in both of these impairment reviews  the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the intangible asset were greater than the net book value of the asset at the time of the reviews 
as a result  no impairments of this intangible asset were recorded during these impairment reviews involved the use of significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
in addition  if losses of additional legacy nitro customers in the future exceed our current expectations of future attrition  such losses would be considered triggering events requiring us to perform additional impairment reviews of the customer list intangible asset 
such impairment reviews could result in the recognition of impairment losses  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the period in which such losses are recognized 
we assess goodwill annually during the fourth quarter  or more frequently when events and circumstances  such as the ones mentioned above  occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
in assessing goodwill for impairment  an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if this is the case  then performing the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is unnecessary 
an entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any or all of its reporting units  and proceed directly to the use of the two step impairment test 
in assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we assess relevant events and circumstances that may impact the fair value and the carrying amount of a reporting unit 
the identification of relevant events and circumstances and how these may impact a reporting unit s fair value or carrying amount involve significant judgments by management 
these judgments include the consideration of macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  events which are specific to sapient  and trends in the market price of our common stock 
each factor is assessed to determine whether it impacts the impairment test positively or negatively  and the magnitude of any such impact 
the two step goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of those reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
assets and liabilities  including goodwill  are allocated to reporting units based on factors such as specific identification and percentage of 
table of contents revenue 
to conduct a quantitative two step goodwill impairment test  the fair value of the reporting unit is first compared to its carrying value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we perform the second step and record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using the income approach  via discounted cash flow valuation models which include  but are not limited to  assumptions such as a risk free rate of return on an investment  the weighted average cost of capital of a market participant  and future revenue  operating margin  working capital and capital expenditure trends 
determining the fair values of reporting units and goodwill includes significant judgment by management  and different judgments could yield different results 
we performed the annual assessment of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of  using the qualitative approach described above 
based on our qualitative assessment  we concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair values of any of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts  and therefore it was not necessary to perform the quantitative two step impairment test 
the key qualitative factors that led to our conclusion included the following our impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of showed significant headroom between the fair values and carrying values for each reporting unit  our reporting units continued to show positive performance during  based on our current forecasts for and beyond  we expect continued positive performance for all reporting units  and our market capitalization has not experienced any significant decline in the past year 
in performing our assessment  we determined that one of our reporting units had a negative carrying value 
our conclusion that it was not necessary to perform the two step impairment test for this reporting unit was based on the key factors noted above  in addition to assessing the reasons for the negative carrying value  and performing a sensitivity analysis on the two step impairment test performed for this unit in the prior year 
also  the carrying value of one of our reporting units increased significantly from the prior year due to the two acquisitions which we completed during the performance of the acquired companies since the respective acquisition dates did not provide any contrary indications to our conclusion that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of this reporting unit was less than its carrying amount 
restructuring and other related charges from time to time we establish exit plans for restructuring activities which require that we make estimates as to the nature  timing and amount of the exit costs that we specifically identify 
the consolidation of facilities requires us to make estimates  which include contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for vacated office space and related costs  and estimated sub lease income 
we review our sub lease assumptions and lease buy out assumptions on a regular basis 
these estimates include lease buy out costs  anticipated sub lease rates  other terms and conditions in sub lease contracts  and the timing of these sub lease arrangements 
if the rental markets continue to change  our lease buy out  sub lease and space requirement assumptions may not be accurate  and it is possible that changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
contingent liabilities we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling approximately million  for which the likelihood of a loss is considered more than remote  and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have recorded an accrual at december  of approximately million related to certain of these items for which the likelihood of a loss is considered probable 
although we intend to defend these matters vigorously  the ultimate outcome of these items is uncertain 
however  we do not expect the potential losses  if any  to have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions completed after december  using the acquisition method 
the acquisition method requires us to recognize and measure identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquired entity 
accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates  primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenues and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired 
table of contents assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially impacted by the initial selection of  or changes in  assumptions and estimates used in accounting for prior or future acquisitions 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements

amortization expense related to intangible assets increased from million in to million in due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in expense as the useful economic lives of certain other intangible assets ended 
acquisition costs and other related charges acquisition costs and other related charges are expenses associated with third party professional services we utilize related to the evaluation of potential targets and the execution of successful acquisitions 
although we may incur costs to evaluate targets  the related potential transaction s may never be consummated 
acquisition costs and other related charges also include changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities recorded as the result of acquisitions 
until these liabilities are settled  they must be remeasured to fair value each reporting period  with the changes included in earnings 
acquisition costs and other related charges were million and million for and  respectively 
the increase was due to the fact that two acquisitions occurred during  for which we incurred expenses relating to third party services and remeasurements of the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities  while no acquisitions were completed during we recorded contingent consideration liabilities as the result of our acquisition of d d holdings limited during  and we expect to record quarterly remeasurements of the fair value of these liabilities until they are settled at various points in time through interest and other income the most significant component of interest and other income is interest income 
interest income is derived primarily from investments in us government securities  bank time deposits  and money market funds 
the following table presents interest and other income for and in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase percentage increase interest and other income  net 
table of contents interest and other income increased in primarily due to an increase in interest income  as we had higher average balances of cash and cash equivalents compared to  and  to a lesser extent  an increase in interest rates on our foreign currency cash and cash equivalents 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million and million for and  respectively 
income tax is related to foreign  federal and state tax obligations 
the increase in our provision for income taxes was primarily due to increased profits 
deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as of december   a valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards 
we also maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in switzerland but believe that deferred tax assets in various other foreign jurisdictions are more likely than not to be realized and  therefore  no valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  of approximately million as of december  and million as of december  these amounts represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would result in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
as of december  and  accrued interest and penalties were approximately million and million  respectively 
we conduct business globally and  as a result  one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world  including major jurisdictions such as canada  germany  india  switzerland  the united kingdom and the united states 
our us federal tax filings are open for examination for tax years through the present 
the statutes of limitations in our other tax jurisdictions remain open for various periods between and the present 
however  carryforward attributes from prior years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities if they are used in a future period 
although we believe our tax estimates are appropriate  the final determination of tax audits could result in favorable or unfavorable changes in our estimates 
we anticipate the settlement of tax audits and the expiration of relevant statutes of limitations in the next twelve months could result in a decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits of an amount between million and million 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss by jurisdiction  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 
for  our effective tax rate varied from the statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes  the tax rate differential attributable to income earned by our foreign subsidiaries and the related mix of jurisdictional profits  changes in uncertain tax positions  and changes in deferred taxes on unremitted earnings 
results by operating segment we have discrete financial data by operating segments available based on our method of internal reporting  which disaggregates our operations 
operating segments are defined as components of the company for which separate financial information is available to manage resources and evaluate performance 
beginning in  we realigned our north america and europe operating segments and internal reporting systems into three operating segments to better align our services with our business and operational strategy 
the 
table of contents realigned operating segments were sapientnitro  sapient global markets and sapient government services 
as such  results by operating segment for the year ended december  have been recast to reflect the operating segment unit structure 
we typically do not allocate certain marketing and general and administrative expenses including costs associated with our restructuring events as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  to our operating segments because these activities and costs generally impact areas that support the operating segments and  therefore  are managed separately 
however  in  we allocated million and million of million related to our first quarter reduction in workforce to our sapientnitro and sapient global markets segments  respectively  because all of the people involved provided labor exclusively for one of these two segments 
management does not allocate amortization of purchased intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  acquisition costs and other related charges  or interest and other income to the segments for the review of results by the chief operating decision maker codm 
asset information by operating segment is not reported to or reviewed by the codm  and therefore  we have not disclosed asset information for the operating segments

amortization expense related to intangible assets increased million due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the nitro acquisition  offset by a decrease in expense as the useful economic lives of other intangibles ended 
acquisition costs and other related charges on january   we began accounting for business combinations using the acquisition method which requires acquisition related costs to be expensed as incurred 
these costs include expenses associated with third party professional services we incur related to our evaluation process of potential acquisition opportunities and other related charges

provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is related to foreign  federal and state tax obligations 
the increase in our provision for income taxes was due to higher income before taxes and a higher tax expense rate on our us income due to the release of our valuation allowance on a substantial portion of our us deferred taxes in the fourth quarter of deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december  all of our us deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance of million 
based upon our operating results for the years immediately preceding and through december   as well as an assessment of our expected future results of operations in the us  at december  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in the us as a result  we released our valuation allowances on a substantial portion of our us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of certain state tax net operating loss carryforwards  as well as a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards relating to certain stock based compensation deductions will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them at december  and at december  we determined that it had become more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result  we released million of valuation allowances on our state deferred tax assets  which was recorded as an income tax benefit 
in addition  at december  we established a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets in switzerland  but continue to believe that the deferred tax assets in other foreign subsidiaries are more likely than not to be realized and  therefore  no valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets

investing activities cash used in investing activities during totaled million 
this was primarily due to the use of million net of cash acquired for the acquisitions of dad and clanmo  and the use of million for 
table of contents capital expenditures and internally developed software 
cash used in investing activities increased by million from million in  primarily due to the fact that we used only million for acquisitions in  and capital expenditures increased by million  primarily due to more activity relating to build outs of new or expanded office spaces 
in addition  during we received million from sales and maturities of trading securities  while we had no activity in trading securities during financing activities cash used in financing activities during was million  primarily relating to a million special dividend payment to holders of common stock  net repayments of million under our revolving credit facility in india  and the repayment of million of debt assumed in the acquisition of dad 
these cash outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million in cash proceeds from stock option exercises  and million of tax benefits from stock plans 
cash used in financing activities increased by million from million in  primarily due to an increase of million in net repayments under the india credit facility  and an increase of million in cash dividend payments 
we entered into our india credit facility in in order to finance the build out of a new office in india 
management concluded that this credit facility was the most efficient financing method available 
this credit facility expired december  non cash investing transactions of million and million in and  respectively  reflect the value of shares of common stock issued as contingent consideration in connection with our acquisition of dcg 
we use foreign currency option contracts to partially mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on revenues and operating expenses denominated in certain foreign currencies 
please see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for a discussion of our use of such derivative financial instruments 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made and such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
we are subject to various legal claims totaling million  for which the likelihood of a loss is considered more than remote  and various administrative audits  each of which have arisen in the ordinary course of our business 
we have recorded an accrual at december  of million related to certain of these items for which the likelihood of a loss is considered probable 
during the three months ended september   we made a payment of million to settle a claim which had initially been accrued as a contingent liability during the three months ended march  although we intend to defend these matters vigorously  the ultimate outcome of these matters is uncertain 
however  we do not expect the potential losses  if any  to have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
as of december   our total cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities were million 
this balance included million held by our us entities and million held by our foreign subsidiaries 
if we need to access these overseas funds for our operations in the us  we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds 
however  our intent is to reinvest the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries indefinitely  except for million of unremitted earnings which as of december  were not reinvested indefinitely 
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate any overseas funds to fund our us operations 
we believe that our existing cash  credit facility and other short term investments will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  investing activities and the expected cash outlays for our previously recorded restructuring activities for at least the next months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we account for our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities 
available for sale securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities that are considered temporary are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive loss caption of our consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities are reflected in earnings when the decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
credit losses on debt securities classified as available for sale are an example of other than temporary declines in value and are reflected in the other income  net caption of our consolidated statements of operations 
trading securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in the other income  net caption of our consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated fair value of our marketable securities portfolio was million as of december   which included million of mutual funds and million of auction rate securities ars 
we do not intend to sell the remaining million amortized cost in ars classified as available for sale until a successful auction occurs  nor do we believe that we will be required to sell these securities at less than amortized cost before a successful auction occurs 
the estimated fair value of our marketable securities portfolio was million as of december   which included million of mutual funds and million of ars 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
the market values of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in market interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if market interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  and we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
if the interest rate had fluctuated by  the increase or decrease in value of our marketable securities would not have been material as of december  and our interest income would not have changed by a material amount for the three months ended december  
table of contents exchange rate sensitivity we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates because significant portions of our revenues  expenses  assets  and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the british pound sterling  the euro  the indian rupee and the canadian dollar 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
foreign currency transaction exposure foreign currency transaction exposure is derived primarily from intercompany transactions of a short term nature and transactions with clients or vendors in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity in which the transaction is recorded 
assets and liabilities arising from such transactions are translated into the legal entity s functional currency at each reporting period using period end exchange rates and any resulting gain or loss as a result of currency fluctuations is recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency transaction gains of million and losses of million were recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we mitigate foreign currency transaction exposure by settling these types of transactions in a timely manner where practical  thereby limiting the amount of time that the resulting non functional currency asset or liability remains outstanding and subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
foreign currency translation exposure foreign currency translation exposure is derived from the translation of the financial statements of our subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes 
these subsidiaries balance sheets are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates and their income statements are translated into us dollars using individual transactional exchange rates or average monthly exchange rates 
any difference between the period end exchange rates and the transactional or average monthly rates is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
for  approximately of our revenues and approximately of our operating expenses were generated by subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar and thus subject to foreign currency translation exposure  as compared to and  respectively  for in addition  of our assets and of our liabilities were subject to foreign currency translation exposure as of december   as compared to of our assets and of our liabilities as of december  we also have assets and liabilities in certain entities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity s functional currency and are subject to foreign currency exposure  as described above 
approximately of our operating expenses for was incurred by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the indian rupee 
because we have minimal associated revenues in indian rupees  any significant movement in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the rupee has a significant impact on our operating expenses and operating profit 
approximately  and of our service revenues for were generated by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the british pound sterling  euro and canadian dollar  respectively 
any significant movements in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  the us dollar and the euro  and the us dollar and the canadian dollar have a significant impact on our service revenues and operating income 
we manage these exposures through a risk management program which is designed to mitigate our exposure to operating expenses incurred by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the indian rupee and operating margins in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the british pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
this program includes the use of derivative financial instruments which are not designated as accounting hedges 
as of december   we had option contracts outstanding in the notional amount of approximately million million for our indian rupee contracts  million for our british pound sterling contracts  million for our euro contracts and million for our canadian dollar contracts 
because these instruments are option collars that are settled on a 
table of contents net basis with the counterparty banks  we have not recorded the gross underlying notional amounts in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  the following table presents a summary of our net realized and unrealized gains losses on our option contracts for  and in thousands year ended december  loss gain on foreign exchange option contracts not designated we also performed a sensitivity analysis of the possible losses that could be incurred on these contracts as a result of movements in the respective foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table presents the maximum losses on these unsettled positions that would result from changes of  and in the underlying average exchange rates of the respective foreign currencies in millions maximum losses resulting from changes in underlying average exchange rates of currency indian rupee british pound sterling euro canadian dollar these positions expire in january and february of and therefore  any realized losses in respect to these positions after december  would be recognized in the three months ending march  for additional discussion of the risks we face as a result of foreign currency fluctuations  see risk factors in part i  item a and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this annual report on form k
