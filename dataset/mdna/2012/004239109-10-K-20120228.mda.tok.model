part i item business 
general acadia realty trust the trust was formed on march  as a maryland real estate investment trust reit 
all references to acadia  we  us  our  and company refer to the trust and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit focused primarily on the ownership  acquisition  redevelopment and management of retail properties  including neighborhood and community shopping centers and mixed use properties with retail components 
we currently operate properties  which we own or have an ownership interest in 
these assets are located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas in the united states along the east coast and in chicago and  in total  comprise approximately eight million square feet 
we also have private equity investments in other retail real estate related opportunities in which we have a minority equity interest 
all of our investments are held by  and all of our operations are conducted through  acadia realty limited partnership the operating partnership and entities in which the operating partnership owns a controlling interest 
as of december   the trust controlled of the operating partnership as the sole general partner 
as the general partner  the trust is entitled to share  in proportion to its percentage interest  in the cash distributions and profits and losses of the operating partnership 
the limited partners generally represent entities or individuals which contributed their interests in certain assets or entities to the operating partnership in exchange for common or preferred units of limited partnership interest common op units or preferred op units  respectively  and collectively  op units and employees who have been awarded restricted common op units ltip units as long term incentive compensation 
limited partners holding common op units are generally entitled to exchange their units on a one for one basis for our common shares of beneficial interest common shares 
this structure is referred to as an umbrella partnership reit  or upreit 
business objectives and strategies our primary business objective is to acquire and manage commercial retail properties that will provide cash for distributions to shareholders while also creating the potential for capital appreciation to enhance investor returns 
we focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective own and operate a core portfolio as defined in item of this form k of high quality retail properties located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas and create value through accretive redevelopment and re anchoring activities coupled with the acquisition of high quality assets that have the long term potential to outperform the asset class as part of our core asset recycling and acquisition initiative 
generate additional external growth through an opportunistic yet disciplined acquisition program through our opportunity funds as defined in item of this form k 
we target transactions with high inherent opportunity for the creation of additional value through value add investments in high quality urban and or street retail properties with re tenanting or repositioning opportunities  opportunistic acquisitions of well located real estate anchored by distressed retailers or by motivated sellers and opportunistic purchases of debt which may include restructuring 
these may also include joint ventures with private equity investors for the purpose of making investments in operating retailers with significant embedded value in their real estate assets 
maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth 
investment strategy external growth through core asset recycling acquisition initiative and opportunity fund platform the requirements that acquisitions be accretive on a long term basis based on our cost of capital  as well as increase the overall core portfolio quality and value  are key strategic considerations to our core portfolio asset recycling acquisition program 
as such  we constantly evaluate the blended cost of equity and debt and adjust the amount of acquisition activity to align the level of investment activity with capital flows 
given the growing importance of technology and e commerce  many of our retail tenants are appropriately focused on multi channel sales and how to best utilize e commerce initiatives to drive sales at their stores 
in light of these initiatives  we have found retailers are becoming more selective as to the location  size and format of their next generation stores and are focused on dense  high traffic retail corridors  where they can utilize smaller and more productive formats closer to their shopping population 
accordingly  our focus for core portfolio acquisitions is on those properties which we believe will not only remain relevant to our tenants  but become even more so in the future 
in connection with our core portfolio acquisition activity  we may also engage in discussions with public and private entities regarding business combinations 
in addition to our core portfolio investments in real estate assets  we have also capitalized on our expertise in the acquisition  redevelopment  leasing and management of retail real estate by establishing discretionary opportunity funds in which we earn  in addition to a pro rata return based on our equity interest  a carried interest promote and fees and priority distributions for our services 
to date  we have launched three opportunity funds opportunity funds  acadia strategic opportunity fund  lp fund i  acadia strategic opportunity fund ii  llc fund ii and acadia strategic opportunity fund iii  llc fund iii 
due to the level of our control  we consolidate these opportunity funds for financial reporting purposes 
fund i during september of  we and four of our institutional shareholders formed fund i  and during august of formed a limited liability company  acadia mervyn investors i  llc mervyns i  in which the investors  including the operating partnership  committed a total of million for the purpose of acquiring real estate assets 
the operating partnership is the general partner or managing member with a interest 
in addition to a pro rata return on its invested equity  the operating partnership is entitled to a promote based upon certain investment return thresholds 
cash flow was distributed pro rata to the investors including the operating partnership until they earned a cumulative return preferred return and the return of all of their capital contributions 
fund i investors have received a return of all of their capital invested in fund i and mervyns i and their preferred return 
accordingly  all cash flow is now distributed to the operating partnership as a promote and to the partners including the operating partnership 
the operating partnership also earns fees and or priority distributions for asset management services equal to of the allocated invested equity  as well as for property management  leasing  legal and construction services 
all such fees and priority distributions are eliminated in consolidation and reflected as a reduction in the noncontrolling interest share in income from opportunity funds in the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this form k 
we are currently in the latter stages of our multi year process of monetizing fund i as discussed further in asset sales and capital asset recycling below in this item as of december   there were four assets comprising approximately million square feet remaining in fund i in which the operating partnership s interest in cash flow and income is as a result of the promote 
fund ii following our success with fund i  during june of we formed a second  larger opportunity fund  fund ii  and during august of  formed acadia mervyn investors ii  llc mervyns ii  with the investors from fund i as well as two additional institutional investors  whereby the investors  including the operating partnership  committed capital totaling million 
the operating partnership is the managing member with a interest in fund ii and mervyns ii and can invest the committed equity on a discretionary basis within the parameters defined in the fund ii and mervyns ii operating agreements 
the terms and structure of fund ii and mervyns ii are substantially the same as fund i and mervyns i with the exception that the preferred return is 
as of december   million of fund ii s and mervyns ii s capital was invested and the balance of million is expected to be utilized to complete development activities for existing fund ii investments 
given the market conditions for commercial real estate at the time fund ii was formed  we channeled our acquisition efforts through fund ii in two opportunistic strategies the new york urban infill redevelopment initiative and the retailer controlled property venture  which are more fully described below 
new york urban infill redevelopment initiative during september of  through fund ii  we launched our new york urban infill redevelopment initiative 
in addition to retailer multi channeling initiatives as discussed above  we also believe that retailers continue to recognize that many of the nation s urban markets are under served from a retail standpoint  and we have capitalized on this situation by investing in redevelopment projects in dense urban areas where retail tenant demand has effectively surpassed the supply of available sites 
during  fund ii  together with an unaffiliated partner  formed acadia urban development llc acadia urban development for the purpose of acquiring  constructing  developing  owning  operating  leasing and managing certain retail or mixed use real estate properties in the new york city metropolitan area 
the unaffiliated partner agreed to invest of required capital up to a maximum of million and fund ii  the managing member  agreed to invest the balance to acquire assets in which acadia urban development agreed to invest 
see item of this form k for further information on the acadia urban development joint venture as detailed in liquidity and capital resources new york urban infill redevelopment initiative 
through december   eight of fund ii s nine projects are owned through acadia urban development  as discussed further in property acquisitions new york urban infill redevelopment initiative below in this item retailer controlled property venture the rcp venture during  through funds i and ii or affiliates thereof  we entered into an association  known as the rcp venture  with klaff realty  lp klaff and lubert adler management  inc lubert adler for the purpose of making investments in surplus or underutilized properties owned by retailers 
the rcp venture is neither a single entity nor a specific investment 
any member of this association has the option of participating  or not  in any individual investment and each individual investment has been made on a stand alone basis through a separate limited liability company 
these investments have been made through different investment vehicles with different affiliated and unaffiliated investors and different economics to us 
the initial size of the rcp venture was expected to be approximately million in equity  of which our share would be million 
based on the investment opportunities  the size of the rcp venture could be and was expanded 
mervyns i and ii and fund ii have invested a total of million in the rcp venture to date on a non recourse basis 
investments under the rcp venture are structured as separate joint ventures as there may be other investors participating in certain investments in addition to klaff  lubert adler and us 
while we are not required to invest any additional capital into any of these investments  should additional capital be required and we elect not to contribute our share  our proportionate share in the investment would be reduced 
cash flow from any rcp venture investment is distributed to the participants until they have received a cumulative return on and a full return of all capital contributions 
thereafter  remaining cash flow is distributed to klaff klaff s promote and to the partners including klaff 
as the participants have received a return of all of their capital invested and their unpaid cumulative return  all cash flow is now distributed to klaff as klaff s promote and then to the partners 
the operating partnership may also earn market rate fees for property management  leasing and construction services on behalf of the rcp venture 
while we are primarily a passive partner in the investments made through the rcp venture  historically we have provided our services in reviewing potential acquisitions and operating and redevelopment assistance in areas where we have both a presence and expertise 
we continue to seek to invest opportunistically with the rcp venture primarily in any of the following four ways invest in operating retailers to control their real estate through private equity joint ventures work with financially healthy retailers to create value from their surplus real estate acquire properties  designation rights or other control of real estate or leases associated with retailers in bankruptcy complete sale leasebacks with retailers in need of capital our rcp venture investments are further discussed in property acquisitions rcp venture below in this item fund iii fund iii was formed during with fourteen institutional investors  including a majority of the investors from funds i and ii  whereby the investors  including the operating partnership  committed capital totaling million 
the operating partnership s share of the committed capital is million and it is the sole managing member with a interest in fund iii and can invest the committed equity on a discretionary basis within the parameters defined in the fund iii operating agreement 
the terms and structure of fund iii are substantially the same as fund i and fund ii with the exception that the preferred return is 
as of december   million of fund iii s capital was invested 
to date  fund iii has invested in projects as discussed further in property acquisitions below in this item through fund iii  our acquisition efforts are focused on the investment themes as discussed above in business objectives and strategies in this item in connection with the focus on urban locations  fund iii has invested in a portfolio of self storage facilities located in and around the new york city metropolitan area 
capital strategy balance sheet focus and access to capital our primary capital objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices  including a moderate use of leverage  while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth 
we intend to continue financing acquisitions and property redevelopment with sources of capital determined by management to be the most appropriate based on  among other factors  availability in the current capital markets  pricing and other commercial and financial terms 
the sources of capital may include the issuance of public equity  unsecured debt  mortgage and construction loans  and other capital alternatives including the issuance of op units 
we manage our interest rate risk primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and  where we use variable rate debt  we use certain derivative instruments  including london interbank offered rate libor swap agreements and interest rate caps as discussed further in item a 
of this form k 
during january  we established an at the market atm equity program with an aggregate offering of up to million in common shares 
we intend to use the future net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes  which may include  among other things  repayment of our debt  future acquisitions  directly in the core portfolio and through our opportunity funds  and redevelopments of and capital improvements to our properties 
during november  we issued million common shares  which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were primarily used for general corporate purposes  which included i the repurchase of million of our convertible notes convertible notes payable as discussed further in note to our consolidated financial statements  which begin on page f of this form k  ii additional property acquisitions and investments  including the funding of our capital commitments to our opportunity funds and iii redevelopment and re tenanting activities within our core portfolio 
during april  we issued million common shares and generated net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were primarily used to purchase a portion of our outstanding convertible notes payable as discussed below and pay down existing lines of credit 
operating strategy experienced management team with proven track record our senior management team has decades of experience in the real estate industry 
we believe our management team has demonstrated the ability to create value through anchor recycling  property redevelopment and strategic non core dispositions 
we have capitalized on our expertise in the acquisition  redevelopment  leasing and management of retail real estate by establishing joint ventures  such as the opportunity funds  in which we earn  in addition to a return on our equity interest  promotes  fees and priority distributions 
in connection with these joint ventures we have launched several successful acquisition platforms including our new york urban infill redevelopment initiative and rcp venture 
operating functions such as leasing  property management  construction  finance and legal collectively  the operating departments are generally provided by our personnel  providing for fully integrated property management and development 
by incorporating the operating departments in the acquisition process  acquisitions are appropriately priced giving effect to each asset s specific risks and returns 
also  because of the operating departments involvement with  and corresponding understanding of  the acquisition process  transition time is minimized and management can immediately execute on its strategic plan for each asset 
we typically hold our core portfolio properties for long term investment 
as such  we continuously review the existing portfolio and implement programs to renovate and modernize targeted centers to enhance the property s market position 
this in turn strengthens the competitive position of the leasing program to attract and retain quality tenants  increasing cash flow and consequently property value 
we also periodically identify certain properties for disposition and redeploy the capital to existing centers or acquisitions with greater potential for capital appreciation 
our core portfolio consists primarily of urban street retail properties and neighborhood and community shopping centers located in high barrier to entry supply constrained markets 
the neighborhood and community shopping centers owned in both our core portfolio and through our opportunity funds are principally anchored by supermarkets and necessity based retailers 
we believe these attributes enable our properties to better withstand the current post recessionary period 
during and we sold two non core properties and redeployed capital in part to fund core portfolio acquisitions as further discussed in property acquisitions and asset sales and capital asset recycling below in this item property acquisitions core portfolio see item properties for the definition of our core portfolio

item a 
risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition would likely suffer 
this section includes or refers to certain forward looking statements 
refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on such forward looking statements discussed in the beginning of this form k 
we rely on revenues derived from major tenants 
we derive significant revenues from certain anchor tenants that occupy space in more than one center 
we could be adversely affected in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants  or in the event that any such tenant does not renew its leases as they expire or renews at lower rental rates 
vacated anchor space not only would reduce rental revenues if not re tenanted at the same rental rates but also could adversely affect the entire shopping center because of the loss of the departed anchor tenant s customer drawing power 
loss of customer drawing power also can occur through the exercise of the right that most anchors have to vacate and prevent re tenanting by paying rent for the balance of the lease term going dark as would the departure of a shadow anchor tenant that owns its own property 
in addition  in the event that certain major tenants cease to occupy a property  such an action may result in a significant number of other tenants having the right to terminate their leases  or pay a reduced rent based on a percentage of the tenant s sales  at the affected property  which could adversely affect the future income from such property co tenancy 
see item properties major tenants for quantified information with respect to the percentage of our minimum rents received from major tenants 
we may not be able to renew current leases and the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
upon the expiration of current leases for space located in our properties  we may not be able to re let all or a portion of that space  or the terms of re letting including the cost of concessions to tenants may be less favorable to us than current lease terms 
if we are unable to re let promptly all or a substantial portion of the space located in our properties or if the rental rates we receive upon re letting are significantly lower than current rates  our net income and ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected due to the resulting reduction in revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants in any of our properties upon the expiration of their leases 
see item properties lease expirations in this annual report on form k for additional information as to the scheduled lease expirations in our portfolio 
the current economic environment  while improving  may cause us to lose tenants and may impair our ability to borrow money to purchase properties  refinance existing debt or finance our current redevelopment projects 
our operations and performance depend on general economic conditions  including the health of the consumer 
the us economy recently experienced a financial downturn  with a decline in consumer spending  credit tightening and high unemployment 
this economic downturn has had  and may continue to have  an adverse affect on the businesses of many of our tenants 
we and the opportunity funds may experience higher vacancy rates as well as delays in re leasing vacant space 
the current downturn has had  and may continue to have  an unprecedented impact on the global credit markets 
while we currently believe we have adequate sources of liquidity  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain mortgage loans to purchase additional properties  obtain financing to complete current redevelopment projects  or successfully refinance our properties as loans become due 
to the extent that the availability of credit is limited  it would also adversely impact our notes receivable as counterparties may not be able to obtain the financing required to repay the loans upon maturity 
the bankruptcy of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants or a significant number of our smaller tenants may adversely affect our cash flows and property values 
the bankruptcy of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants causing them to reject their leases  or not renew their leases as they expire  or renew at lower rental rates may adversely affect our cash flows and property values 
furthermore  the impact of vacated anchor space and the potential reduction in customer traffic may adversely impact the balance of tenants at a shopping center 
certain of our tenants have experienced financial difficulties and have filed for bankruptcy under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code chapter bankruptcy 
pursuant to bankruptcy law  tenants have the right to reject their leases 
in the event the tenant exercises this right  the landlord generally has the right to file a claim for lost rent equal to the greater of either one year s rent including tenant expense reimbursements for remaining terms greater than one year  or of the rent remaining under the balance of the lease term  but not to exceed three years rent 
actual amounts to be received in satisfaction of those claims will be subject to the tenant s final plan of reorganization and the availability of funds to pay its creditors 
since january   there have been two significant tenant bankruptcies within our portfolio during february  the united retail group  which owns and operates avenue  filed for protection under chapter bankruptcy 
avenue operates in four locations in our core portfolio  totaling approximately  square feet 
rental revenues from avenue at these four locations totaled million for each the years ended december   and united retail group has neither affirmed nor rejected any of the leases at any of our locations 
on december   the great atlantic pacific tea company  inc a p filed for protection under chapter bankruptcy 
at the time of filing  a p was a tenant in five of our properties 
a p has affirmed three of its leases 
it now operates in two locations in our core portfolio  totaling approximately  square feet 
rental revenues from a p at these two locations totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  a p operates in one fund iii location  totaling approximately  square feet 
rental revenues from a p at this location totaled million for each of the years ended december   and a p has filed a plan of reorganization 
there are risks relating to investments in real estate 
real property investments are subject to multiple risks 
real estate values are affected by a number of factors  including changes in the general economic climate  local conditions such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate in an area  the quality and philosophy of management  competition from other available space  the ability of the owner to provide adequate maintenance and insurance and to control variable operating costs 
shopping centers  in particular  may be affected by changing perceptions of retailers or shoppers regarding the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the shopping center and by the overall climate for the retail industry 
real estate values are also affected by such factors as government regulations  interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under  and changes in  environmental  zoning  tax and other laws 
a significant portion of our income is derived from rental income from real property 
our income and cash flow would be adversely affected if we were unable to rent our vacant space to viable tenants on economically favorable terms 
in the event of default by a tenant  we may experience delays in enforcing  and incur substantial costs to enforce  our rights as a landlord 
in addition  certain significant expenditures associated with each equity investment such as mortgage payments  real estate taxes and maintenance costs are generally not reduced even though there may be a reduction in income from the investment 
our ability to change our portfolio is limited because real estate investments are illiquid 
equity investments in real estate are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changed conditions is limited 
our board of trustees may establish investment criteria or limitations as it deems appropriate  but currently does not limit the number of properties in which we may seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
we could change our investment  disposition and financing policies without a vote of our shareholders 
we could become highly leveraged  resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay distributions 
in addition  the viability of the interest rate hedges we use is subject to the strength of the counterparties 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  indebtedness to support our activities 
neither our declaration of trust nor any policy statement formally adopted by our board of trustees limits either the total amount of indebtedness or the specified percentage of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make distributions 
interest expense on our variable rate debt as of december  would increase by million annually for a basis point increase in interest rates 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt  primarily through interest rate swaps but can use other means 
we enter into interest rate hedging transactions  including interest rate swaps and cap agreements  with counterparties 
there can be no guarantee that the future financial condition of these counterparties will enable them to fulfill their obligations under these agreements 
competition may adversely affect our ability to purchase properties and to attract and retain tenants 
there are numerous commercial developers  real estate companies  financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources than we have that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants who will lease space in our properties 
our competitors include other reits  financial institutions  insurance companies  pension funds  private companies and individuals 
this competition may result in a higher cost for properties than we wish to pay 
in addition  retailers at our properties both in our core portfolio and in the portfolios of the opportunity funds face increasing competition from outlet malls  discount shopping clubs  internet commerce  direct mail and telemarketing  which could i reduce rents payable to us and ii reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties leading to increased vacancy rates at our properties 
we could be adversely affected by poor market conditions where our properties are geographically concentrated 
our performance depends on the economic conditions in markets in which our properties are concentrated 
we have significant exposure to the greater new york region  from which we derive of the annual base rents within our core portfolio and of annual base rents within our opportunity funds portfolios 
our operating results could be adversely affected if market conditions  such as an oversupply of space or a reduction in demand for real estate  in this area occurs 
we have pursued  and may in the future continue to pursue extensive growth opportunities  which may result in significant demands on our operational  administrative and financial resources 
we are pursuing extensive growth opportunities 
this expansion places significant demands on our operational  administrative and financial resources 
the continued growth of our real estate portfolio can be expected to continue to place a significant strain on our resources 
our future performance will depend in part on our ability to successfully attract and retain qualified management personnel to manage the growth and operations of our business 
in addition  the acquired properties may fail to operate at expected levels due to the numerous factors that may affect the value of real estate 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to identify and manage the properties 
our inability to carry out our growth strategy could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our earnings growth strategy is based on the acquisition and development of additional properties  including acquisitions through our operating partnership and co investment programs such as our opportunity funds 
in the context of our business plan  redevelopment generally means an expansion or renovation of an existing property 
the consummation of any future acquisitions will be subject to satisfactory completion of our extensive valuation analysis and due diligence review and to the negotiation of definitive documentation 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to implement our strategy because we may have difficulty finding new properties  negotiating with new or existing tenants or securing acceptable financing 
acquisitions of additional properties entail the risk that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations  including operating and leasing expectations 
redevelopment is subject to numerous risks  including risks of construction delays  cost overruns or uncontrollable events that may increase project costs  new project commencement risks such as the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental approvals and permits  and incurring development costs in connection with projects that are not pursued to completion 
a component of our growth strategy is through private equity type investments made through our rcp venture 
these include investments in operating retailers 
the inability of the retailers to operate profitably would have an adverse impact on income realized from these investments 
through our investments in joint ventures we have also invested in operating businesses that have operational risk in addition to the risks associated with real estate investments  including among other risks  human capital issues  adequate supply of product and material  and merchandising issues 
we operate through a partnership structure  which could have an adverse effect on our ability to manage our assets 
our primary property owning vehicle is the operating partnership  of which we are the general partner 
our acquisition of properties through the operating partnership in exchange for interests in the operating partnership may permit certain tax deferral advantages to limited partners who contribute properties to the operating partnership 
since properties contributed to the operating partnership may have unrealized gain attributable to the difference between the fair market value and adjusted tax basis in such properties prior to contribution  the sale of such properties could cause adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contributed such properties 
although we  as the general partner of the operating partnership  generally have no obligation to consider the tax consequences of our actions to any limited partner  there can be no assurance that the operating partnership will not acquire properties in the future subject to material restrictions designed to minimize the adverse tax consequences to the limited partners who contribute such properties 
such restrictions could result in significantly reduced flexibility to manage our assets 
exclusivity obligation to our opportunity funds 
under the terms of our opportunity funds  we are required to first offer to our current fund  all of our opportunities to acquire retail shopping centers with limited exceptions 
we may only pursue opportunities to acquire retail shopping centers directly if i the ownership of the acquisition opportunity by fund iii would create a material conflict of interest for us  ii we require the acquisition opportunity for a like kind exchange  or iii the consideration payable for the acquisition opportunity is our common shares  op units or other securities 
as a result  we may not be able to make attractive acquisitions directly and instead may only receive a minority interest in such acquisitions through fund iii 
risks of joint ventures 
partnership or joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made solely by us  including the possibility that our partner or co venturer might become bankrupt  and that our partner or co venturer may take action contrary to our instructions  requests  policies or objectives  including our policy with respect to maintaining our qualification as a reit 
other risks of joint venture investments include impasse on decisions  such as a sale  because neither we nor a joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture 
also  there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of our funds that may be invested in joint ventures 
any disputes that may arise between joint venture partners and us may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business 
consequently  actions by or disputes with joint venture partners might result in subjecting properties owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
in addition  we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third party joint venture partners 
during  and  our fund i and mervyns i joint ventures provided promote income 
there can be no assurance that the joint ventures will continue to operate profitably and thus provide additional promote income in the future 
these factors could limit the return that we receive from such investments or cause our cash flows to be lower than our estimates 
in addition  a partner or co venturer may not have access to sufficient capital to satisfy its funding obligations to the joint venture 
market factors could have an adverse effect on our share price and our ability to access the public equity markets 
one of the factors that may influence the trading price of our common shares is the annual dividend rate on our common shares as a percentage of its market price 
an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common shares to seek a higher annual dividend rate  which could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
a decline in our share price  as a result of this or other market factors  could unfavorably impact our ability to raise additional equity in the public markets 
the loss of a key executive officer could have an adverse effect on us 
our success depends on the contribution of key management members 
the loss of the services of kenneth f 
bernstein  president and chief executive officer  or other key executive level employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have obtained key man life insurance for mr 
bernstein 
in addition  we have entered into an employment agreement with mr 
bernstein  however  it can be terminated by mr 
bernstein in his discretion 
we have not entered into employment agreements with other key executive level employees 
our board of trustees may change our investment policy without shareholder approval 
our board of trustees may determine to change our investment and financing policies  our growth strategy and our debt  capitalization  distribution  acquisition  disposition and operating policies 
our board of trustees may establish investment criteria or limitations as it deems appropriate  but currently does not limit the number of properties in which we may seek to invest or on the concentration of investments in any one geographic region 
although our board of trustees has no present intention to revise or amend our strategies and policies  it may do so at any time without a vote by our shareholders 
accordingly  the results of decisions made by our board of trustees and implemented by management may or may not serve the interests of all of our shareholders and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to distribute cash to shareholders or qualify as a reit 
distribution requirements imposed by law limit our operating flexibility 
to maintain our status as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we are generally required to distribute to our shareholders at least of our taxable income for each calendar year 
pursuant to irs pronouncements  up to of such distribution may be made in common shares rather than cash 
our taxable income is determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid and by excluding net capital gains 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our distributions in any year are less than the sum of i of our ordinary income for that year  ii of our capital gain net income for that year and  iii of our undistributed taxable income from prior years 
we intend to continue to make distributions to our shareholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the internal revenue code and to minimize exposure to federal income and nondeductible excise taxes 
differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses in determining our income as well as required debt amortization payments and the capitalization of certain expenses could require us to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a reit 
the distribution requirements also severely limit our ability to retain earnings to acquire and improve properties or retire outstanding debt 
there can be no assurance we have qualified or will remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we have consistently met the requirements for qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended december   and we intend to continue to meet these requirements in the future 
however  qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code  for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations 
no assurance can be given that we have qualified or will remain qualified as a reit 
the internal revenue code provisions and income tax regulations applicable to reits differ significantly from those applicable to other corporations 
the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control can potentially affect our ability to continue to qualify as a reit 
in addition  no assurance can be given that future legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly change the requirements for qualification as a reit or adversely affect the federal income tax consequences of such qualification 
under current law  if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our net taxable income 
in addition  our income would be subject to tax at the regular corporate rates 
we also could be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be significantly reduced for each year in which we do not qualify as a reit 
in that event  we would not be required to continue to make distributions 
although we currently intend to continue to qualify as a reit  it is possible that future economic  market  legal  tax or other considerations may cause us  without the consent of our shareholders  to revoke the reit election or to otherwise take action that would result in disqualification 
limits on ownership of our capital shares 
for us to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  among other requirements  not more than of the value of our capital shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities during the last half of each taxable year after  and such capital shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year in each case  other than the first such year 
our declaration of trust includes certain restrictions regarding transfers of our capital shares and ownership limits that are intended to assist us in satisfying these limitations  among other purposes 
these restrictions and limits may not be adequate in all cases  however  to prevent the transfer of our capital shares in violation of the ownership limitations 
the ownership limit discussed above may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing someone from taking control of us 
actual or constructive ownership of our capital shares in excess of the share ownership limits contained in our declaration of trust would cause the violative transfer or ownership to be null and void from the beginning and subject to purchase by us at a price equal to the fair market value of such shares determined in accordance with the rules set forth in our declaration of trust 
as a result  if a violative transfer were made  the recipient of the shares would not acquire any economic or voting rights attributable to the transferred shares 
additionally  the constructive ownership rules for these limits are complex and groups of related individuals or entities may be deemed a single owner and consequently in violation of the share ownership limits 
concentration of ownership by certain investors 
as of december   eight institutional shareholders own or more individually  and in the aggregate  of our common shares 
a significant concentration of ownership may allow an investor or a group of investors to exert a greater influence over our management and affairs and may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us 
restrictions on a potential change of control 
our board of trustees is authorized by our declaration of trust to establish and issue one or more series of preferred shares without shareholder approval 
we have not established any series of preferred shares 
however  the establishment and issuance of a series of preferred shares could make more difficult a change of control of us that could be in the best interests of the shareholders 
in addition  we have entered into an employment agreement with our chief executive officer and severance agreements are in place with our executives which provide that  upon the occurrence of a change in control of us and either the termination of their employment without cause as defined or their resignation for good reason as defined  those executive officers would be entitled to certain termination or severance payments made by us which may include a lump sum payment equal to defined percentages of annual salary and prior years average bonuses  paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of the respective agreement  which could deter a change of control of us that could be in the best interests of the shareholders 
certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
under the maryland general corporation law  as amended  which we refer to as the mgcl  as applicable to reits  certain business combinations  including certain mergers  consolidations  share exchanges and asset transfers and certain issuances and reclassifications of equity securities  between a maryland reit and any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the trust s outstanding voting shares or an affiliate or an associate  as defined in the mgcl  of the trust who  at any time within the two year period immediately prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of beneficial interest of the trust  which we refer to as an interested shareholder  or an affiliate of the interested shareholder  are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder 
after that five year period  any such business combination must be recommended by the board of trustees of the trust and approved by the affirmative vote of at least of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares of beneficial interest of the trust and two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting shares of the trust other than shares held by the interested shareholder with whom  or with whose affiliate  the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested shareholder  unless  among other conditions  the trust s common shareholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the mgcl  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
these provisions of the mgcl do not apply  however  to business combinations that are approved or exempted by the board of trustees of the trust before the interested shareholder becomes an interested shareholder  and a person is not an interested shareholder if the board of trustees approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested shareholder 
in approving a transaction  our board of trustees may provide that its approval is subject to compliance  at or after the time of approval  with any terms and conditions determined by the board 
the mgcl also provides that holders of control shares of a maryland reit defined as voting shares that  when aggregated with all other shares owned by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing trustees acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of control shares have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding shares owned by the acquirer  by officers or by employees who are also trustees of the trust 
our bylaws provide that the control share acquisition statute shall not apply to shares acquired or owned  directly or indirectly  by any person acting in concert with any group as defined in section of the exchange act and the rules thereunder 
our bylaws can be amended by our board of trustees by majority vote  and there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 
additionally  title  subtitle of the mgcl permits our board of trustees  without shareholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our declaration of trust or bylaws  to elect to be subject to certain provisions relating to corporate governance that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our shareholders 
we are subject to some of these provisions for example  a two thirds vote requirement for removing a trustee by provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws unrelated to subtitle becoming subject to  or the potential to become subject to  these provisions of the mgcl could inhibit  delay or prevent a transaction or a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our shareholders or otherwise be in our or their best interests 
in addition  the provisions of our declaration of trust on removal of trustees and the provisions of our bylaws regarding advance notice of shareholder nominations of trustees and other business proposals and restricting shareholder action outside of a shareholders meeting unless such action is taken by unanimous written consent could have a similar effect 
our rights and shareholders rights to take action against trustees and officers are limited  which could limit recourse in the event of actions not in the best interests of shareholders 
as permitted by maryland law  our declaration of trust eliminates the liability of our trustees and officers to the company and its shareholders for money damages  except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or a final judgment based upon a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the trustee or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
in addition  our declaration of trust authorizes  and our bylaws obligate  us to indemnify each present or former trustee or officer  to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law  who is made a party to any proceeding because of his or her service to our company 
as part of these indemnification obligations  we may be obligated to fund the defense costs incurred by our trustees and officers 
legislative or regulatory tax changes could have an adverse effect on us 
there are a number of issues associated with an investment in a reit that are related to the federal income tax laws  including  but not limited to  the consequences of our failing to continue to qualify as a reit 
at any time  the federal income tax laws governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended or modified 
any new laws or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect us or our shareholders 
reduced tax rates applicable to certain corporate dividends paid to most domestic noncorporate shareholders are not generally available to reit shareholders since a reits income generally is not subject to corporate level tax 
as a result  investment in non reit corporations may be viewed as relatively more attractive than investment in reits by domestic noncorporate investors 
this could adversely affect the market price of our shares 
our development and construction activities could affect our operating results 
we intend to continue the selective development and construction of retail properties  with our project at citypoint currently being our largest development project see item business property acquisitions opportunity funds fund ii new york urban infill redevelopment initiative under construction for a description of the citypoint project 
as opportunities arise  we expect to delay construction until sufficient pre leasing is reached and financing is in place 
our development and construction activities include risks that we may abandon development opportunities after expending resources to determine feasibility  construction costs of a project may exceed our original estimates  occupancy rates and rents at a newly completed property may not be sufficient to make the property profitable  financing for development of a property may not be available to us on favorable terms  we may not complete construction and lease up on schedule  resulting in increased debt service expense and construction costs  and we may not be able to obtain  or may experience delays in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
additionally  the time frame required for development  construction and lease up of these properties means that we may not realize a significant cash return for several years 
if any of the above events occur  the development of properties may hinder our growth and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  new development activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require substantial time and attention from management 
redevelopments and acquisitions may fail to perform as expected 
our investment strategy includes the redevelopment and acquisition of shopping centers in supply constrained markets in densely populated areas with high average household incomes and significant barriers to entry 
the redevelopment and acquisition of properties entails risks that include the following  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to meet our obligations the property may fail to achieve the returns we have projected  either temporarily or for extended periods  we may not be able to identify suitable properties to acquire or may be unable to complete the acquisition of the properties we identify  we may not be able to integrate an acquisition into our existing operations successfully  properties we redevelop or acquire may fail to achieve the occupancy or rental rates we project  within the time frames we project  at the time we make the decision to invest  which may result in the properties failure to achieve the returns we projected  our pre acquisition evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment may not detect certain defects or identify necessary repairs until after the property is acquired  which could significantly increase our total acquisition costs or decrease cash flow from the property  and our investigation of a property or building prior to our acquisition  and any representations we may receive from the seller of such building or property  may fail to reveal various liabilities  which could reduce the cash flow from the property or increase our acquisition cost 
climate change and catastrophic risk from natural perils 
some of our current properties could be subject to potential natural or other disasters 
we may acquire properties that are located in areas which are subject to natural disasters 
any properties located in coastal regions would therefore be affected by any future increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of hurricanes and tropical storms  whether such increases are caused by global climate changes or other factors 
climate change is a long term change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns over periods of time that range from decades to millions of years 
it may be a change in the average weather conditions or a change in the distribution of weather events with respect to an average  for example  greater or fewer extreme weather events 
climate change may be limited to a specific region  or may occur across the whole earth 
there may be significant physical effects of climate change that have the potential to have a material effect on our business and operations 
these effects can impact our personnel  physical assets  tenants and overall operations 
physical impacts of climate change may include increased storm intensity and severity of weather eg  floods or hurricanes  sea level rise  and extreme temperatures 
as a result of these physical impacts from climate related events  we may be vulnerable to the following risks of property damage to our shopping centers  indirect financial and operational impacts from disruptions to the operations of major tenants located in our shopping centers from severe weather  such as hurricanes or floods  increased insurance premiums and deductibles  or a decrease in the availability of coverage  for properties in areas subject to severe weather  increased insurance claims and liabilities  increases in energy costs impacting operational returns  changes in the availability or quality of water  or other natural resources on which the tenant s business depends  decreased consumer demand for consumer products or services resulting from physical changes associated with climate change eg  warmer temperatures or decreasing shoreline could reduce demand for residential and commercial properties previously viewed as desirable  incorrect long term valuation of an equity investment due to changing conditions not previously anticipated at the time of the investment  and economic disruptions arising from the above 
possible liability relating to environmental matters 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations  as an owner of real property  we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at  on  in or under our property  as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances including government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property 
these laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence or disposal of those substances 
this liability may be imposed on us in connection with the activities of an operator of  or tenant at  the property 
the cost of any required remediation  removal  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the value of the property and or our aggregate assets 
in addition  the presence of those substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remove those substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent that property or to borrow using that property as collateral  which  in turn  could reduce our revenues and affect our ability to make distributions 
a property can also be adversely affected either through physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances  or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties 
although our tenants are primarily responsible for any environmental damages and claims related to the leased premises  in the event of the bankruptcy or inability of any of our tenants to satisfy any obligations with respect to the property leased to that tenant  we may be required to satisfy such obligations 
in addition  we may be held directly liable for any such damages or claims irrespective of the provisions of any lease 
from time to time  in connection with the conduct of our business  and prior to the acquisition of any property from a third party or as required by our financing sources  we authorize the preparation of phase i environmental reports and  when necessary  phase ii environmental reports  with respect to our properties 
based upon these environmental reports and our ongoing review of our properties  we are currently not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of our properties that we believe would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us 
there can be no assurance  however  that the environmental reports will reveal all environmental conditions at our properties or that the following will not expose us to material liability in the future the discovery of previously unknown environmental conditions  changes in law  activities of tenants  and activities relating to properties in the vicinity of our properties 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of our tenants  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
uninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect our financial condition 
we carry comprehensive general liability  fire  extended coverage  loss of rent insurance  and environmental liability on most of our properties  with policy specifications and insured limits customarily carried for similar properties 
however  with respect to those properties where the leases do not provide for abatement of rent under any circumstances  we generally do not maintain loss of rent insurance 
in addition  there are certain types of losses  such as losses resulting from wars  terrorism or acts of god that generally are not insured because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose capital invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenues from a property  while remaining obligated for any mortgage indebtedness or other financial obligations related to the property 
any loss of these types would adversely affect our financial condition 
future terrorist attacks or civil unrest could harm the demand for  and the value of  our properties 
future terrorist attacks or civil unrest  such as the attacks that occurred in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   and other acts of terrorism or war  could harm the demand for  and the value of  our properties 
terrorist attacks could directly impact the value of our properties through damage  destruction  loss or increased security costs  and the availability of insurance for such acts may be limited or may be subject to substantial cost increases 
to the extent that our tenants are impacted by future attacks  their ability to continue to honor obligations under their existing leases could be adversely affected 
a decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or re lease our properties at lease rates equal to or above historical rates 
these acts might erode business and consumer confidence and spending  and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies 
any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate  decrease or delay the occupancy of our properties  and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 
outages  computer viruses and similar events could disrupt our operations 
we rely on information technology networks and systems  some of which are owned and operated by third parties  to process  transmit and store electronic information 
any of these systems may be susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  terrorist attacks and similar events 
despite the implementation of network security measures  our systems and those of third parties on which we rely may also be vulnerable to computer viruses and similar disruptions 
if we and the third parties on whom we rely are unable to prevent such outages and breaches  our operations could be disrupted

item properties 
shopping center properties the discussion and tables in this item include properties held through our core portfolio and our opportunity funds 
we define our core portfolio as those properties either owned by  or partially owned through joint venture interests by  the operating partnership  or subsidiaries thereof  not including those properties owned through our opportunity funds 
the discussion of the opportunity funds does not include our investment in a portfolio of self storage properties  which are detailed separately within this item as of december   there are operating properties in our core portfolio totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area gla 
the core portfolio properties are located in states and the district of columbia and are generally well established urban street retail locations and community and neighborhood shopping centers 
our shopping centers are predominately anchored by supermarkets or value oriented retail 
the properties are diverse in size  ranging from approximately  to  square feet and as of december   were  in total  occupied 
as of december   we owned and operated properties totaling million square feet of gla in our opportunity funds  excluding three properties under redevelopment 
in addition to shopping centers  the opportunity funds have invested in mixed use properties  which generally include retail activities and self storage properties 
the opportunity fund properties are located in nine states and as of december   were  in total  occupied 
within our core portfolio and opportunity funds  we had approximately leases as of december  a majority of our rental revenues were from national retailers 
a majority of the income from the properties consists of rent received under long term leases 
these leases generally provide for the payment of fixed minimum rent monthly in advance and for the payment by tenants of a pro rata share of the real estate taxes  insurance  utilities and common area maintenance of the shopping centers 
minimum rents and expense reimbursements accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  certain of our leases also provided for the payment of percentage rents either in addition to  or in place of  minimum rents 
these arrangements generally provide for payment to us of a certain percentage of a tenant s gross sales in excess of a stipulated annual amount 
percentage rents accounted for less than of our total revenues 
three of our core portfolio properties and six of our opportunity fund properties are subject to long term ground leases in which a third party owns and has leased the underlying land to us 
we pay rent for the use of the land and are responsible for all costs and expenses associated with the building and improvements at all nine locations

we are involved in various matters of litigation arising in the normal course of business 
while we are unable to predict with any certainty the amounts involved  management is of the opinion that  when such litigation is resolved  our resulting exposure to loss contingencies  if any  will not have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity 
in addition to the foregoing  we are currently involved in the following litigation matters in september  the company  certain of its subsidiaries  and other unrelated entities the investor consortium were named as defendants in an adversary proceeding brought by mervyn s llc mervyns in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
the action involves five claims alleging fraudulent transfers in which mervyns is nominally seeking approximately billion in damages from the investor consortium  although the actual claims made by the administrator and the unsecured creditors are substantially less 
the first claim contends that  at the time of the sale of mervyns by target corporation to the investor consortium  a transfer of assets was made in an effort to defraud creditors 
the company believes that this aspect of the case is without merit 
the remaining four claims relate to transfers of assets of mervyns at various times after the sale by target 
the company believes that there are substantial defenses to these claims and intends to continue to defend them vigorously 
this matter is in the early stages of discovery 
the parties to this action have agreed to a non binding mediation  which is scheduled for the end of march  because of the inherently unpredictable nature of litigation  the company could incur some amount of liability in connection with this matter 
however  at the present time  there have not been sufficient developments in this matter for us to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that the company might incur as a result of this matter 
during august  we terminated the employment of a former senior vice president the former employee for engaging in conduct that fell within the definition of cause in his severance agreement with us 
had the former employee not been terminated for cause  he would have been eligible to receive approximately million under the severance agreement 
because we terminated him for cause  we did not pay the former employee any severance benefits under the agreement 
the former employee has brought a lawsuit against us in new york state supreme court  alleging breach of the severance agreement 
the suit is in the pre trial discovery stage 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the suit

item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview as of december   we operated properties  which we own or have an ownership interest in  within our core portfolio or within our three opportunity funds 
our core portfolio consists of those properties either owned by  or partially owned through joint venture interests by the operating partnership  or subsidiaries thereof  not including those properties owned through our opportunity funds 
these properties consist of commercial properties  primarily urban street retail locations  neighborhood and community shopping centers  mixed use properties with a retail component and urban self storage locations 
the properties we operate are located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas in the united states along the east coast and in chicago 
there are properties in our core portfolio totaling approximately million square feet 
fund i has four remaining properties comprising approximately million square feet 
fund ii has nine properties  seven of which representing million square feet are currently operating  one is under construction  and one is in the design phase 
three of the properties also include a self storage component 
we expect the fund ii portfolio will have approximately million square feet upon completion of all current construction and anticipated redevelopment activities 
fund iii has properties totaling approximately million square feet  of which locations representing million net rentable square feet are self storage facilities 
the majority of our operating income is derived from rental revenues from these properties  including recoveries from tenants  offset by operating and overhead expenses 
as our rcp venture invests in operating companies  we consider these investments to be private equity style  as opposed to real estate  investments 
since these are not traditional investments in operating rental real estate but investments in operating businesses  the operating partnership invests in these through a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
our primary business objective is to acquire and manage commercial retail properties that will provide cash for distributions to shareholders while also creating the potential for capital appreciation to enhance investor returns 
we focus on the following fundamentals to achieve this objective own and operate a core portfolio as defined in item of this form k of high quality retail properties located primarily in high barrier to entry  densely populated metropolitan areas and create value through accretive redevelopment and re anchoring activities coupled with the acquisition of high quality assets that have the long term potential to outperform the asset class as part of our core asset recycling and acquisition initiative 
generate additional external growth through an opportunistic yet disciplined acquisition program through our opportunity funds as defined in item of this form k 
we target transactions with high inherent opportunity for the creation of additional value through value add investments in high quality urban and or street retail properties with re tenanting or repositioning opportunities  opportunistic acquisitions of well located real estate anchored by distressed retailers or by motivated sellers and opportunistic purchases of debt which may include restructuring 
these may also include joint ventures with private equity investors for the purpose of making investments in operating retailers with significant embedded value in their real estate assets 
maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet through conservative financial practices while ensuring access to sufficient capital to fund future growth 
business outlook the us economy is currently in a post recessionary period 
the recession resulted in a significant decline in retail sales due to reduced consumer spending 
although the occupancy and net operating income within our portfolio has not been materially adversely affected through december   should the overall economy again decline  we would expect retailers to experience deteriorating sales performance  and the likelihood of additional tenant bankruptcy filings may increase  which would negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition to the impact on retailers  the recession had a significant impact on the us credit markets 
some sources of financing  such as the commercial mortgage backed security market  are still severely curtailed 
if economic conditions again deteriorate  our ability to finance new acquisitions or refinance existing debts as they mature could be adversely affected 
accordingly  our ability to generate external growth in income  as well as maintain existing operating income  could be limited 
see the item a 
risk factors  including the discussions under the headings the current economic environment  while improving  may cause us to lose tenants and may impair our ability to borrow money to purchase properties  refinance existing debt or finance our current redevelopment projects and the bankruptcy of  or a downturn in the business of  any of our major tenants or a significant number of our smaller tenants may adversely affect our cash flows and property values

it is helpful as it excludes various items included in net income that are not indicative of the operating performance  such as gains losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization 
however  our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash needs  including distributions 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income for the purpose of evaluating our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
consistent with the nareit definition  we define ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
this item represents our share of an extraordinary gain from our investment in albertson s  which recorded an extraordinary gain in connection with the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired

the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of property held for use and sale on a quarterly basis  we review the carrying value of both properties held for use and for sale 
we perform an impairment analysis by calculating and reviewing net operating income on a property by property basis 
we evaluate leasing projections and perform other analyses to conclude whether an asset is impaired 
we record impairment losses and reduce the carrying value of properties when indicators of impairment are present and the expected undiscounted cash flows related to those properties are less than their carrying amounts 
in cases where we do not expect to recover our carrying costs on properties held for use  we reduce our carrying cost to fair value 
for properties held for sale  we reduce our carrying value to the fair value less costs to sell 
during the year ended december   we determined that the value of the granville centre owned by fund i was impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment loss of million 
for the years ended december  and  no impairment losses on our properties were recognized 
management does not believe that the value of any properties in its portfolio was impaired as of december  investments in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures we periodically review our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for other than temporary declines in market value 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered in the next twelve months is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment reserve related to a fund i unconsolidated joint venture 
no impairment charges related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures were recognized for the years ended december  and bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make payments on arrearages in billed rents  as well as the likelihood that tenants will not have the ability to make payments on unbilled rents including estimated expense recoveries 
we also maintain a reserve for straight line rent receivables 
for the years ended december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our tenants were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
real estate real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties  as well as significant renovations are capitalized 
interest costs are capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
construction in progress includes costs for significant property expansion and redevelopment 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  the shorter of the useful life or lease term for tenant improvements and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired assets including land  buildings and improvements  and identified intangibles such as above and below market leases and acquired in place leases and customer relationships and acquired liabilities in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic business combinations and asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  and allocate purchase price based on these assessments 
we assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known trends  and market economic conditions that may affect the property 
involuntary conversion of asset we experienced significant flooding resulting in extensive damage to one of its properties during september costs related to the clean up and redevelopment are insured to a limit sufficient that we believe will allow for full restoration of the property 
loss of rents during the redevelopment are covered by business interruption insurance subject to a million deductible 
we plan to restore the improvements that were damaged by the flooding and expects that the costs of such restoration and rebuilding will be recoverable from insurance proceeds 
in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment and as a result of the above described property damage  we have recorded a write down of the asset s carrying value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of approximately million 
in addition  we have recorded an insurance recovery in the same amount that is included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also provided a million provision in the consolidated statement of income for its exposure to the insurance deductible attributable to the loss of rents 
as of december   we have received initial insurance proceeds of approximately million 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the respective leases  beginning when the tenant takes possession of the space 
certain of these leases also provide for percentage rents based upon the level of sales achieved by the tenant 
percentage rent is recognized in the period when the tenants sales breakpoint is met 
in addition  leases typically provide for the reimbursement to us of real estate taxes  insurance and other property operating expenses 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred 
we make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable related to tenant revenues 
an allowance for doubtful accounts has been provided against certain tenant accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible 
see bad debts above 
once the amount is ultimately deemed to be uncollectible  it is written off 
notes receivable and preferred equity investment real estate notes receivable and preferred equity investments are intended to be held to maturity and are carried at cost 
interest income from notes receivable and preferred equity investments are recognized on the effective interest method over the expected life of the loan 
under the effective interest method  interest or fees to be collected at the origination of the loan or the payoff of the loan is recognized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to yield 
allowances for real estate notes receivable and preferred equity investments are established based upon management s quarterly review of the investments 
in performing this review  management considers the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors  including the fair value of any collateral  the amount and status of any senior debt  and the prospects for the borrower 
because this determination is based upon projections of future economic events  which are inherently subjective  the amounts ultimately realized from the loans may differ materially from the carrying value at the balance sheet date 
interest income recognition is generally suspended for loans when  in the opinion of management  a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the suspended loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
during  we provided a million reserve on a note receivable as a result of the loss of an anchor tenant at the underlying collateral property 
inflation our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our net income 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rents based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or  in certain cases  escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indexes 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits us to seek to increase rents upon re rental at market rates if current rents are below the then existing market rates 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk information as of december  our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates related to our mortgage debt 
see note to our consolidated financial statements  which begin on page f of this form k  for certain quantitative details related to our mortgage debt 
currently  we manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates primarily through the use of fixed rate debt and interest rate swap agreements 
as of december   we had total mortgage and convertible notes payable of million of which million  or was fixed rate  inclusive of debt with rates fixed through the use of derivative financial instruments  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor rates plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to five interest rate swap transactions and three interest rate caps transaction to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million and million of libor based variable rate debt  respectively

after giving effect to noncontrolling interests  our share of this increase would be million 
interest expense on our variable debt of million  net of variable to fixed rate swap agreements currently in effect  as of december  would increase million if libor increased by basis points 
after giving effect to noncontrolling interests  our share of this increase would be million 
we may seek additional variable rate financing if and when pricing and other commercial and financial terms warrant 
as such  we would consider hedging against the interest rate risk related to such additional variable rate debt through interest rate swaps and protection agreements  or other means 
based on our outstanding debt balances as of december   the fair value of our total consolidated outstanding debt would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increase by 
conversely  if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would increase by approximately million 
as of december  and  we had notes receivable and preferred equity investments of million and million  respectively 
we determined the estimated fair value of our notes receivable and preferred equity investments as of december  and were million and million  respectively  by discounting future cash receipts utilizing a discount rate equivalent to the rate at which similar notes receivable would be originated under conditions then existing 
based on our outstanding notes receivable and preferred equity investments balances as of december   the fair value of our total outstanding notes receivable and preferred equity investments would decrease by approximately million if interest rates increase by 
conversely  if interest rates decrease by  the fair value of our total outstanding notes receivable and preferred equity investments would increase by approximately million 
summarized information as of december  as of december   we had total mortgage and convertible notes payable of million of which million  or was fixed rate  inclusive of interest rate swaps  and million  or  was variable rate based upon libor plus certain spreads 
as of december   we were a party to seven interest rate swap transactions and one interest rate cap transaction to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million and million of libor based variable rate debt  respectively 
interest expense on our variable debt of million as of december  would have increased million if libor increased by basis points 
based on our outstanding debt balances as of december   the fair value of our total outstanding debt would have decreased by approximately million if interest rates increased by 
conversely  if interest rates decreased by  the fair value of our total outstanding debt would have increased by approximately million 
changes in market risk exposures from to our interest rate risk exposure from december  to december  has increased  as we had million in variable rate debt or of our total debt at december   as compared to million or of our total debt in variable rate debt at december
