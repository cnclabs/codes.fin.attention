item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all references to notes in this item refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
certain statements in this report constitute forward looking statements 
see special note regarding forward looking statements in item of this report for factors relating to these statements and see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are an integrated communications company engaged primarily in providing an array of communications services to our residential  business  governmental and wholesale customers 
our communications services include local and long distance  network access  private line including special access  public access  broadband  data  managed hosting including cloud hosting  colocation  wireless and video services 
in certain local and regional markets  we also provide local access and fiber transport services to competitive local exchange carriers and security monitoring 
we strive to maintain our customer relationships by  among other things  bundling our service offerings to provide our customers with a complete offering of integrated communications services 
at december   we operated million access lines in states  and served million broadband subscribers 
during  we updated our methodology for counting access lines and broadband subscribers 
our access line methodology includes only those access lines that we use to provide services to external customers and excludes lines used solely by us and our affiliates 
our methodology also excludes unbundled loops and includes stand alone broadband subscribers 
our methodology for counting access lines may not be comparable to those of other companies 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of centurylink  inc centurylink and its majority owned subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries include savvis  inc savvis as of july   qwest communications international inc qwest as of april  and embarq corporation embarq as of july  see note acquisitions 
due to the significant size of these acquisitions  direct comparisons of our results of operations for the years ended december   and are less meaningful than usual 
we discuss below  under segment results  certain trends that we believe are significant  even if they are not necessarily material to the combined company 
in the discussion that follows  we refer to the business that we operated prior to the qwest acquisition including embarq s business as legacy centurylink and refer to the incremental business activities that we now operate as a result of the savvis acquisition as legacy savvis and the qwest acquisition as legacy qwest 
due to the magnitude of our recent acquisitions in relation to legacy centurylink operations  in the combined company variance discussions below we have separately reflected the impacts of both the legacy qwest and legacy savvis operations for enhanced visibility  although we actively manage the combined company through our four segments  as discussed further below 
we have incurred operating expenses related to our acquisitions of savvis in july  qwest in april and embarq in july these expenses are reflected in cost of services and products and 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations as summarized below 
years ended december  dollars in millions cost of services and products integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions severance expenses  accelerated recognition of share based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions selling  general and administrative expenses incurred to effect acquisitions integration and other expenses associated with acquisitions severance expenses  accelerated recognition of share based awards and retention compensation associated with acquisitions this table does not include costs incurred by qwest or savvis prior to being acquired by us 
based on current plans and information  we estimate that  in relation to our qwest acquisition  we will incur approximately million to billion of operating expenses associated with transaction and integration costs which includes approximately million of the expenses noted above and approximately million of capital expenditures associated with integration activities which includes approximately million of capital expenditures incurred through december  
upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting effective july   we recorded a one time  non cash extraordinary gain that aggregated approximately million before income tax expense million after tax 
see note discontinuance of regulatory accounting for more information 
for several years prior to  we reported our operations as a single segment 
in connection with our acquisitions of savvis on july  and qwest on april   we have reorganized our business into the following operating segments regional markets  which consists primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers  small to medium sized businesses and regional enterprise customers  business markets  which consists primarily of providing products and services to enterprise and government customers  wholesale markets  which consists primarily of providing products and services to other communications providers  and savvis operations  which consists primarily of providing hosting and network services primarily to business customers provided by legacy savvis 
the business markets segment currently provides some of the same services as our savvis operations segment  and we may reclassify in the future the revenues and expenses associated with those services as part of our savvis operations segment 
we will continue to classify those services as part of the business markets segment until we are able to further integrate legacy savvis 

table of contents due to system limitations  it is impracticable to report segment information using our current segment view 
as such  only financial data has been revised under our new segment structure described above 
we now report financial information separately for each of these segments  however  our segment information does not include capital expenditures  total assets  or certain revenues and expenses that we manage on a centralized basis 
as we continue to integrate our recent acquisitions  we may make further changes to the way we assess performance and make decisions about allocating resources  which could change our segment reporting 
our segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that our segments would have achieved had they operated as stand alone entities during the periods presented 
for additional information about our segments  see note segment information and results of operations segment results below 
results of operations the following table summarizes the results of our consolidated operations for the years ended december   and  presented in a manner that we believe will be useful for understanding the relevant trends affecting our business 
our operating results include operations of savvis for periods after july   qwest for periods after april  and embarq for periods after july  years ended december  dollars in millions except per share amounts operating revenues operating expenses operating income other income expense income tax expense extraordinary item  net of income tax expense net income employees basic and diluted earnings per common share before extraordinary item extraordinary item basic and diluted earnings per common share the lower levels of net income in were primarily attributable to the acquisition of qwest as of april   which resulted in substantial acquisition  severance and integration expenses  as presented in the table under the overview section above 
legacy savvis and legacy qwest s post acquisition operations  which included substantial severance and integration expenses and significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense based on preliminary valuation estimates see note acquisitions and note goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets  did not contribute significantly to our consolidated net income in our current preliminary valuation estimates of our recently acquired assets and liabilities are subject to change as we finalize our estimates of acquisition date fair value  including those related to assets under capital leases  which may result in material changes to depreciation 
table of contents expense 
within our legacy centurylink business  growth in strategic services revenues which we describe further below did not fully offset lower revenues from other services and products  further contributing to the decreases in consolidated net income 
diluted earnings per common share in was substantially lower than the amounts for the corresponding periods of and due to decreases in net income  as well as increases in the weighted average number of outstanding common shares 
the increase in outstanding shares during was primarily attributable to the issuance of million shares in connection with the qwest acquisition on april  and the issuance of million shares in connection with the savvis acquisition on july  the following table summarizes our broadband subscribers and access lines years ended december  in thousands operational metrics broadband subscribers access lines during the last several years  we have experienced revenue declines primarily due to declines in access lines  intrastate access rates and minutes of use 
prior to our acquisition  qwest had experienced similar declines in its revenues 
to mitigate these declines  we remain focused on efforts to  among other things promote long term relationships with our customers through bundling of integrated services  provide new services  such as video  cloud hosting  managed hosting  colocation services and other additional services that may become available in the future due to advances in technology  wireless spectrum sales by the fcc or improvements in our infrastructure  provide our broadband and premium services to a higher percentage of our customers  pursue acquisitions of additional communications properties if available at attractive prices  increase usage of our networks  and market our products and services to new customers 
operating revenues during  we revised the way we categorize our products and services 
we currently categorize our products  services and revenues among the following four categories strategic services  which include primarily private line including special access which we market to business customers who require dedicated equipment to transmit large amounts of data between sites  broadband  hosting including cloud hosting and managed hosting  colocation  multi protocol line switching mpls which is a data networking technology that can deliver the quality of service required to support real time voice and video  video including directv  voice over internet protocol voip and verizon wireless services  legacy services  which include primarily local  long distance  switched access  public access  integrated services digital network  isdn which uses regular telephone lines to support voice  video and data applications  and traditional wide area network wan services which allows a local communications network to link to networks in remote locations  
table of contents data integration  which is telecommunications equipment we sell that is located on customers premises and related professional services  such as network management  installation and maintenance of data equipment and building of proprietary fiber optic broadband networks for our government and business customers  and other revenues  which consists primarily of usf revenue and surcharges 
we have revised our presentation of our products and services revenues to conform to our current categories for due to system limitations  we have deemed it impracticable to report our revenue by our previous products and services  which were as follows voice  which included our local calling service to residential  business and wholesale customers within our local service areas  generally for a fixed monthly charge  data  which included revenues primarily from monthly recurring charges for providing broadband access services  data transmission services over special circuits and private lines and switched digital television services  network access  which included revenues primarily from providing wholesale services to various carriers and customers in connection with the use of our facilities to originate and terminate their interstate and intrastate voice transmissions as well as universal support funds and reciprocal compensation from clecs and wireless service providers  and other revenues  which included revenues from providing i fiber transport  clec and security monitoring services  ii leasing  selling  installing and maintaining customer premise equipment and wiring  iii providing payphone services  iv participating in the publication of local directories  v providing network database services and vi providing video services  as well as other new product and service offerings 
the following table summarizes our operating revenues under our current revenue categorization years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions strategic services legacy services data integration other total operating revenues 
table of contents for comparability purposes  we have included the former revenue categorization for and years ended december  increase decrease centurylink embarq total dollars in millions voice data network access other total operating revenues our operating revenues increased substantially in as compared to due to our acquisitions of savvis and qwest 
due to our acquisition of embarq on july   our operating revenues reflect a full year of embarq s results  as opposed to our operating revenues  which reflect only six months of embarq s results 
total operating revenues increased billion in as compared to and increased billion in as compared to our increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of qwest  which contributed total operating revenues net of intercompany eliminations of billion 
legacy centurylink operating revenues decreased million  or  in and million  or  in as compared to the prior year period 
these decreases were primarily attributable to declines in legacy services revenues  which reflected the continuing loss of access lines in our markets 
at december   we had million access lines  of which million were in legacy qwest s markets 
access lines in our legacy centurylink markets declined to million at december  from million at december   a decrease of  and were million at december   a decrease of 
we believe the decline in the number of access lines was primarily due to the displacement of traditional wireline telephone services by other competitive products and services 
we estimate that our access lines loss will be between and in our legacy services revenues were also negatively impacted in by the continued migration of customers to bundled service offerings at lower effective rates 
the decreases in our legacy services revenues were partially offset by higher revenues from strategic services revenues 
broadband and private line services accounted for a majority of the growth in strategic services revenues 
in  total operating revenues decreased million due to the elimination of all intercompany transactions upon the july  discontinuance of regulatory accounting 
we are aggressively marketing our strategic services including our data hosting services and data integration to offset the continuing declines in our legacy services revenues 
we believe our recent acquisitions of savvis and qwest will strengthen our ability to achieve this goal 
further analysis of our operating revenues by segment is provided below in segment results 
operating expenses as discussed in note basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  during we changed the definitions we use to classify expenses as cost of services and products and selling  general and administrative  and have reclassified prior period amounts to conform to our new definitions 
during  our operating expenses increased substantially in comparison to primarily due to our acquisition of qwest and savvis 
in addition  our operating expenses increased substantially in as compared to due to our acquisition of embarq 

table of contents the following tables summarize our operating expenses years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest savvis total dollars in millions cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses years ended december  increase decrease centurylink embarq total dollars in millions cost of services and products exclusive of depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses the increases in total operating expenses of billion in was largely attributable to the inclusion of billion in post acquisition legacy qwest operating expenses net of intercompany eliminations in our consolidated operating expenses 
in addition  the acquisition of savvis on july  increased our consolidated operating expenses by million 
as discussed in the overview section  our operating expenses for  and included substantial severance and integration costs related to the qwest  savvis and embarq acquisitions as well as significant acquisition accounting adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense see note acquisitions and note goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets 
excluding the effects of legacy qwest and savvis expenses  total operating expenses in increased million  or  due primarily to integration costs associated with the qwest acquisition and increased costs of providing our facilities based video services to more customers 
total operating expenses in excluding billion of incremental costs associated with operating the embarq properties for a full year in as compared to a half year in  decreased million primarily due to a million reduction in operating expenses from the elimination of all intercompany transactions upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a million reduction in salaries and benefits 
cost of services and products for legacy centurylink operations was relatively unchanged in for  higher costs of services and products associated with providing our facilities based video service of million were substantially offset by a million decrease in salaries and benefits and a million decrease in facilities costs associated with the migration of legacy embarq long distance traffic to our internal networks 
costs of services and products in excluding million of incremental costs associated with operating the embarq properties for a full year in as compared to a half year in decreased million primarily due to a reduction in operating expenses from the elimination of all intercompany transactions upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting 

table of contents legacy centurylink selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for as compared to  while selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million for as compared to for all periods presented  our expenses include significant transaction  severance and integration expenses related to the savvis  qwest and embarq acquisitions see table in overview above 
changes in the timing and amount of qwest and savvis integration expenses resulted in net increases in legacy centurylink selling  general and administrative expenses of million in  from the amounts for the comparable periods of this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in in operating taxes  which were primarily due to favorable property tax and transaction tax settlements 
in addition  in we had a decrease of million in compensation expenses  which were primarily due to workforce reductions and lower pension expense 
selling  general and administrative expense in excluding million of incremental costs associated with operating the embarq properties for a full year in as compared to a half year in decreased million primarily due to a million reduction in salaries and benefits  a million decrease in legal costs and a million reduction in expenses from the elimination of all intercompany transactions due to the discontinuance of regulatory accounting 
depreciation and amortization for legacy centurylink increased million  or  in primarily due to higher levels of property  plant and equipment 
depreciation and amortization in excluding million of incremental expense associated with operating the embarq properties for a full year in as compared to a half year in decreased million due to a million decrease resulting from a change in certain depreciation rates effective july  upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting and a million decrease of certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase due to higher levels of plant in service

other income expense interest expense increased million in primarily due to debt assumed in the qwest acquisition and incurred subsequent to that acquisition 
see note long term debt and credit facilities and liquidity and capital resources below for additional information about the debt assumed in the qwest acquisition 
interest expense for legacy centurylink increased million  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to in  the increase was primarily due to interest on our senior notes with billion aggregate principal that were issued in june to finance the savvis acquisition  partially offset by principal repayments made during and the first quarter of in  interest expense increased primarily due to the interest expense attributable to billion of embarq s indebtedness we assumed in mid other income expense reflects certain items not directly related to our core operations  including gains and losses from non operating asset dispositions and impairments  our share of income from our interest in a cellular partnership  interest income and foreign currency gains and losses 
other income expense for legacy centurylink decreased million in  as compared to this change was primarily due to million in transaction expenses incurred in connection with terminating an unused bridge loan financing commitment related to the savvis acquisition see note acquisitions 
the change from to was primarily due to the recognition of a million pre tax charge for certain debt extinguishment transactions consummated in october of which million was incurred by centurylink and million was incurred by embarq 

table of contents income tax expense our income tax expense for the years ended december  and decreased million and increased million  respectively  from the amounts for the comparable year 
our decrease in was primarily due to a decrease in income before income tax expense due primarily to the acquisition of qwest 
our increase was due to increased income before income tax expense due in part to the inclusion of a full year of embarq operations in for the years ended december   and  our effective income tax rate was  and  respectively 
the increase was due in part to the effects of certain nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with our acquisition of qwest  which was substantially offset by the effects of a tax law change in one of the states in which we operate that resulted in recognition of a million tax benefit in the second quarter of in addition  due to executive compensation limitations pursuant to the internal revenue code  a portion of the lump sum distributions related to the termination of an executive retirement plan made in the first quarter of is reflected as non deductible for income tax purposes and thus increased our effective income tax rate 
certain merger related costs incurred during and are also non deductible for income tax purposes and similarly increased our effective income tax rate 
in  such an increase in our effective tax rate was partially offset by a million reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with state net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  in we recognized net after tax benefits of approximately million primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
see note income taxes and income tax expense for additional information 
extraordinary item upon the discontinuance of regulatory accounting on july   we recorded a one time extraordinary gain of approximately million after tax 
see note discontinuance of regulatory accounting for additional information related to this extraordinary gain

due to system limitations we have not reported our segment information using our current segments as we have deemed it impracticable to do so 
as such  the following section only includes data for the years ended december  and see consolidated operating results in the results of operations overview section above for variance discussions related to our financial information 

table of contents the following table reconciles our total segment revenues and total segment income presented above to operating revenues and operating income reported in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  dollars in millions total segment revenues other operating revenues operating revenues reported in our consolidated statements of operations total segment income other operating revenues depreciation and amortization other unassigned operating expenses operating income reported in our consolidated statements of operations in connection with the recent reorganization of our segments  we also revised the way we categorize our segment revenues and segment expenses 
our major categories of products and services are strategic services  legacy services  data integration and other  each of which is described in more detail in operating revenues above 
we report our segment expenses for regional markets  business markets and wholesale markets as follows direct expenses  which primarily are specific  incremental expenses incurred as a direct result of providing services and products to segment customers  along with selling  general and administrative expenses that are directly associated with specific segment customers or activities  and allocated expenses  which are determined by applying activity based costing and other methodologies to include network expenses  facilities expenses and other expenses such as fleet  product management and real estate expenses 
for savvis operations  segment expenses incorporate the entire operations of our savvis subsidiaries  including certain centrally managed costs that are allocated to our other segments and overhead costs that are not allocated to our other operating segments 
the integration of certain of these functions for savvis are still in the early stages 
consequently  all savvis operations segment expenses have been categorized as direct expenses 
we intend to refine our expense methodology and begin allocating expenses to savvis operations as we continue integrating it among our other segments beginning in we do not assign depreciation and amortization expense to our segments  as the related assets and capital expenditures are centrally managed 
other unassigned operating expenses consist primarily of expenses for centrally managed administrative functions such as finance  information technology  legal and human resources  severance expenses and restructuring expenses 
interest expense is also excluded from segment results because we manage our financing on a total company basis and have not allocated assets or debt to specific segments 
in addition  other income expense does not relate to our segment operations and is therefore excluded from our segment results 
we have recast our operating results based on our new segment reporting 

table of contents we may make further changes to our segment reporting as we continue to integrate the operations of legacy qwest and legacy savvis 
for more information on our segment reporting  see note segment information 
regional markets the operations of our regional markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends  including those described below 
the discussion that follows generally applies to both our legacy centurylink markets and our legacy qwest markets for periods after the april  acquisition date 
strategic services 
we continue to focus on increasing subscribers of our broadband services in our regional markets segment 
in order to remain competitive  we believe continually increasing connection speeds is important 
as a result  we continue to invest in our fiber to the node  or fttn  deployment  which allows for the delivery of higher speed broadband services 
while traditional atm based broadband services are declining  they have been more than offset by growth in fiber based broadband services 
we also continue to expand our product offerings including facilities based video services and enhance our marketing efforts as we compete in a maturing market in which most consumers already have broadband services 
we expect these efforts will improve our ability to compete and increase our broadband revenues 
facilities based video expenses 
as we continue to expand our facilities based video services we are incurring start up expenses in advance of the revenue that this service is expected to generate 
although  over time  we expect that our revenue for facilities based video services will offset the expenses incurred  the timing of this revenue growth is uncertain 
access lines 
our voice revenues have been  and we expect they will continue to be  adversely affected by access line losses 
intense competition and product substitution continue to drive our access line losses 
for example  many consumers are substituting cable and wireless voice and electronic mail and social networking services for traditional voice telecommunications services 
we expect that these factors will continue to impact our business 
service bundling and other product promotions  as described below  continue to be some of our responses to offset the loss of revenues as a result of access line losses 
service bundling and product promotions 
we offer our customers the ability to bundle multiple products and services 
these customers can bundle local services with other services such as broadband  video  long distance and wireless 
while our video and wireless services are an important piece of our customer retention strategy  they do not make a large contribution to strategic services revenues 
however  we believe customers value the convenience of  and price discounts associated with  receiving multiple services through a single company 
while bundle price discounts have resulted in lower average revenues for our individual products  we believe service bundles continue to positively impact our customer retention 
in addition to our bundle discounts  we also offer limited time promotions on our broadband service for prospective customers who want our broadband product in their bundle which further aids our ability to attract and retain customers and increase usage of our services 
operating efficiencies 
we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
this involves balancing our workforce in response to our workload requirements  productivity improvements and changes in industry  competitive  technological and regulatory conditions 

table of contents the following table summarizes the operating results from legacy centurylink and legacy qwest for our regional markets segment years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest total dollars in millions segment revenues strategic services legacy services data integration total revenues segment expenses direct allocated total expenses segment income segment margin percentage segment income the acquisition of qwest on april  largely contributed to an increase in our regional markets segment income of billion for the year ended december  as compared to our consolidated segment margin percentage declined in as a result of lower margins in legacy qwest markets 
segment income for our legacy centurylink operations decreased million as compared to reflecting declines in revenues while expenses remained relatively flat 
segment revenues excluding revenues attributable to the qwest acquisition  regional markets revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to growth in strategic services revenues did not fully offset a decline in legacy services revenues 
the higher amounts of strategic services revenues are due principally to volume increases in our facilities based video services and increases in the number of broadband subscribers  partially offset by the effects of rate discounts 
increases in mpls and ethernet services volumes also contributed to higher strategic services revenues 
legacy services revenues decreased primarily due to declines in local services associated with access line losses resulting from competitive pressures 
segment expenses regional markets expenses  exclusive of legacy qwest expenses  decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses and decreased employee related expense due to workforce reductions  partially offset by increased costs to provide facilities based video services 
business markets the operations of our business markets segment have been impacted by several significant trends  including those described below 
the discussion that follows generally applies to both our legacy centurylink markets and our legacy qwest markets for periods after the april  acquisition date 

table of contents strategic services 
our mix of total revenues continues to migrate from legacy services to strategic services as our enterprise and government customers increasingly demand customized and integrated data  internet and voice services 
we offer diverse combinations of emerging technology products and services such as private line  mpls  hosting  and voip services 
we believe these services afford our customers more flexibility in managing their communications needs and enable us to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their operations 
although we are experiencing price compression on our strategic services  we expect overall revenues from these services to grow 
legacy services 
we face intense competition with respect to our legacy services and continue to see customers migrating away from these services and into strategic services 
in addition  our legacy services revenues have been and we expect they will continue to be adversely affected by access line losses 
data integration 
we expect both data integration revenue and the related costs will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as this revenue stream tends to be more sensitive than other revenue streams to changes in the economy and to changes in spending trends of our federal government customers 
operating efficiencies 
we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
this involves balancing our workforce in response to our productivity improvements while achieving operational efficiencies and improving our processes through automation 
we also expect our business markets segment to benefit indirectly from efficiencies in our company wide network operations 
the following table summarizes the operating results from legacy centurylink and legacy qwest for our business markets segment years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest total dollars in millions segment revenues strategic services legacy services data integration total revenues segment expenses direct allocated total expenses segment income segment margin percentage segment income the acquisition of qwest on april  substantially increased the scale of our business markets segment  resulting in an increase in our segment income of million  for the year ended december  as compared to our consolidated segment margin percentage declined in as a result of lower margins in legacy qwest markets 
legacy qwest operations accounted for of our business markets segment revenues and of our segment income 

table of contents segment revenues legacy centurylink business markets revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease primarily reflected lower revenues from legacy services driven by access line losses and lower data integration revenues due to lower sales of data integration equipment 
segment expenses legacy centurylink business markets expenses remained relatively flat for the year ended december  as compared to however  direct expenses increased primarily due to increased employee related expenses resulting from a larger sales force and higher customer premise equipment expenses in  while allocated expenses decreased due to lower network expenses related to cost optimization efforts 
wholesale markets the operations of our wholesale markets segment will likely be impacted by the recently adopted fcc order which will substantially increase the pace of reductions in the amount of switched access revenues we receive  as discussed in the regulation section in item of this report  as well as the significant trends discussed below 
the discussion that follows generally applies to both our legacy centurylink markets and our legacy qwest markets for periods after the april  acquisition date 
private line services including special access 
demand for our private line services continues to increase  despite our customers optimization of their networks  industry consolidation and technological migration 
while we expect that these factors will continue to impact our wholesale markets segment  we ultimately believe the growth in fiber based special access provided to wireless carriers for backhaul will  over time  offset the decline in copper based special access provided to wireless carriers as they migrate to ethernet  and bandwidth consumption grows  although the timing and magnitude of this technological migration is uncertain 
access and local services revenues 
our access and local services revenues have been and we expect will continue to be  adversely affected by regulation  technological migration  industry consolidation and rate reductions 
for example  consumers are substituting cable  wireless and voip services for traditional voice telecommunications services  resulting in continued access revenue loss 
we expect these factors will continue to adversely impact our wholesale markets segment 
long distance services revenues 
wholesale long distance revenues continue to decline as a result of customer migration to more technologically advanced services  price compression  declining demand for traditional voice services and industry consolidation 

table of contents the following table summarizes the operating results from legacy centurylink and legacy qwest for our wholesale markets segment years ended december  increase decrease centurylink qwest total dollars in millions segment revenues strategic services legacy services data integration total revenues segment expenses direct allocated total expenses segment income segment margin percentage segment income the acquisition of qwest on april  largely contributed to an increase in our wholesale markets segment income of billion for the year ended december  as compared to segment income for our legacy centurylink operations decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily reflecting declines in revenues in both periods  as discussed further below 
segment revenues excluding revenues attributable to the qwest acquisition  wholesale markets revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to this decrease reflects substantially lower revenues from legacy services  partially offset by growth in revenues from strategic services 
the decrease in legacy services revenues reflects ongoing declines in access and local services volumes and revenues due to the substitution of cable  wireless and voip services for traditional voice telecommunications services 
growth in strategic services revenues  primarily relating to private line and special access services  partially offset the declines in legacy services revenues 
segment expenses wholesale markets expenses  exclusive of legacy qwest expenses  increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the increase in legacy centurylink wholesale markets expenses was primarily due to increased allocated expenses reflecting increased bad debts expense 
direct expenses decreased for the year as a result of reduced access costs 
savvis operations the operations of our savvis operations segment could be impacted by several significant trends  including those described below 
colocation 
colocation is designed for clients seeking data center space and power for their server and networking equipment needs 
our data centers provide our clients around the world with a secure  high powered  purpose built location for their it equipment 
we anticipate 
table of contents continued pricing pressure for these services as wholesale vendors enter the enterprise colocation market  however  we believe that our data center expansion strategy can help mitigate these pricing challenges 
managed hosting 
managed hosting services provide a fully managed solution for a customer s it infrastructure and network needs  and include dedicated and cloud hosting services  utility and computing storage  consulting and managed security services 
we expect increasing pricing pressure on the managed hosting business from competing cloud computing offerings 
however  we remain focused on growing our managed hosting business  specifically in our cloud service offerings  as we believe this is a key to growth 
we believe that we have continued to strengthen our cloud position in the market by adding differentiating features to our cloud products 
network services 
network services are comprised of our managed network services  including managed vpn  hosting area network and bandwidth services 
segment income for these services has been relatively flat due to pricing pressures on vpn and bandwidth services  offset by increases in network services that support our colocation and managed hosting service offerings 
the following tables summarize the operating results of savvis operations for after their acquisition date of july  years ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions strategic services segment expenses segment income segment margin percentage segment revenues segment revenues for our savvis operations was million  which was derived from colocation services of million  or  managed hosting services of million  or  and network services of million  or 
segment expenses segment expenses attributed to savvis operations was million  which were derived primarily from cost of services and products of million and selling  general and administrative expenses of million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain policies and estimates as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our past or present results of operations related to i business combinations  ii goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets  iii property  plant and equipment  iv pension and post retirement benefits  v loss contingencies and litigation reserves  and vi income taxes 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact  or they have the potential to have a material impact  on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions made when accounting for the items described below are reasonable  based on information available at the time they are made 
however  there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
business combinations we have accounted for our acquisition of qwest on april  and savvis on july  under the acquisition method of accounting  whereby the tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the portion of the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the recognition of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations involves estimates and judgments by our management that may be adjusted during the measurement period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
the fair values recorded are made based on management s best estimates and assumptions 
in arriving at the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  we consider the following generally accepted valuation approaches the cost approach  income approach and market approach 
our estimates may also include assumptions about projected growth rates  cost of capital  effective tax rates  tax amortization periods  technology life cycles  the regulatory and legal environment  and industry and economic trends 
small changes in the underlying assumptions can impact the estimates of fair value by material amounts  which can in turn materially impact our results of operations 
goodwill  customer relationships and other intangible assets we amortize customer relationships primarily over an estimated life of years  using either the sum of the years digits or straight line methods  depending on the type of customer 
our capitalized software  which consists primarily of assets obtained from the qwest acquisition  is primarily being amortized using the straight line method over estimated lives up to seven years 
approximately million of our capitalized software  which represents costs to develop an integrated billing and customer care system  is being amortized over a twenty year period 
tradenames and patents assets predominantly use the sum of the years digits method over an estimated life of four years 
indefinite life intangibles are not amortized  but are reviewed annually for potential impairment 
we periodically review the estimated lives and methods used to amortize our other intangible assets 
the amount of future amortization expense may differ materially from current amounts  depending on the results of our periodic reviews and our final determinations of acquisition date fair value related to savvis and qwest s intangible assets see note acquisitions 
we are subject to testing for impairment of long lived assets including goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets based on applicable accounting guidelines 

table of contents we are required to review goodwill recorded in business combinations for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
we are required to write down the value of goodwill only in periods in which the recorded amount of goodwill exceeds the fair value 
our annual measurement date for testing goodwill impairment is september we have managed our operations based on four operating segments regional markets  business markets  wholesale markets and savvis operations and considered these four operating segments to be the appropriate level for testing goodwill impairment 
we have attributed our goodwill balance to our segments at december  as follows dollars in millions regional markets business markets wholesale markets savvis operations total goodwill with the exception of our savvis segment  our operating segments do not correspond to our legal entity organization structure  which required us to apply significant judgment based on numerous assumptions to attribute our goodwill and certain other assets and liabilities to the operating segments in order to make our annual impairment assessment 
for this assessment  we compare each segment s estimated fair value to the carrying value of the assets that we attribute to the segment 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value  we conclude that no impairment exists 
if the fair value of the segment is less than the carrying value  a second calculation is required in which the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying value of goodwill that we attribute to the segment 
estimating the implied fair value of goodwill requires further assumptions and the application of judgment to assess the current fair values of the assets and liabilities attributable to the segment 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value  goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
small changes in the assumptions underlying either the valuation methods or the attribution methods can drive material changes in the implied fair value of goodwill 
at september   we estimated the fair value of our regional  business and wholesale markets reporting units using an equal weighting based on a market approach and a discounted cash flow method 
the market approach includes the use of comparable multiples of publicly traded companies whose services are comparable to ours to corroborate discounted cash flow results 
the discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of projected cash flows and a terminal value  which represents the expected normalized cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete five year projection period 
the estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate that represents our weighted average cost of capital  which we determined to be as of the measurement date which was comprised of a pre tax cost of debt of and a cost of equity of 
we also reconciled the estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of september  and concluded that the indicated implied control premium of was reasonable based on recent transactions in the market place 
for our savvis operations  we determined the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using various methods  including an overall discounted cash flow analysis performed for all of savvis operations 
as of september   the fair value assignments were preliminary and could change significantly upon finalization of the fair value assignments 
due to the recentness of the acquisition and the related preliminary valuation results and the lack of any significant adverse events that have occurred to savvis operating results or our expectations of forecasted operating results 
table of contents utilized in the preliminary valuation since the july  acquisition date  we concluded that the goodwill related to the savvis operations was not impaired as of september  as of september   based on our analysis performed with respect to these segments as described above  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of that date 
however  as of that date  the estimated fair value of the regional markets and wholesale markets exceeded their carrying value by less than 
a basis point increase in the discount rate used in our analysis would have caused the estimated fair values of the regional markets and wholesale markets goodwill to be less than their carrying values and thus would have required us to perform the second step of goodwill impairment testing 
on october   the fcc adopted the connect america and intercarrier compensation reform order the caf order 
this order will reduce the amount of switched access revenue we recognize in our wholesale markets segment in the future 
although other elements of this order are currently expected to result in positive impacts to our overall business  it will likely have a material negative impact to our wholesale markets segment 
because we expect the order to have a material negative impact on our wholesale markets segment  we conducted another assessment of the goodwill attributed to the wholesale markets segment at december  in the process of re estimating the fair value of the wholesale markets segment as a result of the caf order  we updated our estimates of projected future cash flows and we revised our market multiple assumption 
in our most recent estimate  we revised our revenue projections to stabilize by rather than our previous assumption that revenues would decline in perpetuity  and thus increasing our terminal value 
after updating our fair value estimate of the wholesale markets segment to reflect revised estimates of revenues  the effects of our market multiple assumption due to changes in our stock price between september  and december   the increase in terminal value and the adverse effects of the caf order  the estimated fair value of the wholesale markets segment exceeded its attributed carrying value by greater than 
we also evaluated and concluded that the goodwill attributed to our other reporting units was not impaired as of december  due to i an increase in our market capitalization since september   ii a reduction in our carrying value of equity since september  and iii the lack of significant adverse changes in the operating forecasts of our other segments 
we cannot assure that other adverse conditions will not trigger future goodwill impairment testing or an impairment charge 
a number of factors  many of which we have no ability to control  could affect our financial condition  operating results and business prospects and could cause our actual results to differ from the estimates and assumptions we employed in our goodwill impairment testing 
these factors include  but are not limited to  i further weakening in the overall economy  ii a significant decline in our stock price and resulting market capitalization  iii changes in the discount rate  iv successful efforts by our competitors to gain market share in our markets  v adverse changes as a result of regulatory actions  vi a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the overall business climate  vii recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of our reporting units and viii additional information relative to the impact of the caf order 
we will continue to monitor certain events that impact our operations to determine if an interim assessment of goodwill impairment should be performed prior to the next required testing date of september  property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment acquired in connection with our acquisitions was recorded based on its fair value as of its acquisition date 
substantially all other property  plant and equipment is stated at original cost less depreciation 
renewals and betterments of plant and equipment are capitalized while repairs  as well as renewals of minor items  are charged to operating expense 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment is provided on the straight line method using class or overall group rates  such average annual rates range from to 

table of contents normal retirements of property  plant and equipment are charged against accumulated depreciation  with no gain or loss recognized 
other types of property  plant and equipment is stated at cost and  when sold or retired  a gain or loss is recognized 
we depreciate such property on the straight line method over estimated service lives ranging from two to years 
we perform annual internal reviews to evaluate the reasonableness of depreciable lives for our property  plant and equipment 
our reviews utilize models that take into account actual usage  replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution to estimate the remaining life of our asset base 
the changes in our estimates incorporated as a result of our most recent review did not have a material impact on the level of our depreciation expense 
pension and post retirement benefits we sponsor several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans referred to as our pension plans for substantially all employees 
in addition to these tax qualified pension plans  we also maintain several non qualified pension plans for certain eligible highly compensated employees 
we maintain post retirement benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain eligible retirees 
pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits attributed to eligible employees service during the year  as well as interest on benefit obligations  are accrued currently 
pension and post retirement benefit expenses are recognized over the period in which the employee renders service and becomes eligible to receive benefits as determined using the projected unit credit method 
pension prior service costs and actuarial gains and losses are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees expected to receive benefits 
post retirement healthcare prior service costs are recognized as components of net periodic expense over the average expected years to full benefit eligibility for active employees 
post retirement actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the average expected future working lifetime of active employees 
in computing the pension and post retirement health care and life insurance benefits expenses and obligations  the most significant assumptions we make include discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  health care trend rates and our evaluation of the legal basis for plan amendments 
the plan benefits covered by collective bargaining agreements as negotiated with our employees unions can also significantly impact the amount of expense  benefit obligations and pension assets that we record 
the discount rate is the rate at which we believe we could effectively settle the benefit obligations as of the end of the year 
we selected the discount based on a cash flow matching analysis using hypothetical yield curves developed by an actuary firm from us corporate bonds rated high quality and projections of the future benefit payments that constitute the projected benefit obligation for the plans 
this process establishes the uniform discount rate that produces the same present value of the estimated future benefit payments  as is generated by discounting each year s benefit payments by a spot rate applicable to that year 
the spot rates used in this process are derived from a yield curve created from yields on the th to th percentile of us high quality bonds 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is the long term rate of return we expect to earn on the plans assets 
the rate of return is determined by the strategic allocation of plan assets and the long term risk and return forecast for each asset class 
the forecasts for each asset class are generated primarily from an analysis of the long term expectations of various third party investment management organizations 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is reviewed annually and revised  as necessary  to reflect changes in the financial markets and our investment strategy 
to compute the expected return on pension and post retirement benefit plan assets  we apply an expected rate of return to the fair value of the pension plan assets and to the fair value of the 
table of contents post retirement benefit plan assets adjusted for contribution timing and for projected benefit payments to be made from the plan assets 
annual market volatility for these assets is reflected in the subsequent year s net periodic combined benefits expense 
changes in any of the above factors could impact operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations as well as the value of the liability and accumulated other comprehensive income of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is reflected as a reduction to our pension and post retirement benefit expense 
if our assumed expected rates of return for were basis points lower  our qualified pension and post retirement benefit expenses would have increased by million 
if our assumed discount rates for were basis points lower  our qualified pension and post retirement benefit expenses would have decreased by million and our projected benefit obligation would have increased by approximately billion 
an increase of basis points in the initial healthcare cost trend rate would have increased our post retirement benefit expense by million and increased our projected post retirement benefit obligation by million 
the trusts for the pension and post retirement benefits plans hold investments in equities  fixed income  real estate and other assets such as private equity assets 
the assets held by these trusts are reflected at estimated fair value as of december  for additional information on our trust investments  see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
loss contingencies and litigation reserves we are involved in several material legal proceedings  as described in more detail in legal proceedings in item of this report 
we assess potential losses in relation to these and other pending or threatened tax and legal matters 
for matters not related to income taxes  if a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we recognize an expense for the estimated loss 
to the extent these estimates are more or less than the actual liability resulting from the resolution of these matters  our earnings will be increased or decreased accordingly 
if the differences are material  our consolidated financial statements could be materially impacted 
if a loss is considered reasonably possible  we disclose any determinable estimate of the loss if material but we do not recognize any expense for the potential loss 
income taxes our provision for income taxes includes amounts for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflecting future tax consequences attributable to tax nols  tax credit carryforwards and differences between the financial statement carrying value of assets and liabilities and the tax bases of those assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are computed using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred taxes often involves an exercise of judgment related to the realization of tax basis 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment that tax positions taken and the resulting tax basis  are more likely than not to be sustained if they are audited by taxing authorities 
also  assessing tax rates that we expect to apply and determining the years when the temporary differences are expected to affect taxable income requires judgment about the future apportionment of our income among the states in which we operate 
these and other matters involve the exercise of significant judgment 
any changes in our practices or judgments involved in the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities as described above 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be recovered 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether adjustments to our valuation allowance are appropriate 
in making this evaluation  we rely on our recent history of pre tax earnings  estimated timing of future deductions and benefits represented by the deferred tax assets and our forecasts of future earnings  the latter two of which involve the exercise of significant judgment 
at december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize the majority of our deferred tax assets 
if forecasts of future earnings and the nature and estimated timing of future deductions and benefits change in the future  we may determine that a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets is appropriate  which could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations 
see note income taxes for additional information 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
this update simplifies the goodwill impairment assessment by allowing a company to first review qualitative factors to determine the likelihood of whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the two step goodwill impairment test 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the company would not be required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test for that reporting unit 
this update is effective for interim and annual goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
this asu  which we adopted during the third quarter of  did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this update requires the use of the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in these types of arrangements 
this method requires a vendor to use its best estimate of selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists when evaluating multiple deliverable arrangements 
this standard update was effective for us on january  and we have adopted it prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified after january  this standard update has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements since the allocation of revenue has historically been based upon the relative fair value of the elements as determined by reference to vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when the elements have been sold on a stand alone basis 
liquidity and capital resources overview at december   we held cash and cash equivalents of million and had billion available under our billion revolving credit facility referred to as our credit facility  which is described further below 
excluding cash used for acquisitions  we have generally relied on cash provided by operations and our credit facility to fund our operating and capital expenditures  make our dividend payments and repay a portion of our maturing debt 
our operations have historically provided a stable source of cash flow that has helped us meet the needs of the business 
our acquisition of qwest on april  and  to a lesser extent  savvis on july   resulted in significant changes in our consolidated financial position and our future cash requirements 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million  compared to million at december  
table of contents at december   we had a working capital deficit of million  reflecting current liabilities of billion and current assets of billion  compared to positive working capital of million at december  the unfavorable change in our working capital position is primarily due to our consolidation of qwest s working capital accounts as well as million in current maturities of long term debt at december  we anticipate that our existing cash balances and net cash provided by operating activities  which were significantly enhanced by our acquisition of qwest  will enable us to meet our other current obligations  fund capital expenditures and pay dividends to our shareholders 
we also may draw on our credit facility as a source of liquidity if and when necessary 
we currently expect to continue our current annual dividend of per common share  subject to our board s discretion 
debt and other financing arrangements we have available a four year billion revolving credit facility  which expires in january up to million of the credit facility can be used for letters of credit  which reduces the amount available for other extensions of credit 
available borrowings under the credit facility are also effectively reduced by any outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program 
our commercial paper program borrowings are effectively limited to the lesser of billion or the total amount available under the credit facility 
at december   we had million in borrowings and no amounts of letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility  and no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 
the credit facility has lenders  with commitments ranging from million to million 
under the credit facility  we  and our indirect subsidiary  qwest corporation  qc  must maintain a debt to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in our credit facility ratio of not more than and  respectively  as of the last day of each fiscal quarter for the four quarters then ended 
the credit facility also contains a negative pledge covenant  which generally provides restrictions if we pledge assets or permit liens on our property  and requires that any advances under the credit facility must also be secured equally and ratably 
the credit facility also has a cross payment default provision  and the credit facility and certain of our debt securities also have cross acceleration provisions 
when present  these provisions could have a wider impact on liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument 
to the extent that our ebitda as defined in our credit facility  is reduced by cash settlements or judgments  including in respect of any of the matters discussed in note commitments and contingencies  our debt to ebitda ratios under certain debt agreements will be adversely affected 
this could reduce our financing flexibility due to potential restrictions on incurring additional debt under certain provisions of our debt agreements or  in certain circumstances  could result in a default under certain provisions of such agreements 
at december   our long term debt including current maturities totaled billion  compared to billion outstanding at december  substantially all of the billion increase in our debt is attributable to the acquisition of qwest on april  and our recent debt issuances to fund the acquisition of savvis and the retirement of its credit facility in july approximately million of our centurylink  inc series l notes will mature on august  and on january   we called million of qwest communications international inc notes due february   committing to retire them on march  subject to market conditions  we expect to continue to issue debt securities from time to time in the future to refinance a substantial portion of our maturing debt 
this includes issuing debt securities of centurylink or through our qc subsidiary to refinance its maturing debt 
the availability  interest rate and other terms of any new borrowings will depend on the ratings assigned to us and qc by the three 
table of contents major credit rating agencies  among other factors 
following our announcement in april of our agreement to purchase savvis  one of these agencies revised its previous outlook on its rating of us from stable to negative 
we believe this negative outlook could result in a ratings downgrade if we are unable to reduce our debt leverage ratio  while maintaining free cash flow each as defined by the ratings agency over the to months following the negative outlook announcement 
between the date of this report and the end of  we currently expect to reduce our consolidated debt levels by million to billion  based on current circumstances and market conditions 
in april  we entered into a million uncommitted revolving letter of credit facility 
at december   our outstanding letters of credit totaled million under this facility 
future contractual obligations the following table summarizes our estimated future contractual obligations at december  and thereafter total dollars in millions long term debt  including current maturities and capital lease obligations interest on long term debt and capital leases operating leases purchase commitments post retirement benefit obligation non qualified pension obligations unrecognized tax benefits other total future contractual obligations interest paid in all years may differ due to future refinancing of debt 
interest on our floating rate debt was calculated for all years using the rates effective at december  we have various long term  non cancelable purchase commitments for advertising and promotion services  including advertising and marketing at sports arenas and other venues and events 
we also have service related commitments with various vendors for data processing  technical and software support services 
future payments under certain service contracts will vary depending on our actual usage 
in the table above we estimated payments for these service contracts based on the level of services we expect to receive 
represents the amount of tax and interest we would pay for our unrecognized tax benefits 
of our total balance of unrecognized tax benefits of million and related estimated interest and penalties of million  only million would result in future cash payments if our tax positions were not upheld 
the remaining million is an unrecognized tax benefit in the form of a refund claim that  if not granted  would not result in a cash payment and therefore is not included in the table above 
see note income taxes for additional information 
the timing of any payments for our unrecognized tax benefits cannot be predicted with certainty  therefore  such amount is reflected in the and thereafter column in the above table 
the table does not include our open purchase orders as of december  these purchase orders are generally at fair value  and are generally cancelable without penalty  other long term liabilities  such as accruals for legal matters and other taxes that are not contractual obligations by nature 
we cannot determine with any degree of reliability the years in which these liabilities might ultimately settle  
table of contents cash funding requirements for pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees 
benefits paid by our qualified pension plans are paid through trusts 
cash funding requirements for the trusts are not included in this table as we are not able to reliably estimate required contributions to the trust 
our funding projections are discussed further below  certain post retirement benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees 
not all of our post retirement benefit obligation amount is a contractual obligation and only the portion that we believe is a contractual obligation is reported in the table 
see additional information on our benefits plans in note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  contract termination fees 
these fees are non recurring payments  the timing and payment of which  if any  is uncertain 
in the ordinary course of business and to optimize our cost structure  we enter into contracts with terms greater than one year to use the network facilities of other carriers and to purchase other goods and services 
our contracts to use other carriers network facilities generally have no minimum volume requirements and are based on an interrelationship of volumes and discounted rates 
assuming we exited these contracts in  the contract termination fees would be approximately million 
under the same assumption  termination fees for these contracts to purchase goods and services would be million 
in the normal course of business  we believe the payment of these fees is likely to be remote  and potential indemnification obligations to counterparties in certain agreements entered into in the normal course of business 
the nature and terms of these arrangements vary 
historically  we have not incurred significant costs related to performance under these types of arrangements 
capital expenditures we incur capital expenditures on an ongoing basis in order to enhance and modernize our networks  compete effectively in our markets and expand our service offerings 
we evaluate capital expenditure projects based on a variety of factors  including expected strategic impacts such as forecasted revenue growth or productivity  expense and service impacts and our expected return on investment 
the amount of capital investment is influenced by  among other things  demand for our services and products  cash generated by operating activities and regulatory considerations 
we estimate our total capital expenditures to be approximately billion to billion 
our capital expenditures continue to be focused on our strategic services such as video  broadband and managed hosting services 
in  we anticipate that our fiber investment  which includes fiber to the tower  or fttt  will be similar to that spent in fttt is a type of telecommunications network consisting of fiber optic cables that run from a telecommunication provider s broadband interconnection points to cellular towers 
fttt allows for the delivery of higher bandwidth services supporting mobile technologies than would otherwise generally be available through a more traditional telecommunications network 
pension and post retirement benefit obligations we are subject to material obligations under our existing defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans 
the accounting unfunded status as of december  of our defined pension plans and other post retirement benefit obligations was billion and billion  respectively 
see note employee benefits to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information about our pension and other post retirement benefit arrangements 
benefits paid by our pension plans are paid through a trust 
we contributed million during the year ended december  to our pension plans and expect to make a contribution of less than million in we currently expect that required and voluntary contributions for will be approximately million  based on current laws and circumstances 
the actual amount of contributions to our plans in and beyond will depend on earnings on investments  discount rates  demographic experience  changes in plans benefits and funding laws and regulations 

table of contents certain of our post retirement health care and life insurance benefits plans are unfunded 
several trusts hold assets that are used to help cover the health care costs of certain retirees 
as of december   the fair value of these trust assets was million  however  a portion of these assets is comprised of investments with restricted liquidity 
we estimate that the more liquid assets in the trust will be adequate to provide continuing reimbursements for covered post retirement health care costs for approximately four years 
thereafter  covered benefits will be paid either directly by us or from the trusts as the remaining assets become liquid 
this projected four year period could be substantially shorter or longer depending on returns on plan assets  the timing of maturities of illiquid plan assets and future changes in benefits 
historical information the following table summarizes our consolidated cash flow activities which include cash flows from savvis  qwest and embarq after their respective acquisition dates years ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities years ended december  increase decrease dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities the increase in our net cash provided by operating activities in is largely attributable to the acquisitions of qwest and savvis  which contributed net cash provided by operating activities of approximately billion and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in as compared to increased primarily due to including a full year of operations of embarq as compared to only a half year in our consolidated financial statements in item in this report provide information about the components of net income and differences between net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
for additional information about our operating results  see results of operations above 
net cash used in investing activities included payments for property  plant and equipment and capitalized software of billion in  including billion for qwest and savvis post acquisition capital expenditures  compared to million in in addition  we paid billion  net of million cash received  for the acquisition of savvis on july  cash used in investing activities in was partially offset by cash acquired through the april  acquisition of qwest of million  net of million cash paid 
net cash used in financing activities decreased in primarily due to us receiving net debt proceeds in excess of payments of approximately billion in and a debt payment of million in in addition  our cash dividends paid increased million in as compared to primarily as a result of the issuance of million common shares in connection with our acquisitions of qwest and savvis in net cash used in financing activities in as compared to increased due to a million increase in cash dividends paid  primarily due to the issuance of 
table of contents million shares issued on july  for the acquisition of embarq  partially offset with million in increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity incentive plans 
on october   our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  qwest corporation qc  issued million aggregate principal amount of its notes due in exchange for net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses  of million 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of qc and may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at a redemption price equal to the greater of their principal amount or the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments discounted at a us treasury interest rate specified in the indenture agreement plus basis points 
on september   qc issued million aggregate principal amount of its notes due in exchange for net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses  of million 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of qc and may be redeemed  in whole or in part  on or after september  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
in october  qc used the net proceeds from this offering  together with the million of net proceeds received on october   from the debt issuance described above and available cash  to redeem the billion aggregate principal amount of its notes due and to pay all related fees and expenses  which resulted in an immaterial loss 
on june   we issued unsecured senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of billion senior notes  consisting of i million of senior notes  series p  due  ii million of senior notes  series r  due and iii billion of senior notes  series s  due after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses  we received aggregate net proceeds of billion in exchange for the senior notes 
we may redeem the senior notes  in whole or in part  at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of their principal amount or the present value of the remaining principal and interest payments discounted at a us treasury interest rates plus basis points 
we used the net proceeds to fund a portion of our acquisition of savvis and repay certain of savvis debt see note acquisitions 
in april  we received commitment letters from two banks to provide up to billion in bridge financing for the savvis acquisition 
this arrangement was terminated in june in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  resulting in million in transaction expenses recognized in other income expense  net 
on june   qc issued approximately million aggregate principal amount of its notes due in exchange for net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses  of million 
the notes are unsecured obligations of qc and may be redeemed  in whole or in part  on or after june  at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date 
qc used the net proceeds  together with available cash  to redeem million aggregate principal amount of its notes due and to pay related fees and expenses 
certain matters related to acquisitions qwest s pre existing debt obligations consisted primarily of debt securities issued by qwest and two of its subsidiaries while savvis remaining debt obligations consist primarily of capital leases  all of which are now included in our consolidated debt balances 
the indentures governing qwest s debt securities contain customary covenants that restrict the ability of qwest or its subsidiaries from making certain payments and investments  granting liens and selling or transferring assets 
based on current circumstances  we do not anticipate that these covenants will significantly restrict our ability to manage cash balances or transfer cash between entities within our consolidated group of companies as needed 
in accounting for the qwest acquisition  we recorded qwest s debt securities at their estimated fair values  which totaled billion as of april  our acquisition date fair value estimates were 
table of contents based primarily on quoted market prices in active markets and other observable inputs where quoted market prices were not available 
the fair value of qwest s debt securities exceeded their stated principal balances on the acquisition date by million  which is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt  of which million was recognized in other matters we have cash management arrangements with certain of our principal subsidiaries  in which substantial portions of the subsidiaries cash is regularly transferred to us in exchange for matching receivables 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these receivables are eliminated as intercompany transactions 
although we periodically repay these receivables to fund the subsidiaries cash requirements throughout the year  at any given point in time we may owe a substantial sum to our subsidiaries under these receivables  which is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
we also are involved in various legal proceedings that could have a material effect on our financial position 
see note commitment and contingencies for the current status of such legal proceedings  including matters involving qwest 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our variable rate long term debt obligations 
we seek to maintain a favorable mix of fixed and variable rate debt in an effort to limit interest costs and cash flow volatility resulting from changes in rates 
from time to time over the past several years  we have used derivative instruments to i lock in or swap our exposure to changing or variable interest rates for fixed interest rates or ii to swap obligations to pay fixed interest rates for variable interest rates  however  at december  we had no such instruments outstanding 
we have established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative instrument activities 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
management periodically reviews our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and implements strategies to manage the exposure 
at december   we have approximately billion excluding capital lease and other obligations with a carrying amount of million of long term debt outstanding  of which bears interest at fixed rates and is therefore not exposed to interest rate risk 
we had billion floating rate debt exposed to changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in libor relative to this debt would decrease our annual pre tax earnings by million 
with our acquisition of savvis in july  we have become exposed to the risk of fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which its international operations are denominated  primarily the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the japanese yen and the singapore dollar
