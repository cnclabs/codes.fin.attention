this discussion should be read in conjunction with zaza s financial statements and the notes thereto referred to in this annual report on form k 

table of contents general zaza is an independent exploration and production company focused on the exploration and development of unconventional onshore oil and gas resources in the united states of america and europe 
zaza was formed for the purpose of being a holding company of both toreador resources corporation toreador and zaza energy llc zaza llc  from and after completion of the combination of these two companies  which was completed on february  prior to this combination  zaza had no assets and had not conducted any material activities other than those incident to its formation 
however  upon the consummation of this combination  zaza became the parent company of zaza llc and toreador 
termination of hess edas on june   hess and zaza executed a heads of agreement the hoa to terminate the ongoing obligations of the parties under the edas see business termination of edas and to divide the joint venture assets 
prior to the hoa s effective date of june   two of zaza llc s principal sources of capital were cash bonus income and reimbursable expenses from the hess joint venture 
in the future  zaza s principal sources of capital are expected to be cash flow from operations  cash on hand including the cash payment contemplated under the hoa  potential borrowings under any credit facility it may enter into and  if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties  joint ventures  and sales of debt or equity securities 
cash from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices  which can be extremely volatile 
zaza s cash flow from operations will also depend upon the volume of oil and gas that zaza produces 
unless it otherwise expands reserves  zaza s production volumes and cash flow from operations may decline as reserves are produced 
also  prior to the effective date of the hoa  our portion of exploration and development expenditures in the eagle ford was carried entirely by hess in each of the five prospect areas established under the terms of the hess joint venture 
our exploration and development costs were entirely carried by hess for each well in each prospect area  subject to a cap on the number of carried wells in each prospect area calculated by dividing the total gross leased acreage in such prospect area by for any wells drilled in a given prospect area above such number  zaza had the right but not the obligation to participate in zaza s pro rata share of each well in that particular prospect area 
zaza charged a portion of its g a expenses and other related costs directly to hess pursuant to the terms of the edas 
as a result of the transactions outlined in the hoa  zaza will no longer be able to rely on hess to carry its exploration and development costs 
going concern we have historically relied on funds from our joint venture arrangements with hess to finance our operations  and as a result of disagreements with hess relating to these joint venture arrangements  as of june  we had a working capital deficiency of approximately to million 
hess and zaza have executed the hoa to terminate the ongoing obligations of the parties under the edas  which  will provide zaza with million in readily available funds 
the hoa is non binding and subject to definitive documentation 
in connection with the execution of the hoa  zaza llc and hess entered into an amendment to the exploration and development agreement eagleford shale area dated april   as amended  and the applicable joint operating agreements  to eliminate hess s obligation to carry the cost of wells under those agreements in the cotulla prospect area  in exchange for a cash payment by hess to zaza llc of million 
this million was paid to zaza on june  the combined million will be used in offsetting amounts owed to us under the eda of approximately million  in settlement of third party accounts payable balance of approximately million  reduction of million of the principal amount of our senior secured notes due the senior notes  million in associated fees  the drilling of the first eaglebine well and general corporate purposes 
in order to execute our long term strategy  we will need additional debt or 
table of contents equity financing to continue our business plan if cash flows from operations are insufficient or unavailable 
in connection with obtaining a suitable waiver from the holders of our senior notes for the late submission of the financial statements and going concern opinion  the company has agreed with the lead investors of our senior notes to pay down million of the million principal outstanding and to pay million in associated fees at the closing of the transactions outlined under the hoa 
the uncertainty surrounding the closing of the transaction with hess and our current lack of readily available liquidity provided by other third party sources raise doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern

zaza llc management s discussion analysis the following is a discussion of the financial condition  results of continuing operations  liquidity and capital resources of zaza energy  llc  which we refer to herein as zaza llc 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with zaza llc s financial statements and the notes thereto referred to in this annual report on form k 
general zaza llc is an independent exploration and production company focused on the exploration and development of unconventional onshore oil and gas resources in the united states of america 
zaza began leasing oil and gas properties in its core eagle ford shale areas in south texas in zaza llc first focused its efforts on lease acquisitions under the hess joint venture  leasing approximately  gross acres approximately  net acres by december   and generating lease bonus revenues from this leasing activity under the hess joint venture in of approximately million 
as of december   zaza llc had accumulated eagle ford lease acreage in the hess joint venture of approximately  gross acres approximately  net acres 
on june   hess and zaza executed the hoa see business termination of the edas to terminate the ongoing obligations of the parties under the edas and to divide the assets covered by these agreements 
prior to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the hoa  and subject to definitive documentation  zaza holds a working interest in the hess joint venture properties 
under the terms of the joint venture  hess would have paid all of the acquisition costs  up to a cap of million  and all of the exploration and development costs for a specified number of wells until production 
zaza llc s acreage position also includes approximately  gross acres approximately  net acres in the eagle ford eastern extension  known as the eaglebine 
on march   zaza llc announced that it had entered into a farm in transaction with range to increase its position in the eaglebine to approximately  gross acres  net acres 
these properties were not part of the joint venture with hess 
zaza had drilled wells under the hess joint venture as of december  with eight others in process 
subject to availability of capital  zaza intends to begin drilling its first well in the eaglebine 
table of contents in there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
zaza s results of operations depend upon many factors including the following the sale prices of oil and gas  the level of total sales volumes of oil and gas  the availability of  and zaza llc s ability to raise  additional capital resources  zaza llc s ability to provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
in addition  please see risk factors risks related to the our company in item a for additional information 
commodity prices 
the results of zaza llc s operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for its oil and gas production 
the price zaza llc receives for its production is dependent upon spot market prices and price differentials 
zaza llc does not currently hedge any of its production  but to the extent that zaza llc enters into hedging transactions for any of its production in the future  as we currently expect  zaza will realize gains or losses on those hedges 
while zaza llc may enter into long term sales contracts for oil and gas in the future  to date  all of zaza llc s sales of oil have been made in the spot market  not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts  and no gas has been sold 
accordingly  the price zaza llc receives for its oil and gas production is dependent upon numerous factors beyond its control 
significant declines in prices for oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on zaza llc s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
during the year ended december   the price of oil increased significantly while the average price of gas decreased from the levels experienced during year ended december  during the year ended december   the new york mercantile nymex price for west texas intermediate wti averaged per bbl compared to per bbl for the same period of nymex henry hub spot prices for gas averaged per mmbtu for the year ended december  compared to for the same period of prices closed on december  at per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas 
the realized prices that zaza llc receives for its production differ from nymex futures and spot market prices  principally due to quality and basis differentials which are dependent on actual delivery location  adjustments for btu content  gathering  processing and transportation costs  and the effects of hedging transactions  if any 
during the year ended december   differentials averaged per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas as compared to per bbl of oil and per mcf of gas during the year ended december  increases in the differential between the benchmark prices for oil and gas and the wellhead price zaza llc receives have in the past and could in the future significantly reduce its revenues and cash flow from operations 
exploration and development activity 
on june   hess and zaza executed the hoa to terminate the ongoing obligations of the parties under the edas and to divide the assets covered by the agreements  which  subject to definitive documentation  will result in zaza s asset base growing to approximately  gross acres in the eagle ford  supplementing its existing approximately  gross acres  net acres in the eaglebine 
we believe that zaza llc s high quality pro forma asset base  high degree of operational control and inventory of drilling projects position it well for future growth 
zaza llc s properties are concentrated in locations that facilitate substantial 
table of contents economies of scale in drilling and production operations and more efficient reservoir management practices 
zaza llc s success is highly dependent upon its future oil and gas production  which in turn is highly dependent upon its ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from zaza llc s oil and gas properties and its proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced unless zaza llc acquires additional properties containing proved reserves  conducts successful development and exploration activities or  through engineering studies  identifies additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that zaza llc s exploration and development activities will result in increases in zaza s proved reserves 
if zaza llc s proved reserves decline in the future  its production may also decline and  consequently  its cash flow from operations  and the amount that it is able to borrow under available credit facilities  will also decline 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
zaza llc may be unable to acquire additional reserves or develop its undeveloped reserves  in which case zaza llc s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected

for the year ended december   operating activities provided million of cash  reflecting net changes in operating assets and liabilities also due to an increase in accounts receivable  primarily from hess 
zaza llc s cash flows from operating activities for the period ended december  includes a net decrease of million in advances from hess related to exploration and development activities 

table of contents net cash used in investing activities in was approximately million and in increased to approximately million  which included million of cash used for the acquisition of acreage in the eaglebine area  million in uncarried capital expenditures in the cotulla area  and approximately million for furniture and fixtures as operations were established 
there we no cash inflows or outflows related to investing activities in financing activities in were million  consisting of million of proceeds from short term borrowings offset by million of member distributions  while financing activities in were million  primarily consisting of borrowings from members and member equity contributions 
financing activities in were  consisting of  proceeds from short term borrowing and  in member contributions 
since zaza llc was formed in march  zaza llc s primary sources of capital have been cash generated from cash bonuses and reimbursable expenses paid by hess  cash generated by operations  and short term loans from zaza llc s founding members 
the balance of the short term loans provided by zaza llc s founding members was million at december  the amounts were paid by zaza llc prior to closing of the combination 
the oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
zaza llc s capital requirements are driven principally by its obligations to fund the following the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  acquisition of interests in additional oil and gas properties  and the development of production and transportation facilities 
zaza llc s primary cash requirements are for capital expenditures  working capital  operating expenses  and acquisitions 
the amount of capital expenditures that zaza llc is able to make has a direct impact on its ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect its ability to service any debt obligations it may incur and to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  zaza llc must conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we believe zaza llc s numerous drilling opportunities will allow it to increase production volumes  however  its drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil and gas reservoirs will be found 
in the future  if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  zaza llc may sell producing properties  which could further reduce zaza llc s production volumes 
historically  zaza llc primarily funded its operations and capital expenditures through cash bonus income from the hess joint venture 
zaza entered into the hess joint venture in april the hess joint venture has funded the acquisition of approximately  gross acres for approximately million 
through december   zaza llc recorded cash bonus income of million for acquiring acreage on behalf of the hess joint venture 
the bonus income was recognized as revenue after all leases are obtained  title was cured and transferred to hess  and recorded with the appropriate county 
zaza llc is currently seeking a potential joint venture partner 
in the event that zaza llc is not able to select a suitable partner  zaza llc expects to finance a portion of its eaglebine program with cash flow from operations 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund this program  zaza llc would be required to seek additional financing to maintain and expand this program 

table of contents the table below sets forth the components of the capital expenditures for the period from march  inception to december   for the years ended december  and for the period from march  inception to december  for the year ended december  for the for the year ended december  expenditure category exploration development acquisition facilities total represents primarily undeveloped leasehold acreage 
capital expenditures for the period from march  inception to december  and for the year ended december  were  and million  respectively  and capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million 
during and  capital expenditures were primarily related to the acquisition of acreage in the eaglebine 
zaza llc recorded no exploration or development expenditures for through in the eagle ford because all of zaza llc s capital expenditures were carried by hess pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement 
during the year ended december   capital expenditures were million  primarily related to extending and renewing leases on zaza s existing properties in the eaglebine 
zaza llc s capital budget for includes approximately million for maintaining our acreage positions 
on march   zaza llc entered into a transaction with range texas production  llc range  a subsidiary of range resources corporation  to expand zaza s position in the eaglebine to a total holding of approximately  gross acres  net acres 
under the terms of the transaction  zaza llc will obtain a working interest in the acquired acreage  is the designated operator  has committed to drilling one well and has committed to making two cash payments 
the amount of additional capital expenditures for the is subject to zaza llc having adequate cash flow from operations  accessing capital markets  and operating and commodity price performance 
if zaza llc does not have access to adequate capital  zaza llc may be required to reduce its capital budget and or cancel projects entirely 
zaza llc s ability to make all of its budgeted capital expenditures will also be subject to the availability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and services 
zaza llc s capital expenditures could also include expenditures for the acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of oil and gas decline  and if zaza llc s costs of operations increase or if its production volumes decrease  zaza llc s cash flows will decrease  which may result in a reduction of its capital expenditures budget 
if zaza llc decreases its capital expenditures budget  it may not be able to offset oil and gas production decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties  if any 
on september   zaza llc drew down on the full amount of a million revolving line of credit that was recently provided by texas champion bank 
the line of credit bears interest at  matures on september   and is secured by a first lien on zaza llc s interests in certain of its oil and gas properties 
the line of credit will not be used to finance working capital purposes 
the line of credit was repaid in full at the closing of the combination 
contractual obligations zaza llc is committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements operating leases  
table of contents long term debt to the extent such long term debt is incurred  and interest on long term debt to the extent such long term debt is incurred 
zaza llc has no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and has not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that zaza llc is obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due in twelve month periods ending december  contractual obligations total thereafter notes payable interest on notes payable operating leases total represents zaza  llc member notes payable and the revolving line of credit with texas champion bank 
these amounts were both paid off at the closing of the combination 
zaza llc maintains a reserve for costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
at december   zaza llc s reserve for these obligations totaled  but was not subject to contractual commitments 
as part of the range transaction  effective as of march   zaza has committed to making two undisclosed cash payments and drilling one well estimated to cost between million depending on whether a current wellbore may be used in the second quarter of off balance sheet arrangements 
at december   zaza llc had no existing off balance sheet arrangements as defined under sec regulations that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on zaza llc s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contingencies 
from time to time  zaza llc may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of zaza llc s operations in the normal course of business 
at december   zaza llc was not engaged in any legal proceedings that were expected  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on zaza llc 
related party transactions 
for the year ended december   zaza llc received revenue totaling  from neuhaus brooks investment  llc  which is owned by a member of zaza llc  as oil and gas production revenue 
no such revenue was received in zaza llc also entered into million notes payable with its founding members in conjunction with the merger 
these notes bear interest per annum 
these notes were paid off at closing of the combination 
effective may   zaza llc and its members entered into a compensation agreement in which base salary  discretionary bonus and incentive compensation were defined 
incentive compensation is based on the fulfillment of certain performance metrics and a company liquidity event  defined therein as an initial public offering  merger  reverse merger  financing or other availability of capital deemed financially beneficial to zaza llc 
as of december  and  zaza llc had an outstanding commitment to its members in the amount of million and million  respectively  related to performance metrics achieved 
at the closing of the combination  the compensation amounts were paid down and replaced with subordinated notes having an aggregate principal amount of million

in march  zaza llc entered into an agreement with the zaza llc members and eli smith associates  which we refer to as smith  to acquire working interests in any unproved acreage identified in a defined area of mutual interest located in the colorado and lavaca counties of texas 
during the year ended december   zaza llc acquired acreage totaling approximately million pursuant to this agreement 
during the year ended december   zaza llc acquired acreage totaling approximately million pursuant to this agreement  million of the purchase price was in the form of million notes payable due to the zaza llc members and million in accounts payable due to zaza llc members  which was paid in january the zaza llc managing partners and smith retain a direct or indirect reserved overriding royalty interest generally equal to three percent in each property sold to zaza llc  which is divided pro rata among the four sellers in the transactions 
simultaneously with each purchase  zaza llc pursuant to a separate agreement sells of the acquired working interests to hess  retaining a working interest in each property 
no gain or loss was recognized on the sales to hess

zaza llc had a million revolving line of credit with texas champion bank under which the full amount was drawn on december  the line of credit bears interest at  matures on september   and is secured by a first lien on zaza llc s interests in certain of its oil and gas properties 
the loan was paid off at the closing of the combination 
zaza llc has no full time employees  but has entered into a management agreement the management agreement with sequent petroleum management  llc spm pursuant to which spm provides zaza llc with contractors and consultants and their related benefits programs in exchange for a monthly fee for managing such personnel 
one of the principals of spm  scott gaille  was appointed our chief compliance officer  effective march zaza llc reimburses spm for the costs of the personnel under the management agreement  including for the costs of their insurance and other benefits

in addition  at december   zaza llc had a payable to lg for  related to the reminder of a short term working capital loan that bears no interest 
we cancelled our arrangement with lg in the second quarter of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition and imbalances 
oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and if collectability of the revenue is probable 
the amount of oil or gas sold may differ from the amount to which zaza llc is entitled based on its working interest or net revenue interest in the properties 
revenue is recorded when title is transferred based on zaza llc s nominations and net revenue interests 
pipeline imbalances occur when production delivered into the pipeline varies from the gas zaza llc nominated for sale 
pipeline imbalances are settled with cash approximately thirty days from date of production and are recorded as a reduction of revenue or increase of revenue depending upon whether zaza llc is over delivered or under delivered 
settlements of oil and gas sales occur after the month in which the product was produced 
zaza llc estimates and accrues for the value of these sales using information available at the time financial statements are generated 
differences are reflected in the accounting period during which payments are received from the purchaser 
zaza llc also derives revenue from a bonus paid by hess on leasehold amounts that zaza llc leases on behalf of the hess joint venture 
the bonus amount is equal to of the sum of all direct costs associated with acquiring the net mineral acres as defined in the hess joint venture agreement and is recognized as revenue after the leases are obtained  title is cured and transferred to hess  and recorded with the appropriate county 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
zaza llc accounts for its gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserves quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of oil and gas  are capitalized 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term for such properties and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
zaza llc s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of oil and condensate  natural gas liquids and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainly  to be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving producing history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserves base used to calculate depreciation  
table of contents depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets  including gathering and processing facilities  are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets are grouped in accordance with the extractive industries oil and gas topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect i the addition of capital costs  ii reserves revisions upwards or downwards and additions  iii property acquisitions and or property dispositions and iv impairments 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  zaza llc compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on zaza llc s estimate of future gas and oil prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
reserves estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward recoverable in future years from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain 
proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
proved undeveloped reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
proved undeveloped reserves on undrilled acreage are limited i to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances and ii to other undrilled locations if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 

table of contents probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
when deterministic methods are used  it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves 
when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain  even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion 
probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir 
probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves 
possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves 
when deterministic methods are used  the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves 
when probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates 
possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain 
frequently  this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project 
possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves 
we emphasize that the volume of reserves are estimates that  by their nature are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using geological and reservoir data  as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional performance data 
these reserve revisions result primarily from improved or a decline in performance from a variety of sources such as an addition to or a reduction in recoveries below or above previously established lowest known hydrocarbon levels  improved or a decline in drainage from natural drive mechanisms  and the realization of improved or declined drainage areas 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to decline  the rate at which we record depletion expense would increase 
impairment of oil properties 
we review our proved oil properties for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events and circumstances indicate a potential decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
we estimate the expected future cash flows from our proved oil properties and compare these future cash flows to the carrying value of the oil properties to determine if the carrying value is recoverable 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying value of the oil properties to its fair value in the current period 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of reserves  future commodity prices  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
unproved properties are reviewed quarterly to determine if there has been impairment of the carrying value  with any such impairment charged to expense in the period 
given the complexities associated with oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil market  events may arise that will require us to record an impairment of our oil properties and there can be no assurance that such impairments will not be required in the future nor that they will not be material 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs to be incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production equipment  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land 
we 
table of contents develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the ultimate settlement amount  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the political  legal  environmental and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on an annual basis 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of fasb asc asset retirement and environmental obligations 
asc requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
likewise  if these estimates were revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
toreador resources corporation executive overview toreador is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration and production of crude oil with interests in developed and undeveloped oil properties in the paris basin  france 
toreador is currently focused on the development of our conventional fields and the exploration of the numerous oil plays within its paris basin acreage position 
toreador operates solely in the paris basin  which covers approximately  km of northeastern france  centered to km east and south of paris 
at december  toreador held interests in approximately  gross exploration acres awarded and pending publication 
according to gaffney  cline associates ltd  an independent petroleum and geological engineering firm  or gaffney cline  as of december   toreador s proved reserves were mmbbls  its proved plus probable reserves were mmbbls and its proved plus probable plus possible reserves were mmbbls 
toreador s production for averaged approximately bbl d from two conventional oilfield areas in the paris basin the neocomian complex and charmottes fields 
as of december   production from these oil fields represented a majority of toreador s total revenue and substantially all of its sales and other operating revenue 
we intend to maintain production from these mature assets using suitable enhanced oil recovery techniques 
the following does not include any pro forma adjustments for the hoa 
recent developments concessions renewal the decrees relating to the renewal of the ch teaurenard concession and of the saint firmin des bois concession  which together account for of toreador s existing reserves  received final french government approvals on february   and were published in the official journal journal officiel de la r publique fran aise on february  the renewals extend the expiration date of both concessions to january  
table of contents financial summary for the twelve months ended december  revenue and other operating income from continuing operations were million 
operating costs from continuing operations were million 
loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was million 
net loss available to common shares was million 
production was mboe 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
a current ratio current assets current liabilities of to a debt to equity ratio of to following the repurchase of  aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior notes on october  and the redemption of the remaining  principal amount outstanding of the convertible senior notes on november   as of december   toreador s long term debt consisted solely of the convertible senior notes in an aggregate principal nominal amount of  recorded at a fair value of  on february   in connection with the combination  toreador used part of the proceeds from the sale of the secured notes and warrants to repurchase  in aggregate principal amount of its convertible senior notes at face value plus accrued interest 
this represented all of its outstanding long term debt 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of toreador s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires toreador to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
toreador s significant accounting policies are described in note significant accounting policies to its consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we have identified below policies that are of particular importance to the portrayal of toreador s financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates on a periodic basis and base our estimates on experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements successful efforts method of accounting toreador accounts for its oil and natural gas exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and natural gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and natural gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but such costs are charged to 
table of contents expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
in most cases  a gain or loss is recognized for sales of producing properties 
as of december   toreador had million of costs associated with exploratory costs that had been capitalized for a period of one year or less 
as of december   toreador had million of costs associated with exploratory costs that have been capitalized for a period of greater than one year 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires management s judgment to determine the proper designation of wells as either developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze  and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and application of industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and natural gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
on occasion  wells are drilled which have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and in such instances an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
delineation seismic costs incurred to select development locations within a productive oil and natural gas field are typically treated as development costs and capitalized  but often these seismic programs extend beyond the proved reserve areas and therefore management must estimate the portion of seismic costs to expense as exploratory 
the evaluation of oil and natural gas leasehold acquisition costs requires management s judgment to estimate the fair value of exploratory costs related to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we enter a new exploratory area in hopes of finding oil and natural gas reserves 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and the associated costs will be expensed as dry hole costs 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred

given the complexities associated with oil reserves estimate and the history of price volatility in the oil market  events may arise that will require us to record an impairment of our 
table of contents oil properties and there can be no assurance that such impairments will not be required in the future nor that they will not be material 
toreador recorded no impairment for continuing operations in the twelve months ended december    future development and abandonment costs future development costs include costs to be incurred to obtain access to proved reserves  including drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production equipment  gathering systems  wells and related structures and restoration costs of land 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of toreador s properties based upon the type of production structure  depth of water  reservoir characteristics  depth of the reservoir  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology  the ultimate settlement amount  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement and changes in the political  legal  environmental and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future abandonment costs on an annual basis 
the accounting for future abandonment costs changed on january   with the adoption of fasb asc asset retirement and environmental obligations 
asc requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount  a gain or loss is recognized 
in  two separate incidents occurred offshore turkey in the black sea  which resulted in the sinking of the fallen structures and the loss of three natural gas wells 
toreador has not been requested  or ordered by any governmental or regulatory body  to remove the fallen structures 
therefore  we believe it is unlikely that toreador will receive such a request or order  and no liability has been recorded 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
likewise  if these estimates were revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  we generally provide taxes at the rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdiction 
because our present intention is to reinvest the unremitted earnings in our foreign operations  we do not provide us income taxes on unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries 
management periodically assesses the need to utilize these unremitted earnings to finance our foreign operations 
this assessment is based on cash flow projections that are the result of estimates of future production  commodity prices and expenditures by tax jurisdiction for our operations 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the cash flow projections are subject to revision in the future 
management also periodically assesses  by tax jurisdiction  the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings estimates 
such estimates are inherently imprecise since many assumptions utilized in the assessments are subject to revision in the future 

table of contents derivatives toreador periodically utilizes derivatives instruments such as futures and swaps for purposes of hedging our exposure to fluctuations in the price of crude oil sales 
in accordance with fasb asc  derivatives and hedging  we have elected not to designate the derivative financial instruments to which toreador is a party as hedges  and accordingly  we record such contracts at fair value as an asset or a liability and recognize changes in such fair value in current earnings as they occur 
we determine the fair value of futures and swap contracts based on the difference between their fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date 
the realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives are recorded as a derivative fair value gain or loss in the income statement 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for france is the euro 
translation gains and losses resulting from transactions in euros are included in other comprehensive income for the current period 
we periodically review the operations of our entities to ensure the functional currency of each entity is the currency of the primary economic environment in which toreador operates

the final reporting rule adopts revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and is effective for annual reports on forms k for years ending on or after december  the revisions are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
the amendments are also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
revised requirements in the final reporting rule include  but are not limited to oil and gas reserves must be reported using the un weighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within a month period  rather than year end prices  companies will be allowed to report  on an optional basis  probable and possible reserves  non traditional reserves  such as oil and gas extracted from coal and shales  will be included in the definition of oil and gas producing activities  companies will be permitted to use new technologies to determine proved reserves  as long as those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions with respect to reserve volumes  companies will be required to disclose  in narrative form  additional details on their proved undeveloped reserves puds  including the total quantity of puds at year end  and any material changes to puds that occurred during the year  investments and progress made to convert puds to developed oil and gas reserves and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of puds in individual fields or countries have remained undeveloped for five years or more after disclosure as puds  and companies will be required to report the qualifications and measures taken to assure the independence and objectivity of any business entity or employee primarily responsible for preparing or auditing reserves estimate 

table of contents we have adopted the disclosure requirements beginning with the year ended december  on july   the fasb issued asu  disclosure about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses asu 
asu amends existing disclosure guidance to require entities to provide extensive new disclosures in their financial statements about their financing receivables  including credit risk exposures and the allowance for credit losses 
asu is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard had no impact on our disclosure requirements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts asu 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
this eliminates an entity s ability to assert that a reporting unit is not required to perform step because the carrying amount of the reporting unit is zero or negative despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate the goodwill is more likely than not impaired 
asu is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations asu 
asu specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
asu is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   toreador adopted changes issued by the fasb to revenue recognition for multiple deliverable arrangements asu multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf issue  asc 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements  as toreador does not currently have any such arrangements with its customers 
on january   toreador adopted changes issued by the fasb to the classification of certain employee share based payment awards asu effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades eitf issue j  asc 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
on january   toreador adopted changes issued by the fasb to the testing of goodwill for impairment asu when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts eitf issue a  asc 
these changes require an entity to perform all steps in the test for a reporting unit whose carrying value is zero or negative if it is more likely than not more than that a goodwill impairment exists based on qualitative factors 
this will result in the elimination of an entity s ability to assert that such a reporting unit s goodwill is not impaired and additional testing is not necessary despite the existence of qualitative factors that indicate otherwise 
as toreador s reporting unit carrying value is not zero or negative  the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   toreador adopted changes issued by the fasb to the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations asu disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations eitf issue g  asc 
the adoption of these changes had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu will require companies to present the 
table of contents components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the standard does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  because this asu impacts presentation only  we do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic  this accounting update allows entities to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not defined having a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december  toreador is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this guidance in its consolidated financial statements  however  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources this section should be read in conjunction with note long term debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this filing 
liquidity toreador s liquidity depends on cash flow from operations and existing cash resources 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  a current ratio of approximately to and a debt to equity ratio of to for the twelve months ended december   toreador had an operating loss of million 
toreador had sales and operating revenue of million 
toreador had no other capital expenditures apart from technical studies of la garenne for  toreador does not currently have a credit facility and intends to rely on its cash balance to meet its immediate cash requirements 
toreador s cash flow from operations is highly dependent upon the prices received from our oil production  which are dependent on numerous factors beyond our control 
accordingly  significant changes to oil prices are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operation  cash flows and revenue 
oil prices have been very volatile over the fiscal year of  and we expect  will continue to be  volatile in the fiscal year in order to reduce our exposure to crude oil price fluctuations  on november   we have entered into a collar contract for approximately  bbl per month for the months of january through december for which the floor price is per bbl  and the ceiling price is per bbl

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and  potentially  interest rates as described below 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
all of our market risk sensitive agreements were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the pricing it receives for its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing price for oil and the spot market prices applicable to natural gas production 
pricing for oil and gas has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and this volatility is expected to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for its oil and gas production depend on many factors outside of its control  such as the strength of the global economy 

table of contents to reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices on its revenues  or to protect the economics of property acquisitions  we in the future may periodically enter into derivative contracts with respect to a portion of its projected oil and gas production through various transactions that fix or  through options  modify the future prices realized 
these transactions may include price swaps whereby we would receive a fixed price for its production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty 
additionally  we may enter into collars  whereby it would receive the excess  if any  of the fixed floor over the floating rate or pay the excess  if any  of the floating rate over the fixed ceiling price 
in addition  we may in the future enter into option transactions  such as puts or put spreads  as a way to manage its exposure to fluctuating prices 
such hedging activities are intended to manage exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
derivative financial instruments at times toreador utilizes commodity derivative instruments as part of our risk management program 
these transactions are generally structured as either swaps or collar contracts 
a swap has the effect of an outright sale at a specific price 
a collar has the effect of creating a sale only if a floor or ceiling price is exceeded 
these instruments i reduce the effect of the price fluctuations of the commodities we produce and sell and ii support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans 
when toreador had its senior credit facilities that required these instruments  these instruments protected the amounts required for servicing outstanding debt and maximized the funds available under these facilities 
the trading party that represents the other side of each of these transactions is known as a counterparty 
during  toreador had the following derivative in place type period barrels floor ceiling collar january  december   see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies followed relative to derivative financial instruments and for specific information regarding the terms of our derivative financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in crude oil commodity prices 
interest rate risk 
zaza and zaza llc historically have not had any long term debt  but we have incurred long term debt under our senior notes 
we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts on a portion of its then outstanding debt to mitigate the risk of fluctuating interest rates counterparty and customer credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of its oil and gas receivables with only a few significant customers 
please read business  industry properties marketing and customers for further detail about our significant customers 
our inability  or the failure of its significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation  may materially adversely affect our financial results 
in addition  any oil and gas derivative contracts that we may enter into in the future may expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties 
the risks inherent in our market sensitive instruments are the potential loss arising from adverse changes in oil prices and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analysis however  neither considers the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor does it consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about financial instruments from which we may incur future earnings gains or losses from changes in commodity prices 
we do not designate our derivatives as hedges  however  we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes

while our oil sales are calculated on a us dollar basis  we are exposed to the risk that the values of our french assets will decrease and that the amounts of our french liabilities will increase
