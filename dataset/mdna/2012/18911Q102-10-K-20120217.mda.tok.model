item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this item is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements in item  the section entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors 
overview we are one of the largest producers of coal in the us and in the powder river basin prb  based on coal sales 
we operate some of the safest mines in the coal industry 
according to mine safety and health administration msha data  in  we had one of the lowest employee all injury incident rates among the largest us coal producing companies 
we operate solely in the prb  the lowest cost region of the major coal producing regions in the us  and operate two of the four largest coal mines in the us our operations include three wholly owned surface coal mines  two of which  the antelope mine and the cordero rojo mine  are in wyoming and one of which  the spring creek mine  is in montana 
we also own a non operating interest in a fourth surface coal mine in montana  the decker mine 
we produce sub bituminous thermal coal with low sulfur content and sell our coal primarily to domestic and foreign electric utilities 
initial public offering  related ipo structuring transactions  and secondary offering prior to the initial public offering ipo and the related structuring transactions  cloud peak energy resources llc cpe resources was a wholly owned subsidiary of rio tinto energy america rtea  which is our predecessor for financial reporting purposes 
on november   cloud peak energy inc cpe inc 
acquired from rtea of the common membership units in cpe resources in exchange for a promissory note which was repaid with proceeds from the ipo  and became the sole managing member of cpe resources 
on december   cpe inc priced the secondary offering 
in connection with the secondary offering  we exchanged shares of common stock for the remaining common membership units of cpe resources held by rio tinto  resulting in a divestiture of of rio tinto s holdings in cpe resources making it a wholly owned subsidiary of cpe inc for periods between november  and december   rio tinto s ownership interest in cpe resources was reported as a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated financial statements of cpe inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item discontinued operations in march  cpe resources entered into an agreement to sell its ownership interest in the jacobs ranch mine  a coal mine in wyoming  to arch coal  inc this transaction closed on october  and the proceeds from this sale were distributed to rio tinto america rta 
the results of operations of the jacobs ranch mine are presented as discontinued operations in our historical consolidated financial statements 
consequently  the discussion of our results of operations below focuses on continuing operations as reported in our historical consolidated financial statements 
any forward looking statements exclude the discontinued operations 
decker mine we hold a non operating interest in the decker mine in montana through a joint venture agreement 
under the terms of our joint venture agreement  the other mine owner manages the day to day operations of the decker mine 
we account for our pro rata share of assets and liabilities in our undivided interest in the joint venture using the proportionate consolidation method  whereby our share of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses are included in the appropriate classification in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents core business operations as of december   we controlled approximately billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves 
during the second quarter of  we were the successful bidder on certain mining rights in the west antelope ii north waii north and west antelope ii south waii south coal tracts in the prb 
the tracts have favorable geologic conditions  have increased our year end proven and probable reserves by approximately million tons  and are contiguous with our antelope mine 
with the acquisition of the federal coal leases  we also gained access to approximately million tons of coal in an adjacent state of wyoming coal lease that we controlled but were not previously included in our coal reserve estimates  resulting in a combined total increase of million tons 
our key business drivers include the following the volume of coal sold domestically and internationally  the price for which we sell our coal  the costs of mining  including labor  repairs and maintenance  fuel  explosives  depreciation of capital equipment  and depletion of coal leases  the costs for logistic services and rail and port charges for coal sales on a delivered basis  and capital expenditures to acquire property  plant and equipment 
the volume of coal that we sell in any given year is driven by the amount of global and domestic demand for coal generated electric power 
demand for coal generated electric power may be affected by many factors including weather patterns  natural gas prices  coal fired generating capacity and utilization  environmental and legal challenges  political and regulatory factors  energy policies  international and domestic economic conditions  and other factors discussed in this item and in item a risk factors 
the price at which we sell our coal is a function of the demand relative to the supply for coal  domestically and internationally 
as a region s demand increases  prices are also subject to increase 
significant increases in demand can allow our coal to compete in new markets 
we typically enter into multi year contracts with our customers which helps mitigate the risks associated with any short term imbalance in supply and demand 
in addition  international demand has increased  enabling us to increase exports of coal during the past few years 
during  we entered into derivative financial instruments that are scheduled to settle in and to hedge a portion of our export coal sales 
we typically seek to enter each year with expected production effectively fully sold 
this strategy helps us deliver our expected tonnages and run our mines at predictable production rates  which helps us control operating costs 
in line with the worldwide mining industry  we have experienced increased operating costs for mining equipment  diesel fuel and supplies  and employee wages and salaries 
changes in the cost of commodities related to our production process  such as diesel fuel  will result in changes in the cost of coal production 
we have not entered into any hedging or other arrangements to reduce the volatility in the price of commodities used in our mining operations  although we may do so in the future 
as is common in the prb  coal seams at our existing mines naturally deepen  resulting in additional overburden to be removed at additional cost 
for some of our coal sales  including our sales to asian customers  we arrange and pay for logistic services  rail and or port charges 
our costs for transportation are affected by volume and negotiated freight rates 

table of contents we incur significant capital expenditures to update or expand our mining equipment  surface land holdings and coal reserves 
in line with the worldwide mining industry  generally the cost of capital equipment and lead times are increasing 
in addition  should the costs of acquiring future federal coal leases and associated surface rights increase  our depletion costs would also increase 
on august   the us environmental protection agency epa published in the federal register the cross state air pollution rule csapr which replaces the clean air interstate rule cair 
csapr was expected to take effect on january  and was intended to reduce pollutants from upwind states by requiring states to reduce power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxide nox 
on december   the nox court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit put the implementation of csapr on hold and ordered the epa to continue enforcing cair until the merits of the rule can be judicially reviewed 
power plants options for reducing emissions of these pollutants include switching to a lower sulfur coal or installing emission control technologies  or a combination of both 
since the prb has the lowest sulfur content of any of the large us coal producing regions  any increase in demand for lower sulfur coal could lead to higher demand for coal from the prb particularly for ultra low sulfur coal such as that produced by our antelope mine 
however  for regulated states to meet their requirements under the csapr  a number of coal fired electric generating units will likely need to be retired  rather than be retrofitted with the necessary emission control technologies  thereby reducing demand for thermal coal 
given the current stay of csapr implementation  we are unable to predict the overall impact of this legislation

results of operations owned and operated mines refers to our three surface coal mines and excludes our non operating interest in the decker mine 
we include our share of results from operations at the decker mine along with broker coal sales and billings for transportation and delivery services as other operations 

table of contents revenues the following table presents revenues in millions except per ton amounts year ended december  change amount percent owned and operated mines revenue realized price per ton sold tons sold other operations revenue the increase in revenue from our owned and operated mines was the result of an increase in the realized price per ton of coal sold and an increase in coal sold in compared to  reflecting the strong demand for our coal and the ability of our operations to overcome the rail transportation disruptions which were the result of the severe flooding experienced throughout the midwestern united states during the spring and summer of revenues from other operations increased primarily as a result of a higher volume of coal sold on a delivered basis  including export sales with delivered pricing terms that included logistic services and rail and port charges 
we arranged and paid for the logistic services and rail and port charges and charged our customers for providing this service 
cost of product sold the following table presents cost of product sold in millions except per ton amounts year ended december  change amount percent owned and operated mines cost of product sold average cost per ton sold other operations cost of product sold the increase in the average cost per ton of coal sold is primarily the result of increases in costs related to the price of diesel fuel and lubricants as well as maintenance and repairs 
cost of product sold from other operations increased primarily due to increases in volumes and freight rates on our coal sold on a delivered basis  including asian export sales 
operating income the following table presents operating income in millions year ended december  change amount percent operating income in addition to those factors previously discussed  we realized reductions in selling  general and administrative costs primarily due to lower incentive compensation and the elimination of amounts paid 
table of contents to rio tinto under the transition services agreement  which concluded during depreciation and depletion expense decreased million due to the successful federal coal lease awards during which increased our antelope mine s life by approximately years 
this reduced the discounted value of the future liability of the asset retirement obligation aro and the resulting non cash credit reduced depreciation and depletion expense as the change exceeded the carrying amount of the related asset retirement cost 
other expense the following table presents other expense in millions year ended december  change amount percent other expense other expense was reduced by a million increase in the amount of interest expense capitalized partially offset by million of additional imputed interest during the year ended december  the increase in capitalized and imputed interest was the result of additional interest on the waii north and waii south coal tracts  which were acquired in the second quarter of in addition  we recognized million in marked to market adjustments on our derivative financial instruments in income tax provision the following table presents income tax provision in millions year ended december  change amount percent income expense cpe inc effective tax rate cpe inc income tax expense benefit cpe resources effective tax rate cpe resources change from prior period is not a relevant percentage

the difference from that rate for the year ended december   is due primarily to changes in our valuation allowance resulting from the third quarter annual calculation of our estimate of future taxable income 
cpe resources cpe resources s statutory income tax rate  including state income taxes  is 
the difference from that rate for the year ended december  is due primarily to changes in our valuation allowance resulting from the third quarter annual calculation of our estimate of future taxable income 
the effective tax rate for was also impacted by cpe resources s change in status from an entity generally not subject to income taxes prior to the secondary offering to an entity that must now recognize taxes on a stand alone  separate return basis

results of operations owned and operated mines refers to our three surface coal mines and excludes our non operating interest in the decker mine 
we include our share of results from operations at the decker mine along with broker coal sales and billings for transportation and delivery services as other operations 
revenues the following table presents revenues in millions except per ton amounts year ended december  change amount percent owned and operated mines revenue realized price per ton sold tons sold other operations revenue the increase in revenue from our owned and operated mines reflected an increase in the realized price per ton of coal sold in compared to  reflecting the strong demand for prb coal due to prevailing economic and industry conditions at the time we entered into the related coal supply contracts  and an increase in coal shipped in compared to our share of revenues from coal produced at the decker mine decreased reflecting a decline in shipments partially offset by a higher average price per ton 
broker coal sales decreased following the expiration in the first quarter of of a significant contract 
revenues from transportation and delivery services increased  as a result of a higher volume of coal sold on a delivered basis  including export sales with delivered pricing terms that include logistic services and rail and port charges  where we arranged and paid for the freight costs and charged our customers for providing this service 

table of contents cost of product sold the following table presents cost of product sold in millions except per ton amounts year ended december  change amount percent owned and operated mines cost of product sold average cost per ton sold other operations cost of product sold the increase in the average cost per ton of coal sold is primarily the result of a per ton increase in royalties and production taxes  which reflects the higher average sales prices realized on our coal shipments as well as updates to estimates for non income based taxes 
excluding royalties and production taxes  the cost per ton of coal sold increased from to 
the increase in the cost per ton of coal sold is primarily the result of increases in costs related to the price of diesel fuel and lubricants and a higher strip ratio in compared to as our mines move into deeper mining areas 
the cost of coal sold by the decker mine decreased million in  reflecting lower production volumes partially offset by higher unit production costs 
in addition  the cost of purchased coal decreased million  primarily as a result of decreases of million related to a significant broker sales contract that expired in and million for other broker sales of purchased coal 
the decreases in coal purchased related to our significant broker sales contract and other broker transactions are consistent with the related decreases in broker sales revenues in these decreases are partially offset by an increase in international exports in  which resulted in an increase in freight and handling costs 
operating income the following table presents operating income in millions year ended december  change amount percent operating income operating income was affected by a decrease in amortization expense of million  which is attributable to the expiration of the significant broker contract in the first quarter of  as well as a decrease in selling  general  and administrative costs primarily due to costs incurred in associated with the ipo that were not incurred in  offset by the increased costs to operate as a stand alone public entity and execute the secondary offering 

table of contents other expense the following table presents other expense in millions year ended december  change amount percent other expense change from prior period is not a relevant percentage total other expense increased due to an increase in interest expense on our million of senior notes  which were outstanding for the full year in compared to approximately one month in additionally  during the three months ended september   we completed our annual update of our most recent operating plans and the resulting projected estimated future taxable income 
this resulted in an increase in the estimated liability due to rio tinto under the tax receivable agreement  resulting in a million charge to non operating income

the adjustment to the effective tax rate for the post secondary offering period in to account for pretax income attributable to the controlling interest increased our effective tax rate by approximately 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item cpe resources the effective income tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily attributable to the change in tax status of cpe resources 
for most of through the date of the ipo  our income tax provision was calculated on a stand alone  separate return basis while for most of through the date of the secondary offering  we were organized as a limited liability company and generally were not subject to income taxes 
income taxes are only applicable to the post secondary offering period in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
table of contents discontinued operations the following table presents discontinued operations in millions year ended december  change amount percent discontinued operations change from prior period is not a relevant percentage the change in discontinued operations was primarily attributable to the related transactions being completed in the prior year  with no impact to income attributable to noncontrolling interest the following table presents income attributable to noncontrolling interest in millions noncontrolling interest january  through november  noncontrolling interest november  through december  december  income attributable to noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest january  through december  noncontrolling interest december  through december  december  income attributable to noncontrolling interest income attributable to noncontrolling interest of million for the year ended december  represents rio tinto s interest in cpe resources s net income for the period from january  through december  the portion of net income that is attributable to the noncontrolling interest is not equal to of consolidated equity or of consolidated net income due to the effects of income taxes and related agreements that pertain solely to cpe inc as well as the timing of the secondary offering 
specifically  the million expense related to the change in the tax agreement liability and related adjustments of million to the net value of deferred tax assets are not attributable to the noncontrolling interest 
there was no noncontrolling interest prior to the ipo on november  or after the secondary offering on december  liquidity and capital resources december  in millions cash and cash equivalents investments in marketable securities total in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  our primary sources of liquidity are cash from our operations  investments in marketable securities and borrowing capacity under cpe resources s million revolving credit facility 
cash from operations depends on a number of factors beyond our control  such as the market price for our coal  the quantity of coal required by our customers  coal fired electricity demand  regulatory changes and energy policies impacting our business  our costs of operating including the market price we pay for diesel fuel and other input costs  as well as costs of 
table of contents logistics including rail and port charges  and other risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in item a risk factors 
investments in marketable securities include highly liquid securities which are generally investment grade or better securities and are held as trading securities by cpe resources 
our investment policy has the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss and is intended to limit our credit exposure to any single issuer 
individual securities have various maturity dates  however  it is our expectation that we could sell any individual security in the secondary market allowing for improved liquidity 
on june   cpe resources entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the amended credit agreement with morgan stanley senior funding  inc  as administrative agent  and a syndicate of lenders 
the amended credit agreement establishes a commitment to provide us with a million senior secured revolving credit facility  which can be used to borrow funds or issue letters of credit 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  we may elect to increase the size of the revolving credit facility and or request the addition of one or more new tranches of term loans in a combined amount of up to million 
the credit facility matures on june  the amended credit agreement imposes limitations on the ability of cpe resources and its subsidiaries to make distributions and or extend loans to cpe inc the indenture governing the senior notes also imposes limitations on the ability of cpe resources and its subsidiaries to make distributions  and to extend loans and advances  to cpe inc such limitations  taken as a whole  are less restrictive than those contained in the amended credit agreement 
the limitations in both the amended credit agreement and the indenture have not had  nor are they expected to have  a negative impact upon our ability to fund cash obligations 
the borrowing capacity under the amended credit agreement is reduced by the amount of letters of credit issued 
as of december   our borrowing capacity under the amended credit agreement was million 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility is subject to the terms and conditions of the facility  including our compliance with financial and non financial covenants 
we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our primary uses of cash for the next twelve months  which include our costs of coal production  coal lease installment payments for existing and new lbas and other coal tracts  capital expenditures  interest on our debt  and payments to rio tinto under our tax receivable agreement 
during the three months ended june   we were the successful bidder on certain mining rights in the waii north and waii south coal tracts 
accordingly  we made payments of million and million  respectively  representing the first of five annual installment payments for each bid award amount 
the remaining payments are due annually on the anniversary of the effective dates of the corresponding coal leases  and we expect to make payments of million in related to committed coal leases 
we will continue to explore opportunities to increase our reserve base by acquiring additional coal and surface rights 
if we are successful in future bids for coal rights  our cash flows could be significantly impacted as we would be required to make associated payments 
our anticipated capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest and federal lease payments  which we expect will be between million and million in  include our estimates of expenditures necessary to keep our current fleets updated to maintain our mining productivity and competitive position and the addition of new equipment as necessary 
cpe resources is required to make semi annual interest payments on its senior notes  which commenced on june  in connection with the ipo  cpe inc entered into a tax receivable 
table of contents agreement with rio tinto and recognized a liability for the undiscounted amounts that cpe inc estimated will be paid to rio tinto under this agreement 
the amounts to be paid will be determined based on a calculation of future income tax savings that cpe inc actually realizes as a result of the tax basis increase that resulted from the ipo and secondary offering transactions 
generally  cpe inc retains of the realized tax savings generated from the tax basis step up and rio tinto is entitled to the remaining which is remitted to rio tinto on an annual basis 
based on our estimates as of december   we expect to make payments of million in  payments averaging approximately million each year during to and additional payments in subsequent years 
if we do not have sufficient resources from ongoing operations to satisfy our obligations or the timing of payments on our obligations does not coincide with cash inflows from operations  we may need to use our cash on hand and marketable securities or borrow under our line of credit 
if the obligation is in excess of these amounts  we may need to seek additional borrowing sources or take other actions 
depending upon existing circumstances at the time  we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  our existing debt instruments contain restrictive covenants  which may prohibit us from borrowing under our revolving credit facility or pursuing certain alternatives to obtain additional funding 
overview of cash transactions we started with million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
after making interest and coal lease payments  capital expenditures and generating cash from our operating activities  we ended the year with unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million 
we started with million of restricted cash 
during the year ended december   we were able to negotiate lower collateral requirements with almost all of our surety bond providers thereby releasing million in funds 
we ended the year with million of restricted cash

table of contents cpe resources year ended december  in millions beginning balance cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net cash provided by discontinued operations ending balance cash and cash equivalents beginning balance marketable securities ending balance marketable securities included in net cash used in investing activities is the purchase of marketable securities which are highly liquid securities that are generally investment grade or better and are held as trading securities 
individual securities have various maturity dates  however  it is our expectation that we could sell any individual security in the secondary market allowing for improved liquidity 
the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to was due to a decrease in working capital changes  primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable and payments on the tax agreement liability partially offset by an increase in net income as adjusted for noncash items 
the increase in accounts receivable was driven largely by higher revenues in december as compared to december the decrease in cash provided by operating activities from to was due to a decrease in net income and a decrease in changes in working capital which was primarily caused by a reduction in the receivable from related parties as a result of changes in our relationship with rio tinto through the ipo structuring transactions 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from to was primarily related to our surety bond obligations 
net restricted cash deposits of million occurred in the year ended december  compared to restricted cash releases of million in the year ended december  following a negotiated reduction of collateral required 
this decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by increased purchases of property  plant and equipment  initial payments on federal coal lease obligations  and investments made in marketable securities 
purchases during the year ended december  for property  plant and equipment included payments for haul trucks received in  payments for surface land associated with federal and privately held mineral rights  and cash interest capitalized 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities from continuing operations from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in cash advances to affiliates as a result of the cessation of the cash management program we were under with rio tinto prior to the ipo structuring transactions and a million decrease in the cash paid for property  plant and equipment  including capitalized interest 
purchases during the year ended december  for property  plant  and equipment included the acquisition of the lease by modification at the spring creek mine and the purchase of approximately million tons of privately held coal 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in restricted cash to collateralize surety bond obligations 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities from to primarily was due to distributions to rio tinto totaling million made in compared to none in partially offset 
table of contents by a small increase in the principal portion of payments on federal coal leases and the payment of debt issuance costs of million in the current year related to our amended credit agreement 
cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during was comprised of approximately billion in distributions to rio tinto offset by approximately billion in net proceeds from the senior notes offering and the ipo  all of which occurred in in addition to these amounts paid in  the decrease in cash used in financing activities from to was due to lower principal payments on federal coal leases during and the million payment for debt issuance costs during senior notes we refer to the million senior notes due december  the notes and the million senior notes due december  the notes collectively as the senior notes 
the notes and notes bear interest at fixed annual rates of and  respectively 
there is no mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments for the senior notes and interest payments are due semi annually on june and december  beginning on june  subject to certain limitations  we may redeem the notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to december   or by paying their principal amount thereafter 
similarly  we may redeem the notes by paying specified redemption prices in excess of their principal amount prior to december   or by paying their principal amount thereafter 
in connection with the ipo structuring transactions  we distributed million of the net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes to rtea during the fourth quarter of the remaining net proceeds from the senior notes offering were designated for general corporate purposes 
the senior notes are jointly and severally guaranteed by all of our existing and future restricted subsidiaries that guarantee our debt under our credit facility 
see senior secured revolving credit facility below 
substantially all of our consolidated subsidiaries  excluding decker coal company  are considered to be restricted subsidiaries and guarantee the senior notes 
the indenture governing the senior notes  among other things  limits our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity  pay dividends or distributions  repurchase equity or repay subordinated indebtedness  make investments or certain other restricted payments  create liens  sell assets  enter into agreements that restrict dividends  distributions or other payments from restricted subsidiaries  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of their assets and the assets of their restricted subsidiaries on a combined basis 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a change in control as defined in the indenture  holders of our notes could require us to repurchase all outstanding notes at of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of repurchase 
senior secured revolving credit facility on june   cpe resources entered into the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement establishes a commitment to provide us with a million senior secured revolving credit facility  which can be used to borrow funds or issue letters of credit 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  we may elect to increase the size of the revolving credit facility and or request the addition of one or more new tranches of term loans in a combined amount of up to million 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of cpe resources s assets and substantially all of the assets of certain of cpe resources s subsidiaries  subject to certain permitted liens and customary exceptions for similar coal financings 
our obligations under the credit facility are also supported by a guarantee by cpe resources s domestic restricted subsidiaries 
the credit facility 
table of contents matures on june  as of december   letters of credit totaling million and no cash borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the letters of credit are used as collateral to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item the amended credit agreement replaced our previous million revolving credit facility agreement dated november  there were no borrowings outstanding under the previous credit facility at the time of replacement or at december  at the time of refinancing  we recorded a charge of million to write off certain deferred financing costs as certain banks of the syndicate changed and recorded million of new deferred financing costs 
the aggregate deferred financing costs are being amortized on a straight line basis to interest expense over the five year term of the amended credit agreement 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin of between and  depending on cpe resources s leverage ratio 
we will pay the lenders a commitment fee between and per year  depending on cpe resources s leverage ratio  on the unused amount of the credit facility 
letters of credit issued under the credit facility  unless drawn upon  will incur a per annum fee from the date at which they are issued between and at december  depending on cpe resources s leverage ratio 
letters of credit that are drawn upon are converted to loans 
in addition  in connection with the issuance of a letter of credit  we are required to pay the issuing bank a fronting fee of per annum 
the amended credit agreement contains financial covenants based on ebitda which is defined in the amended credit agreement  and is not the same as ebitda or adjusted ebitda otherwise presented requiring us to maintain defined minimum levels of interest coverage and providing for a limitation on our leverage ratio 
specifically  the amended credit agreement requires us to maintain a a ratio of ebitda to consolidated net cash interest expense equal to or greater than i to through june  and ii to from july  to maturity  and b a ratio of funded debt to ebitda equal to or less than i to through june  and ii to from july  to maturity 
our federal coal lease obligations are not considered debt under our covenant calculations 
the amended credit agreement also requires us to comply with non financial covenants that restrict certain corporate activities 
these covenants include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and pay dividends  among other restrictive covenants 
the amended credit agreement also contains customary events of default with customary grace periods and thresholds 
our ability to access the available funds under the credit facility may be prohibited in the event that we do not comply with the covenant requirements or if we default on our obligations under the amended credit agreement 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants contained in our amended credit agreement 
under the amended credit agreement  the subsidiaries of cpe inc are permitted to make distributions to cpe inc 
to enable it to pay federal  state and local income and certain other taxes it incurs that are attributable to the business and operations of its subsidiaries and to enable cpe inc to pay amounts it owes to rio tinto under the tax receivable agreement 
in addition  as long as no default under the amended credit agreement exists  the subsidiaries of cpe inc also may make annual distributions to cpe inc to fund dividends or repurchases of cpe inc s stock and additional distributions in accordance with certain distribution limits in the amended credit agreement 
finally  the subsidiaries of cpe inc may make loans to cpe inc subject to certain limitations in the amended credit agreement 

table of contents federal coal lease obligations our federal coal lease obligations consist of amounts payable to the blm under leases  each of which require five equal annual payments 
the remaining aggregate annual payments under our existing federal coal leases were as follows as of december  in millions north maysdorf cordero rojo mine south maysdorf cordero rojo mine waii north antelope mine waii south antelope mine total we recognize imputed interest on federal coal leases based on an estimate of the credit adjusted  risk free rates reflecting our estimated credit rating at the inception of the lease 
the carrying value reported on our balance sheet of our federal coal lease obligations was million as of december  additional amounts may be incurred should we bid and win additional coal leases in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are party to a number of arrangements that secure our performance under certain legal obligations 
these arrangements include letters of credit and surety bonds 
we use these arrangements primarily to comply with federal and state laws that require us to secure the performance of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure or reclamation costs  coal lease obligations  state workers compensation  and federal black lung liabilities 
these arrangements are typically renewable annually 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we used surety bonds and letters of credit to secure outstanding obligations as follows in millions surety bonds letters of credit total reclamation obligations lease obligations other obligations total off balance sheet obligations collateralized by restricted cash reclamation obligations include amounts to secure performance related to our outstanding obligations to reclaim areas disturbed by our mining activities and are a requirement under our state mining permits 
the million of restricted cash collateralizes our share of surety bonds that secure decker s reclamation obligations 
lease obligations include amounts generally required as a condition to state or federal coal leases  the amounts vary and are mandated by the governing agency 
other obligations include amounts required for exploration permits  water well construction and monitoring  exporting  and other miscellaneous items as mandated by applicable governing agencies 

table of contents we are required to collateralize some of our surety bonds with cash or letters of credit 
we can substitute collateral at our discretion 
our outstanding surety bonds in respect of our reclamation  lease and other obligations were million at december  including our obligations with respect to the decker mine and are required by law 
state statutes regulate and determine the calculation of the amounts of the bonds that we are required to hold 
we do not believe that these state mandated estimates are a true reflection of what our actual reclamation costs will be 
reclamation bond amounts represent an estimate of the near term reclamation liability that assumes reclamation activities will be performed by a third party during the next one to five years 
because this evaluation is near term  it is recalculated on a frequent basis  often annually 
the basis for calculating bond requirements is substantially different than the requirements that apply to the determination of our aro liability on our consolidated balance sheet  which is determined in accordance with us gaap 
the state calculates our specific bond requirements considering assumed costs that the state would incur if they were required to complete the reclamation on our behalf 
additionally  where a multi year bond  such as a three to five year bond  is put into place  the state regulatory authority requires that the reclamation liability be calculated for the highest cost scenario over that period 
the carrying amount of our reclamation obligations  as determined in accordance with us gaap  which are reported in our consolidated financial statements as aro liabilities  was million at december   million of which is classified as a current liability 
we estimate our aro liabilities based on disturbed acreage to date and the estimated cost of a third party to perform the work 
the estimated aro liabilities are also based on engineering studies and our engineering expertise related to the reclamation requirements 
we also assume that reclamation will be completed after the end of the mine life based on our current reclamation area profiles  which may be a different land disturbance assumption than the state requires  as we generally perform reclamation concurrently with our mining activities 
finally  the carrying amount of our aro liabilities reflects discounting of estimated reclamation costs using credit adjusted  risk free rates 
for a discussion of the risks relating to our reclamation obligations  see item a risk factors risks related to our business and industry if the assumptions underlying our reclamation and mine closure obligations are materially inaccurate  our costs could be significantly greater than anticipated 
because we are required by state and federal law to have these bonds or letters of credit in place before mining can commence  or continue  our failure to maintain surety bonds  letters of credit  or other guarantees or security arrangements would materially adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms  the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety and restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of any credit facility then in place

as discussed in critical accounting policies and estimates asset retirement obligations below  the current and noncurrent carrying amount of our aros involves a number of estimates  including the amount and timing of the payments to satisfy these obligations 
the timing of payments is based on numerous factors  including projected mine closing dates 
based on our assumptions  the carrying amount of our aros excluding concurrent reclamation and amounts due in the current period as determined in accordance with us gaap is million as of december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this table does not include our contractual obligations related to an agreement we entered into in april to purchase land adjacent to our antelope mine  whereby the seller may require us to pay a purchase price of up to million  which will close between april and april this table does not include payments that we expect to make under the tax receivable agreement 
we have recognized a million liability for our estimated payments to rtea under the tax receivable agreement  of which million and million is classified as current and noncurrent  respectively  as of december  the estimated liability is based on forecasts of future taxable income over the anticipated life of our mining operations and reclamation activities  
table of contents assuming no additional coal reserves are acquired 
the assumptions used in our forecasts are subject to substantial uncertainty about our future business operations and the actual payments that we are required to make under the tax receivable agreement could differ materially from our estimates 
based on our estimates as of december   we expect to make payments of million in  payments averaging approximately million each year during to and additional payments in subsequent years 
see item a risk factors other risks related to our corporate structure and common stock we are required to pay rtea for most of the tax benefits we may claim as a result of the tax basis step up we received in connection with the ipo  related ipo structuring transactions and secondary offering 
in certain cases  payments to rtea may be accelerated or exceed our actual cash tax savings 
these provisions may deter a change in control of our company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our judgments  estimates  and assumptions on historical information and other known factors that we deem relevant 
estimates are inherently subjective  as significant management judgment is required regarding the assumptions utilized to calculate accounting estimates in our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on variability in factors affecting these consolidated financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item this section describes those accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from a sale when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is determinable  the product has been delivered  title has transferred to the customer and collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
some coal supply agreements provide for price adjustments based on variations in quality characteristics of the coal shipped 
in certain cases  a customer s analysis of the coal quality is binding and the results of the analysis are received on a delayed basis 
in these cases  we estimate the amount of the quality adjustment and adjust the estimate to actual when the information is provided by the customer 
historically  such adjustments have not been material 
asset retirement obligations our aros arise from the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra and similar state statutes 
these regulations require that we  upon closure of a mine  restore the mine property in accordance with an approved reclamation plan issued in conjunction with our mining permit 
our aros are recorded initially using estimates of future third party costs 
to determine our aros  we calculate on a mine by mine basis the present value of estimated future reclamation cash flows based upon each mine s permit requirements  estimates of the current disturbed acreage subject to reclamation  which is based upon approved mining plans  estimates of future reclamation costs  and assumptions regarding the mine s productivity  which are based on engineering estimates that include estimates of volumes of earth and topsoil to be moved  the purchase and use of particular pieces of large mining equipment to move the earth  and the operating costs for those pieces of equipment 
these cash flow estimates are discounted at credit adjusted  risk free rates to arrive at a present value of estimated future reclamation costs 
upon initial recognition of the liability  a corresponding amount is capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long lived asset 

table of contents the amount recorded as an aro for a mine may change as a result of mining permit changes granted by mining regulators  changes in the timing of mining activities and the mine s productivity from original estimates and changes in the estimated costs or the timing of reclamation activities 
we periodically update estimates of cash expenditures to meet each mine s reclamation requirements and we adjust the aro in accordance with us gaap  which generally requires a measurement of the present value of any change in estimated reclamation costs using credit adjusted  risk free rates 
if a reduction of the asset retirement obligation exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset retirement cost  the adjustment is recorded as a reduction of depletion expense 
annually  we analyze aros on a mine by mine basis and  if necessary  adjust the balance to take into account any changes in estimates 
in addition  on an interim basis  we may update the liability based on significant changes to the life of mine 
federal coal leases upon the award date of federal coal leases pursuant to which payments are required to be paid in equal annual installments  we recognize an asset for the related mineral rights in property  plant  and equipment and a corresponding liability for our future payment obligations in liabilities 
the amount recognized as an asset is the sum of the initial installment due at the effective date of the lease and the amount recognized in liabilities  which reflects the present value of the remaining installments 
we determine the present value of the remaining installments using an estimate of the credit adjusted  risk free rates that reflects our credit rating 
interest is recognized over the term of the lease based on the imputed interest rate that was used to determine the initial liabilities amount on the effective date 
such interest may be capitalized while activities are in progress to prepare the acquired coal reserves for mining 
the mineral rights asset recorded at the effective date is eventually recognized in depreciation and depletion expense using the units of production method over the period the related coal reserves are mined 
income taxes and tax agreement liability periodically  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance to reflect our updated estimate of the tax benefits that are more likely than not to be realized 
our evaluation is based on our consideration of cpe resources s historical operations  the effects of the structuring and financing transactions completed in connection with the ipo and secondary offering  updated forecasts of taxable income over the remaining lives of our mines  the availability of tax planning strategies and other factors 
if future taxable income differs from our estimates or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  adjustments to the valuation allowance may be needed 
we have recognized a tax agreement liability reflecting our estimate of the undiscounted amounts that we expect to pay to rtea under this agreement 
periodically  we adjust the liability based on an updated estimate of the amounts that we expect to pay  using assumptions consistent with those used in our concurrent estimate of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
these periodic adjustments to the tax agreement liability are reflected in our consolidated pretax income  and may also result in corresponding adjustments to our income tax expense and deferred income tax accounts 
increases in our estimates of future taxable income through  for example  acquisitions of additional coal leases increase the likelihood of our future profitability  and therefore  are likely to increase our tax agreement liability and related deferred tax asset in the future 
although our periodic adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and tax agreement liability are based on consistent assumptions  the calculations required to determine these estimates differ in certain respects and the related adjustments will not have offsetting or proportionate effects on our earnings 
in addition  our estimates reflect assumptions about future events that are inherently uncertain 
accordingly  our 
table of contents periodic adjustments to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the tax agreement liability may have material and unpredictable effects on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business has historically experienced only limited variability in results due to the effect of seasons 
demand for coal fired power can increase due to unusually hot or cold weather  as power consumers use more air conditioning or heating 
conversely  mild weather can result in softer demand for our coal 
adverse weather conditions  such as blizzards or floods  can impact our ability to mine and ship our coal  and our customers ability to take delivery of coal 
global climate change enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the us or some of its states or by other countries  or other actions to limit such emissions  could result in electricity generators switching from coal to other fuel sources 
additionally  the creation and issuance of subsidies designed to encourage use of alternative energy sources could decrease the demand of coal as an energy source 
the potential financial impact on us of future laws  regulations  or subsidies will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source as a result of the laws  regulations or subsidies 
that  in turn  will depend on a number of factors  including the appeal and design of the subsidies being offered  the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations such as mandating use by utilities of renewable fuel sources  the time periods over which those laws or regulations would be phased in and the state of commercial development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies 
in view of the significant uncertainty surrounding each of these factors  it is not possible for us to reasonably predict the impact that any such laws or regulations may have on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we define market risk as the risk of economic loss as a consequence of the adverse movement of market rates and prices 
we believe our principal market risks are commodity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk market risk includes the potential for changes in the market value of our coal portfolio 
due to the lack of quoted market prices and the long term nature of our forward sales position  we have not quantified the market risk related to our coal supply agreements 
historically  we have principally managed the commodity price risk for our coal contract portfolio through the use of long term coal supply agreements of varying terms and durations 
as of december   we had contracted to sell approximately million tons during  of which million tons are under fixed price contracts 
a change to the average coal sales price per ton for these million unpriced tons would result in an approximate million change to the coal sales revenue 
in addition  during  we entered into certain derivative financial instruments to help manage our exposure to variability in future 
table of contents international coal prices 
as of december   these derivative financial instruments consisted of contracts for approximately  and  tons which will settle in and  respectively 
we also face price risk involving other commodities used in our production process  primarily diesel fuel 
based on our projections of our usage of diesel fuel for the next months  and assuming that the average cost of diesel fuel increases by  we would incur additional fuel costs of approximately million over the next twelve months 
historically  we have not hedged commodities such as diesel fuel 
we may enter into hedging arrangements with respect to these commodities in the future 
interest rate risk our amended credit agreement is subject to an adjustable interest rate 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources senior secured revolving credit facility 
we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility as of december  if we borrow funds under the revolving credit facility  we may be subject to increased sensitivity to interest rate movements 
any future debt arrangements that we enter into may also have adjustable interest rates that may increase our sensitivity to interest rate movements 
credit risk we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by our counterparties  which may include end use customers  trading houses  brokers  and financial institutions that serve as counterparties to our derivative financial instruments and hold our investments 
we attempt to manage this exposure by entering into agreements with counterparties that meet our credit standards and that are expected to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit and requiring prepayments for shipments
