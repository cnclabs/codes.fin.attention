table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general community bankers trust corporation the company is a bank holding company that was incorporated under delaware law on april  the company is headquartered in glen allen  virginia and is the holding company for essex bank the bank  a virginia state bank with full service offices in virginia  maryland and georgia 
the bank engages in a general commercial banking business and provides a wide range of financial services  including individual and commercial demand and time deposit accounts  commercial and industrial loans  consumer and small business loans  real estate and mortgage loans  investment services  on line and mobile banking products  and safe deposit box facilities 
thirteen branches are located in virginia  primarily from the chesapeake bay to just west of richmond  seven are located in maryland along the baltimore washington corridor and four are located in the atlanta  georgia metropolitan market 
the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
the company s cost of funds is a function of the average amount of interest bearing deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  the bank earns non interest income from service charges on deposit accounts and other fee or commission based services and products 
other sources of non interest income can include gains or losses on securities transactions  gains from loan sales  transactions involving bank owned property  and income from bank owned life insurance boli policies 
the company s income is offset by non interest expense  which consists of goodwill impairment and other charges  salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  professional fees  and other operational expenses 
the provision for loan losses and income taxes materially affect income

critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within the statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
for example  the company uses historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in its loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that the company uses 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable method to another method 
although the economics of the company s transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact its transactions could change 
the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses on non covered loans the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes is appropriate to absorb estimated losses relating to specifically identified loans  as well as probable credit losses inherent in the balance of the loan portfolio  based on an evaluation of the collectability of existing loans and prior loss experience 
this quarterly evaluation also takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
this evaluation does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
while management uses the best information available to make its evaluation  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if there are significant changes in economic conditions 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and may require the bank to make additions to the allowance based on their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examinations 

table of contents the allowance consists of specific  and general components 
for loans that are also classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  management believes that it is more likely than not that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  availability of current financial information  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial and construction loans by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
in the third quarter of  the company refined the factors used to calculate the fasb asc  contingencies  component of the allowance for loan loss to include more quantifiable information supported by current economic data 
the analysis consists of these components a linear regression analysis of historical loss data provided by the fdic  b historical losses for the company since inception on may   c risk grade migrations and delinquency migrations of the loan portfolio  and d an unallocated component to capture management s view of the overall impact of those factors discussed in the above paragraph 
this revision had an impact of a decrease to the amount of allowance for loan losses on non covered loans of approximately in the fourth quarter of  the company further refined the historical losses factor used to calculate the fasb asc  contingencies  component of the allowance for loan losses 
management has performed an assessment of all significant construction and land development loans remaining in the pool 
the company adjusted the historical losses factor to accommodate for changes in the company s underwriting standards related to the construction and land development portfolio as well as unusual events that occurred  such as fraud 
the company has adjusted the factor for significant charge offs on loans made prior to the underwriting standard changes  as they do not reflect the risk present in the current portfolio 
in addition  the company adopted an additional environmental factor related to increased credit risk in the home equity lines of credit pool 
these revisions had an impact of a decrease to the amount of allowance for loan losses on non covered loans of approximately million 
allowance for loan losses on covered loans the assets acquired in the sfsb acquisition are covered by a shared loss agreement with the fdic 
under the shared loss agreements  the fdic will reimburse the bank for of losses arising from covered loans and foreclosed real estate assets  on the first million in losses of such covered loans and foreclosed real estate assets  and for of losses on covered loans and foreclosed real estate assets thereafter 
under the shared loss agreements  a loss on a covered loan or foreclosed real estate is defined generally as a realized loss incurred through a permitted disposition  foreclosure  short sale or restructuring of the covered loan or foreclosed real estate 
the reimbursements for losses on single family one to four residential mortgage loans are to be made quarterly until the end of the quarter in which the tenth anniversary of the closing of the transaction occurs  and the reimbursements for losses on other covered assets are to be made quarterly until the end of the quarter in which the eighth anniversary of the closing of the transaction occurs 
prior to the third quarter of  reimbursements for losses on single family one to four mortgage loans were made monthly 
the shared loss agreements provide for indemnification from the first dollar of losses without any threshold requirement 
the reimbursable losses from the fdic are based on the book value of the relevant loan as determined by the fdic at the date of the transaction  january  new loans made after that date are not covered by the shared loss agreements 
the company evaluated the acquired covered loans and has elected to account for them under fasb asc the covered loans acquired are subject to credit review standards described above for non covered loans 
if and when credit deterioration occurs subsequent to the acquisition date  a provision for credit loss for covered loans will be charged to earnings for the full amount without regard to the fdic shared loss agreements 
the company makes an estimate of the total cash flows it expects to collect from a pool of covered loans  which includes undiscounted expected principal and interest 
over the life of the loan or pool  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the pool are recognized as an impairment in the current period through allowance for loan loss 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows are first used to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increase in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as an adjustment to the yield over the remaining life of the pool 
fdic indemnification asset the company is accounting for the shared loss agreements as an indemnification asset pursuant to the guidance in fasb asc the fdic indemnification asset is required to be measured in the same manner as the asset or liability to which it relates 

table of contents the fdic indemnification asset is measured separately from the covered loans and other real estate owned assets because it is not contractually embedded in the covered loan and other real estate owned assets and is not transferable should the company choose to dispose of them 
fair value was estimated using projected cash flows available for loss sharing based on the credit adjustments estimated for each loan pool and other real estate owned and the loss sharing percentages outlined in the purchase and assumption agreements with the fdic 
these cash flows were discounted to reflect the uncertainty of the timing and receipt of the loss sharing reimbursement from the fdic 
because the acquired loans are subject to a fdic loss sharing agreement and a corresponding indemnification asset exists to represent the value of expected payments from the fdic  increases and decreases in loan accretable yield due to changing loss expectations will also have an impact to the valuation of the fdic indemnification asset 
improvement in loss expectations will typically increase loan accretable yield and decrease the value of the fdic indemnification asset  and in some instances  result in an amortizable premium on the fdic indemnification asset 
increases in loss expectations will typically be recognized as impairment in the current period through allowance for loan losses while resulting in additional non interest income for the amount of the increase in the fdic indemnification asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company is accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and others 
fasb asc discontinues any amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but requires an impairment review at least annually or more often if certain conditions exist 
goodwill impairment charges of million and million were realized in and  respectively 
all of the company s goodwill has been impaired and the carrying value at december  is additionally  under fasb asc  acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the assets can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful lives the costs of purchased deposit relationships and other intangible assets  based on independent valuation by a qualified third party  are being amortized over their estimated lives 
core deposit intangible amortization expense charged to operations was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the core deposit intangible is evaluated for impairment in accordance with fasb asc overview at december   the company had total assets of billion  a decrease of million  or  from total assets of billion at december  total loans  including million in loans covered by the fdic shared loss agreements  were million at december   increasing million  or  from million at december  the carrying value of covered loans declined million  or  from december  to december  non covered loans equaled million at december   increasing million  or  since december  non covered loans increased million from september  to december  the company s securities portfolio  excluding equity securities  decreased million  or  during the year ended december  to million with realized gains of million through sales activity 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   compared with million at december  there were no federal funds sold at december   compared with million at december  the company is required to account for the effect of market changes in the value of securities available for sale afs under fasb asc  investments debt and equity securities 
the market value of the december  and december  afs portfolio was and million  respectively 
at december   the company had a net unrealized gain in the afs portfolio of million versus a net unrealized loss of  at december  bank owned life insurance increased million during the year ended december   as the company made an additional investment on december  bank owned life insurance was million at december  the income on this investment is reflected in noninterest income 
interest bearing deposits at december  were million  a decrease of million from december  management kept rates low among all of the bank s markets as loan demand remained weak and covered loans continued to decline in volume 
throughout  the company attempted to restructure the deposit mix away from higher priced deposits and more into lower cost transactional accounts 
as a result  total time deposits as a percent of total interest bearing deposits  declined from at december  to at december  the company had federal home loan bank fhlb advances aggregating million at december  and stockholders equity at december  was million  or of total assets  and increased from stockholders equity of million  or of total assets  at december  
table of contents results of operations net income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   net income increased million  or  from net loss of million in to net income of million in net income available to common stockholders was  or per common share on a diluted basis for the year ended december   compared with a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per common share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  the improvement in net income compared with was driven by a reduction of million in provision for loan losses and a reduction of million in impairment of goodwill charges 
all remaining goodwill balances were fully written off in net income was additionally aided in compared with through expense reductions of million  excluding impairment of goodwill 
for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of million compared with a net loss of million for basic and fully diluted earnings per share were for versus for  respectively 
losses for both years were primarily driven by two factors million and million in loan loss provisions in and  respectively  and non tax deductible impairment of goodwill charges of million in and million in net interest income the company s operating results depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was primarily the result of decreases of million  or  in the average balances of interest bearing liabilities coupled with lower rates  which has reduced interest expense  from million in to million in the tax equivalent net interest margin increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest and fees on non covered loans decreased million  or  to aggregate million during interest and fee income on covered loans equaled million during cost of interest bearing liabilities totaled million during of which interest on deposits was million 
this compares with million in total interest expense and million in interest on deposits  respectively in the company s total loan to deposit ratio was at december  versus at december  the ratio remained fairly constant during the year as management was successful in generating new loan growth in the later part of this was offset by a decline of million in the self liquidating covered loan portfolio 
deposit balances also declined million in which positively affected the total loan to deposit ratio 
the bank s net interest margin improved basis points during  from in  to in  mainly from management lowering the cost of funds throughout the year 
net interest income increased from million in  to million in interest and fees on non covered loans decreased million  or  to aggregate million during interest and fee income on covered loans equaled million during cost of interest bearing liabilities totaled million during of which interest on deposits was million 

table of contents the following table presents the total amount of average balances  interest income from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates

management continues to refine and enhance the methodology to amortize the indemnification asset based on the historical and projected cash flows of the fdic covered loan portfolio 
these enhancements should result in amortization of the indemnification asset that more closely correlates to the accretable yield of the fdic covered loan portfolio 
other noninterest income declined  in compared with other noninterest income was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  this decrease reflects fewer reimbursable loss events in fdic covered loans 
for the year ended december   noninterest income was million compared with million for the year ended december  the magnitude of the million change year over year was due to the one time million pre tax gain related to the acquisition of sfsb in excluding the one time gain in  noninterest income would have been million for the year  which would have resulted in a decline in noninterest income of million when comparing the year end periods 
other noninterest income for the year ended december  included net write downs and losses of  on covered other real estate in the fdic acquired sfsb portfolio  comprised of million of write downs and sales offset by million due from the fdic 
the net amount reflects the company s loss portion under the shared loss agreements with the fdic 
in addition  lower than expected losses in the covered loan portfolio resulted in a reduction of the fdic indemnification asset of million during these losses are partially offset by increased loan yield on covered loans presented in the net interest margin calculation 
service charges on deposit accounts were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  securities gains totaled million for the year ended december  compared with  for the year ended december  
table of contents provision for loan losses management actively monitors the company s asset quality and provides specific loss provisions when necessary 
provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level deemed appropriate by management of the company based on such factors as historical credit loss experience  industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio  the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral  the volume growth and composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay and the value of collateral  the evaluation of the loan portfolio through the internal loan review function and other relevant factors 
see allowance for loan losses on non covered loans in the critical accounting policies section above for further discussion 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when appropriate 
although management believes it uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the provision for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations 
management also actively monitors its covered loan portfolio for impairment and necessary loan loss provisions 
provisions for covered loans may be necessary due to a change in expected cash flows or an increase in expected losses within a pool of loans 
in  a number of factors influenced credit risk management practices  including the economy  the rising level of nonperforming assets  deterioration within the company s loan portfolio and regulatory concerns 
as a result  the company took provisions for loan losses totaling million in in  improved credit risk management  which resulted in a lower level of nonperforming assets  influenced the assessment the company makes concerning the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses and the need for a provision 
in  the company had provision for loan losses of million 
the allowance for loan losses was of non covered nonaccrual loans at december   compared with of non covered nonaccrual loans at december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non covered loans was at december   compared with at december  the decrease in this ratio from december  to december  is primarily the result of earlier recognition and resolution of problem credits and aggressive charge offs  in addition to work outs of nonperforming loans 
in addition  the bank held million in government guaranteed loans of the united states department of agriculture usda at december   with no allowance for loan losses required 
net charged off loans were million in  compared with million in net charged off loans have declined from million in the fourth quarter of  million in the first quarter of  million in the second quarter of  million in the third quarter of  and were  in the fourth quarter of the company incurred million in provision for loan losses for non covered loans for the year ended december  and a million provision for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming non covered loans was at december  compared with at december  the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total non covered loans was at december  compared with at december  net charge offs were million during compared with million during the increase in charge offs during was mainly the result of more aggressive action taken related to non performing loans 
the increase to the loan loss reserves as a percentage of total non covered loans during reflects economic conditions that continued to show signs of deterioration for classified assets 
the significant loan loss provision for the year was due primarily to an increase in non performing loans of million since december  and a desire to further insulate from the economic downturn 
for the year ended december   a provision for loan losses on the covered loan portfolio of  established an allowance for covered loan losses of the same amount 
this provision was due solely to timing differences in expected cash flows  not an increase in expected losses 
this provision occurred in the second quarter of and is in accordance with fasb asc there was no provision for loan losses on the covered loan portfolio in the allowance for covered loans was  at december   and  at december  while the maryland loan portfolio contains significant risk  it was considered in determining the initial fair value  which was reflected in adjustments recorded at the time of the sfsb transaction  less the fdic guaranteed portion of losses on covered assets 
please refer to the asset quality discussion below for further analysis 
noninterest expenses for the year ended december   noninterest expenses declined  or million 
excluding an impairment of goodwill charge taken in  noninterest expenses would have declined by million  or  as of expense categories 
table of contents exhibited declines during compared to the largest decrease occurred in salaries and employee benefits  which declined  or million  from million in to million in professional fees declined  or million  from million in to  in other decreases of  or more occurred in data processing  which declined  in and equipment expense  which declined  offsetting these decreases in noninterest expenses in compared with were increases in other operating expenses of  from million in to million in and fdic assessment  which increased by  from million to million 
for the year ended december   noninterest expenses aggregated million compared with million for the year ended december  the largest component of the decrease was the million in goodwill impairment charges during excluding the goodwill impairment charges of million and million during and  respectively  total noninterest expense declined million or 
salary and employee benefits were million at december  versus million at december   a decrease of million  or 
lower salary and employee benefit expense was the direct result of management implementing an expense reduction initiative that included the elimination of certain management level positions and the planned centralization of remaining support services from the maryland and georgia operations to the company s virginia headquarters 
during  noninterest expenses were million  inclusive of the aforementioned million in goodwill impairment charges 
salaries and employee benefits were million and represented of noninterest expense  exclusive of the goodwill impairment charge 
during  the management team expanded  providing additional depth to the management of the company during a time of rapid growth 
in february  the company approved two transaction based bonus awards in the aggregate amount of million to the officer who was the company s then chief strategic officer 
the approval of the bonus awards was made pursuant to a provision in the officer s employment agreement that provides for a cash bonus payment for financial advisory and other services that the officer renders in connection with the negotiation and consummation of a merger or other business combination or the acquisition of a substantial portion of the assets or deposits of another financial institution 
the bonus awards related to the officer s services with respect to the bank s acquisition of certain assets and assumption of all deposit liabilities of four former branch offices of tcb in november and the bank s acquisition of certain assets and assumption of all deposit liabilities of seven former branch offices of sfsb in january the amounts of the bonuses are based on  with respect to the tcb transaction  the total amount of non brokered deposits that the bank assumed in that transaction and  with respect to the sfsb transaction  the total amount of loans and other assets that the bank acquired in that transaction  and the company looked closely at a number of factors  including the value that each of the transactions provided the company  in approving the bonuses 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company reflected these bonuses in the financial statements for the year and three months ended december  see note to the company s financial information for additional information with respect to these bonus awards 
other noninterest expense costs during included other operating expenses of million  data processing fees of million  occupancy expenses of million  fdic assessments of million  amortization of core deposit intangibles of million  professional fees of million  equipment expense of million  and legal fees of  other noninterest expense costs during included other operating expenses of million  data processing fees of million  occupancy expenses of million  fdic assessments of million  amortization of core deposit intangibles of million  professional fees of million  equipment expense of million  and legal fees of million 
income taxes for the year ended december   income tax expense was  compared with an income tax benefit of million and income tax expense of  for each of the years ended december  and the company has evaluated the need for a deferred tax valuation allowance for the years ended december  and in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
based on a three year taxable income projection  tax strategies which would result in potential securities gains and the effects of off setting deferred tax liabilities  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable 
therefore  no allowance was required 
income tax expense during relative to the net operating loss is directly attributable to the goodwill impairment charges taken during the year and the company s inability to use it as a tax deduction  despite the substantial reduction to earnings 
asset quality non covered assets the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 

table of contents non covered loan quality is continually monitored  and the company s management has established an allowance for loan losses that it believes is appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
among other factors  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the loan portfolio  the value and appropriateness of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits and current and anticipated economic conditions 
there are additional risks of future loan losses  which cannot be precisely quantified nor attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends  as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to appropriateness  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies 
see allowance for loan losses on non covered loans in the critical accounting policies section above for further discussion 
the company maintains a list of non covered loans that have potential weaknesses which may need special attention 
this nonperforming loan list is used to monitor such loans and is used in the determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled million and net charge offs were million 
this compares with nonperforming assets of million and net charge offs of million for the year ended december  nonperforming non covered loans decreased million during  attributable to approximately million being placed in nonaccrual status 
approximately million of these additions relate to loans for commercial real estate  residential real estate  and construction and land development  which are secured by real estate 
the remaining increase in nonperforming loans during are all smaller credit relationships 
offsetting the additions were million in charge offs taken during  of which one commercial loan totaled million 
the remaining charge offs were centered in commercial real estate  construction and land development  residential real estate  and commercial loans 
foreclosures for totaled million  million were reinstated to accruing status  and million in balances were paid down 
nonperforming non covered loans increased million during  attributable to approximately million being placed in nonaccrual status 
approximately million of these additions relate to loans for commercial real estate and construction and land development  which are secured by real estate 
the remaining increase in nonperforming loans during are all smaller credit relationships 
these loans are primarily residential real estate and are secured by real estate 
there were approximately million in charge offs taken relating primarily to commercial real estate  construction and land development  and residential real estate loans during during the second quarter of  the company added a new risk grade  special mention  to its risk grade methodology  which expanded the risk grades from eight to nine 
the company defines the population of potentially impaired loans as those classified as substandard and doubtful 
the addition of the new risk grade had no material impact on the dollar amount of substandard and doubtful loans 
as a part of its risk grade migration plan  the company hired an independent third party to evaluate  confirm and classify approximately of the non covered loan portfolio because of the new risk grade and consisting of the following described loans all loans or loan relationships of million or greater  all acquisition development and construction loans of  or greater  watch loans and classified impaired loans  or greater  and a statistical sampling of all other loans with an exposure between  and million 
as a result of this credit review there was a migration of approximately million from special mention into substandard and doubtful that are the impaired loan categories 
the above mentioned changes increased the dollar amount of impaired loans reported in the second quarter of these loans were analyzed pursuant to fasb asc and incrementally increased the allowance for loans losses in the amount of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that as a result of credit downgrades due to perceived credit weakness its risk grade definition that had previously comprised impaired loans substandard and doubtful included some loans that were not impaired under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the gaap definition states that an individual loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
as a consequence  the company determined that it had inadvertently overstated the amount of impaired loans during the second and third quarters of  by million and million  respectively based on the definition used at december  as the substandard and doubtful loans included loans rated such due to collateral deficiencies or financial documentation weaknesses  which did not in itself indicate impairment 
notwithstanding this situation  the company does not believe that this misstatement had any material impact on the allowance for loan losses calculation as the portion of the allowance for unimpaired loans would have increased as a result of the weaknesses identified 
the company has modified its application of the definition of impaired loans to include all troubled debt restructured and nonaccrual loans 
in addition  the company reviews all substandard and doubtful loans that are not on nonaccrual status  as well as loans with other risk characteristics  pursuant to and specifically for compliance with the accounting definition of impairment as described above 
these impaired loans have been determined through analysis  appraisals  or other methods used by management

the borrowers for eight of these relationships are residential land developers  and the borrowers under the remaining three are commercial land developers 
all of the relationships are secured by the real estate to be developed  and almost all of such projects are in the company s central virginia market 
the total amount of the credit exposure outstanding at december  was million 
these loans have either been charged down or sufficiently reserved against to equate to the current expected realizable value 
during the  the company charged off million with respect to three of these relationships 
the total amount of the allowance for loan losses attributed to all relationships was  at december   or of the total credit exposure outstanding 
the company establishes its reserves as described above in allowance for loan losses on non covered loans in the critical accounting policies section 
in conjunction with the impairment analysis the company performs as part of its allowance methodology  the company ordered appraisals for all loans with balances in excess of  unless there existed an appraisal that was not older than months 
the company orders an automated valuation for balances between  and  and uses a ratio analysis for balances less than  the company maintains detailed analysis and other information for its allowance methodology  both for internal purposes and for review by its regulators 
the company performs troubled debt restructures and other various loan workouts whereby an existing loan may be restructured into multiple new loans 
at december  and  the company had loans that met the definition of a troubled debt restructure tdr  which are loans that for reasons related to the debtor s financial difficulties have been restructured on terms and conditions that would otherwise not be offered or granted 
two of these loans was restructured using multiple new loans 
loans are removed as a tdr if after a year following the restructuring  the loan is performing in accordance with the terms of the restructuring agreement and the restructuring agreement specifies an interest rate equal to or greater than the rate the company was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan of comparable risk 
at december  and  the aggregated outstanding principal of these loans was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  was classified as nonaccural 
the primary benefit of the restructured multiple loan workout strategy is to maximize the potential return by restructuring the loan into a good loan the a loan and a bad loan the b loan 
the impact on interest is positive because the bank is collecting interest on the a loan rather than potentially foregoing interest on the entire original loan structure 
the a loan is underwritten pursuant to the bank s standard requirements and graded accordingly 
the b loan is classified as either doubtful or loss 
an impairment analysis is performed on the b loan  and  based on its results  all or a portion of the b note is charged off or a specific loan loss reserve is established 

table of contents the company does not modify its nonaccrual policies in this arrangement  and the a loan and the b loan stand on their own terms 
at the time of its inception  this structure meets the definition of a tdr 
if the loan is on nonaccrual at the time of restructure  the a loan is held on nonaccrual until six consecutive payments have been received  at which time it may be put back on an accrual status 
the b loan is placed on nonaccrual 
under the terms of each loan  the borrower s payment is contractually due 
the following table presents the composition of the company s nonaccrual loans and nonaccrual loans as a percentage of the company s total gross non covered loans as of december dollars in thousands mortgage loans on real estate residential family commercial construction and land development second mortgages multifamily agriculture total real estate loans commercial loans consumer installment loans all other loans gross loans see note to the company s financial statements for information related to the allowance for loan losses 
as of december  and december   total impaired non covered loans equaled million and million  respectively 
asset quality covered assets loans accounted for under fasb asc are generally considered accruing and performing loans as the loans accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan 
accordingly  acquired impaired loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans 
the company makes an estimate of the total cash flows that it expects to collect from a pool of covered loans  which include undiscounted expected principal and interest 
over the life of the loan or pool  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the pool are recognized as impairment in the current period through the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows are first used to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increase in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as an adjustment to the yield over the remaining life of the pool

table of contents capital requirements the determination of capital adequacy depends upon a number of factors  such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings  growth trends and economic conditions 
the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion plans  provide stability to current operations and promote public confidence in the company 
the federal banking regulators have defined three tests for assessing the capital strength and adequacy of banks  based on two definitions of capital 
tier capital is defined as common equity  retained earnings and qualifying perpetual preferred stock  less certain intangibles 
tier capital is defined as specific subordinated debt  some hybrid capital instruments and other qualifying preferred stock and a limited amount of the loan loss allowance 
total capital is defined as tier capital plus tier capital 
three risk based capital ratios are computed using the above capital definitions  total assets and risk weighted assets and are measured against regulatory minimums to ascertain adequacy 
all assets and off balance sheet risk items are grouped into categories according to degree of risk and assigned a risk weighting and the resulting total is risk weighted assets 
tier risk based capital is tier capital divided by risk weighted assets 
total risk based capital is total capital divided by risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio is tier capital divided by adjusted average total assets 
the company s ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the company s leverage ratio was on december  the company s ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the company s leverage ratio was on december  all capital ratios exceed regulatory minimums for well capitalized institutions as referenced in note to the consolidated financial statements

as of december   securities equaled million  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
at december   the company had securities designated available for sale of million and held to maturity of million  with equity securities totaling million 
the increase in the securities portfolio was due to the decline in total loan demand  as excess deposit balances were invested accordingly

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of interest rate risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern the company s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 

table of contents interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with the company s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of the company s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over various periods  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated monthly 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point upward shift and a basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
the following table represents the change to net interest income given interest rate shocks up and down and basis points at december   and dollars in thousands change in net interest income change in yield curve bp bp most likely bp bp at december   the company s interest rate risk model indicated that  in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period  net interest income could decrease by 
for the same time period  the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points  net interest income could increase by 
while these percentages are subjective based upon assumptions used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is appropriately balanced with acceptable risk to changes in interest rates 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels such as yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to  or in anticipation of  changes in interest rates
