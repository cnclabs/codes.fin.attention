item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
words such as may  could  would  should  expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  estimate and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on our current expectations and projections about future events  are not guarantees of future performance  are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions including those described herein and apply only as of the date of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled risk factors as well as those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant trends and material changes in our financial condition and operating results during the period from through overview we are an integrated media company 
we own and operate full power including a owned television station and seven low power television stations and three owned radio stations in addition to one managed radio station 
our television stations are located in washington  oregon  idaho and california  and our radio stations are located in washington 
we lease a significant amount of the space at fisher plaza  a mixed use facility in seattle  washington  that serves as the home for our corporate offices and our seattle television and radio stations 
we had owned fisher plaza until its sale in december in connection with the sale  we leased back our existing space for an initial year term  as discussed in greater detail below 
our broadcasting operations receive revenue from the sale of local  regional and national advertising and  to a much lesser extent  from retransmission consent fees  tower rental and commercial production activities 
our operating results are  therefore  sensitive to broad economic trends that affect the broadcasting industry in general  as well as local and regional trends  particularly those affecting the pacific northwest economy 
the advertising revenue of our stations is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring  and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during national election years due to spending by political candidates and advocacy groups 
this political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
our television revenue is significantly affected by network affiliation and the success of programming offered by those networks 
our two largest television stations  komo tv and katu tv  accounted for approximately percent of our television broadcasting revenue in and are affiliated with the abc television network 
we have twelve television stations which are affiliated with one of the four major networks 
six of our television stations are affiliated with univision spanish language and the remainder of our television stations are independent or subscribe to various programming services 
our affiliation agreements with the abc television network will expire in august our affiliation agreements with the cbs television network generally expire in february our affiliation agreement with fox television network for kbfx ca in bakersfield  california  expires in june our affiliation agreement with univision expires in december the non renewal of any of our major network affiliation agreements could adversely affect our business and results 
our broadcasting operations are subject to competitive pressures from traditional broadcasting sources  as well as from alternative methods of delivering information and entertainment  and these pressures may cause fluctuations in operating results 
in addition to our broadcasting operations  prior to its sale on december   we owned and operated fisher plaza and we leased space within the facility to other companies that were attracted by the property location and its infrastructure 
at december   approximately of fisher plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy occupied by fisher entities  which was unchanged from december  in conjunction with the sale of fisher plaza we entered into a year lease pursuant to which we leased approximately  rentable square feet of fisher plaza 
our corporate headquarters  seattle television  radio and internet operations continue to be located in our leased space at fisher plaza 
management focuses on key metrics from operational data within our broadcasting and fisher plaza operations 
information on significant trends is provided in the section entitled consolidated results of operations 
significant developments the following significant developments affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and sale and leaseback of fisher plaza 
in december  we completed the sale of fisher plaza to hines global reit hines for million in cash 
in connection with the sale of fisher plaza we entered into a lease the lease with hines pursuant to which we leased  rentable square feet of fisher plaza 
the lease has an initial term that expires on december  and the company has the right to extend the term for three successive five year periods 
our corporate headquarters and seattle television  radio and internet operations continue to be located at fisher plaza 
given our sale of fisher plaza in december  our consolidated results in and in future years will not include any revenue  operating expense or depreciation from fisher plaza  and will include rent expense  related to the lease with hines 
sale of great falls  montana radio stations 
in october  we completed the sale of our six great falls  montana radio stations the montana stations to staradio corp 
staradio  which is based in quincy  illinois for million  subject to certain adjustments 
in accordance with authoritative guidance we have reported the results of operations of the montana stations as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements 
sale of real estate 
in june  we completed the sale of two real estate parcels in seattle  washington not essential to current operations and received million in net proceeds and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
expiration of king fm agreement 
in may  our joint sales agreement with the classical music station king fm expired and was not renewed 
as a result we no longer record advertising revenue and operating expenses related to king fm subsequent to the expiration of the agreement 
joint sales agreement 
effective january   we entered into a ten year joint sales agreement jsa with npg of idaho  inc  a subsidiary of news press gazette company npg  who owns and operates kifi tv an idaho falls  idaho television station 
under the agreement  npg provides certain services supporting the operation of our television station in idaho falls  kidk tv  and sells substantially all of the commercial advertising on our station 
we pay npg a non material fixed fee pursuant to the agreement  and a performance bonus based on station performance 
contemporaneously  with the jsa  we entered into an option agreement with npg  whereby they have a conditional option to acquire kidk tv until january   effective on the expiration or termination of the indenture governing our senior notes 
acme agreement 
in march  we entered into a three year consulting and license agreement with acme television  llc acme which was effective april  under the terms of the agreement we provide consulting services to acme s the daily buzz television show and we also license certain assets of the program in order to produce unique content to be distributed on both traditional broadcast and newly created digital platforms 
in conjunction with the agreement  we were granted an option to purchase the ownership rights to the daily buzz until september  this agreement does not meet the criteria for consolidation 
revenue earned under this agreement is recorded in revenue and programming and other expenses are recorded in operating costs 
datasphere investment 
in december  we purchased shares of series b preferred stock of datasphere technologies  inc datasphere for million in cash 
datasphere is a software as a service web technology and hyperlocal ad sales company focused on generating online profits for media companies 
since august  we have utilized datasphere s technology and sales solution to launch over hyperlocal neighborhood websites 
we also work with datasphere in its distribution of its technology and sales solution to other broadcast companies looking to establish hyperlocal sites 
see business internet business hyperlocal websites

during the years ended december  and  we received  and million  respectively of insurance reimbursements 
during the year ended december   we recorded expenses of million  consisting of a million loss on fixed assets destroyed by the fire plus the above mentioned million of remediation expenses offset by million of insurance reimbursements 
retransmission agreements 
in the fourth quarter of and during we executed retransmission consent agreements with substantially all of our satellite and cable distribution partners  in the fourth quarter of we began the process of renewing these contracts

the station broadcasts our komo news radio programming to fm listeners in the seattle tacoma radio market 
contemporaneously with the lma  we entered into an option agreement with south sound  whereby we have the right to acquire the station until may  if we do not exercise the option prior to its expiration date  we are obligated to pay south sound up to approximately million 
advertising revenue earned under this lma is recorded as revenue and lma fees and programming expenses are recorded as operating costs 
termination of national advertising representation agreement 
in april  we terminated the agreement with our national advertising representation firm 
the successor firm will satisfy our contractual termination obligation to the predecessor firm with no cash payment required by us 
in the second quarter of  we recognized a net non cash termination charge of million to selling  general and administrative expenses and we are amortizing the resulting deferred credit as a non cash reduction in costs associated with our national advertising representation firm over the five year term of the new agreement 
we recognized a million benefit due to this amortization for the years ended december   and critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including  but not limited to  those affecting revenues  goodwill and intangibles impairment  the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables and broadcast rights  stock based compensation expense  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes and liabilities and contingencies 
the brief discussion below is intended to highlight some of the judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them  as presented in this annual report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of certain media properties over the fair value of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible net assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist of certain television licenses primarily fcc licenses 
in making estimates of fair values for the purposes of allocating the purchase price  we rely primarily on our extensive knowledge of the market and  if considered appropriate  will obtain valuations from independent third party specialists 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained as a result of pre acquisition due diligence  including third party reports that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective assets 
we evaluate the potential for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
under new accounting guidance adopted for  we evaluate qualitative factors  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors and overall financial performance to determine whether it is necessary to perform the first step of the two step goodwill test 
this step is referred to as step 
step involves  among other qualitative factors  weighing the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors 
reporting unit specific factors are considered  including the results of the most recent impairment tests  as well as financial performance and changes to the reporting units carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests 
the company considers industry and macroeconomic factors  including growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry  during the period of evaluation and assesses if the factors have a positive  neutral or negative impact on the fair value of each reporting unit 
after assessing those various factors  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the entity will need to proceed to the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with the carrying amounts of net assets  including goodwill  related to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit s fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill in the reporting unit being tested 
fair values are determined based on valuations that rely primarily on the discounted cash flow method and market multiples of current earnings 
this method uses future projections of cash flows from each of our reporting units and includes  among other estimates  projections of future advertising revenue and operating expenses  market supply and demand  projected capital spending and an assumption of our weighted average cost of capital  as adjusted for market participant data 
our indefinite lived assets broadcast licenses  which are not subject to amortization  are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis by applying a fair value based test as required 
our evaluations of fair values include analyses based on the estimated future cash flows generated by the underlying assets  estimated trends  and other relevant determinants of fair value for these assets 
if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and its carrying value 
changes in any of these estimates  projections and assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of these assets in future measurement periods and result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles which could materially affect our results of operations 
the impairment test for fcc licenses consists of a station by station comparison of the carrying amount of fcc licenses with their fair value  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we believe our estimate of the value of our goodwill and broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
tangible long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we use our judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment analysis is necessary 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment analysis include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or significant negative cash flows or industry trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is primarily based on market transactions for comparable businesses  discounted cash flows and a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit 
in estimating future cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and that were expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these projections rely on significant assumptions 
if it is determined that a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
changes in any of our estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and could result in a future impairment of the involved assets with a material effect on our future results of operations 
television broadcast rights 
television broadcast rights are recorded as assets when the license period begins and the programs are available for broadcast  at the gross amount of the related obligations or  for non sports first run programming  at the amount of the annual obligation 
costs incurred in connection with the purchase of programs to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets  while costs of those programs to be broadcast after one year are considered non current 
these programming costs are charged to operations over their estimated broadcast periods using the straight line method 
program obligations are classified as current or non current in accordance with the payment terms of the license agreement 
revenue recognition 
television and radio revenue is recognized  net of advertising agency commissions  when the advertisement is broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
we may trade certain advertising time for products or services  as well as barter advertising time for program material 
trade transactions are generally reported at the estimated fair value of the product or service received  while barter transactions are reported at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
revenue is reported on trade and barter transactions when commercials are broadcast and expenses are reported when products or services are utilized or when programming airs 
we receive consideration from certain satellite  cable and wireless providers in return for consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations 
revenues from retransmission consent and satellite transmission services are recognized when the service is performed and collection is considered probable 
revenue from production of broadcast media content is recognized when a contracted production is available for distribution 
website advertising revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
rentals from broadcast tower and real estate leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
accrued retirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory supplemental retirement program that was established for key management 
no new participants have been admitted to this program since and the benefits of active participants were frozen in the program participants do not include any of our current executive officers 
the program provides for vesting of benefits under certain circumstances 
funding is not required  but we have made investments in annuity contracts and maintain life insurance policies on the lives of the individual participants to assist in our payment of retirement benefits 
we are the owner and beneficiary of the annuity contracts and life insurance policies 
accordingly  the cash value of the annuity contracts and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the supplemental retirement program requires continued employment or disability through the date of expected retirement 
the cost of the program is recognized over the participants average expected future lifetime 
the cost of this program is reported and accounted for in accordance with accounting rules that require significant assumptions regarding such factors as discount rates 
we use an independent actuarial consulting firm to assist in estimating the supplemental retirement obligation and related periodic expenses 
the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was at december  and at december  the rate of increase in future compensation was no longer applicable due to freezing plan benefits for active participants 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results could differ from our estimates 
changes in benefits provided by us may also affect future plan costs 
income taxes 
the preparation of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in assessing whether  and to what extent  deferred tax assets can be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover some or all our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of our deferred tax assets not considered recoverable 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in expectations and actual future results could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
during the fourth quarter of  we released million of our valuation allowance based on the analysis of all available evidence 
at december   we had a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in the need to increase the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
our federal and state income tax returns are subject to periodic examination and the tax authorities may challenge certain of our tax positions as a result of examinations 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the tax authorities could require us to make additional tax payments 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are sometimes ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make certain subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
accordingly  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
we record interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense 
as of december   we had  of unrecognized tax benefits which includes the estimated usage of net operating losses from those years 
no penalties or interest was accrued on the unrecognized tax benefit 
if our unrecognized tax benefits were recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
no reserves for uncertain income tax positions were recorded for the years ended december  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on factors such as the level of past due balances for each business unit  as well as changes in current economic conditions 
variable interest entities 
we may enter into jsas or lmas with non owned stations 
under the terms of these agreements  we make specific periodic payments to the station s owner operator in exchange for the right to provide programming and or sell advertising on a portion of the station s broadcast time 
nevertheless  the owner operator retains control and responsibility for the operation of the station  including responsibility over all programming broadcast on the station 
generally  we continue to operate the station and sell advertising under the lma agreement and sell advertising under the jsa agreement until the termination of such agreement 
as a result of these agreements  we may determine that the station is a variable interest entity vie and that we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest 
we also may determine that a station is a vie in connection with other types of local service agreements entered into with stations in markets in which we own and operate a station 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
our estimation of the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected life of the award  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  forfeitures and projected exercise behaviors 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
consolidated results of operations we report financial data for three reportable segments television  radio and fisher plaza 
the television segment includes the operations of our owned and operated television stations including a owned television station and internet business 
the radio segment includes the operations of our three owned radio stations and one managed radio station 
the fisher plaza segment consists of the operations of fisher plaza  a retail  office and communications center located near downtown seattle that serves as the home of our seattle based television and radio operations and our corporate offices 
on december  we sold fisher plaza and leased back our existing space pursuant to a year lease agreement 
as a result  we will no longer be reporting the fisher plaza segment in future periods 
we disclose information about our reportable segments based on the measures we use in assessing the performance of those reportable segments 
we use segment income loss from continuing operations to measure the operating performance of our segments which represents income loss from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  gain on sale of real estate  net  gain on sale of fisher plaza  net  plaza fire expenses reimbursements  net  and gain on exchange of assets  net 
additionally  the performance metric for segment income loss from continuing operations excludes the allocation of certain corporate and fisher plaza operating expense as management does not review our reportable segments with those allocations

this update simplifies the goodwill impairment test and allows companies to first decide whether they need to perform the two step test by allowing them to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for assessing whether it is necessary to perform the two step impairment test
