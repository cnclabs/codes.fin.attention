item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we report segment information based on how we view our business for evaluating performance and making operating decisions 
for the periods discussed in this item  we report results on the basis of one reportable segment 
this segment focuses on providing material based solutions for acoustical and coated applications 
our acoustical material based solutions consist of layers of metal and other coated materials used to manage noise and vibration in such products as automotive body panel parts  brake dampers  engine parts  appliances  electronics  and other industrial applications 
our coated material based solutions include coil coated  electrogalvanized eg and film protective and decorative coatings applied to coils of metal in a continuous  high speed  roll to roll process for such products as automotive fuel tanks  building products  gaskets  appliances and lighting fixtures 
we use a significant level of shared assets and resources across each of our product categories 
it is common for a single customer or end user to purchase products from several product categories 
we have taken steps in recent years to adjust our capacity to match market needs and to exit certain low profitability coil coating markets 
these actions were taken because we recognized that the coil coating marketplace had excess capacity  which was having a negative effect on our results 
leaving these markets allows us to focus our activities in higher margin  more specialized products 
these were the significant steps taken during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  management implemented restructuring plans that resulted in the elimination of production and sg a positions 
in april  we sold a portion of our coil coating assets including the coil coating machinery  related processing equipment  and corresponding customer base associated with our plant in elk grove village  illinois elk grove village 
in june  we sold the idled facility and related production equipment located in middletown  ohio middletown 
see additional discussion of all these transactions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  msc improved its profitability by moving away from low margin coil coated products and reducing excess capacity and overhead costs 
the company also generated cash by selling the excess non performing assets 
while total sales have declined slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal  income before taxes both in absolute dollars and a percent of sales has improved over this period 
however  the sale of the coil coating assets has us more dependent on fewer customers  and on a smaller selection of products  than in prior years 
although msc has engaged in significant sales of production assets in recent years  it is unlikely this will continue 
we will consider selling other non core assets if the circumstances are appropriate 
at the end of fiscal  based on the weight of available evidence  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance and a charge to tax expense of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal during fiscal and  we continued to be uncertain whether all these assets will be realized 
we have been able to use some of the deferred tax assets to offset tax expense resulting from the generation of taxable income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized  based on the weight of available evidence  including improved results over the three fiscal years ended february  therefore  we reversed most of the valuation allowance remaining at february   recording a tax benefit of million 
we continue to maintain a small valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets which we continue to believe may not be realizable

acoustical sales declined million 
body panel laminate sales declined million  due primarily to million in lower shipments to general motors gm  as some models containing quiet steel have gone out of production and gm stopped using the technology on certain other models  and million of lower shipments to chrysler due to lower builds of vehicles which use our product partially offset by higher sales for ford applications 
sales related to engine products declined million due to lower sales to automotive manufacturers partially offset by higher sales to class truck manufacturers 
brake sales declined by million  with higher sales to asian and european customers offsetting lower north american after market shipments 
all other sales decreased by million 
sales of coated metal products increased million 
the increase was driven by million in stronger sales of eg products used primarily in automotive body panel applications  as well as million in higher sales from our electrobrite product 
the prior year sale of coil coating assets at the elk grove village plant  and the associated revenue  accounted for a million reduction in net sales 
fuel tank sales decreased million because certain vehicles at ford have converted from the coated steel supplied by msc to plastic fuel tank materials 
other coated sales accounted for an increase of million  primarily in products used in lighting 
returns and allowances a component of net sales improved by million mainly due to higher scrap sales associated with a higher production volume mix 

table of contents gross profit 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  for fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  for fiscal this change resulted primarily from the two factors detailed below sales and operating factors accounted for a million increase in gross profit  reflecting an improvement in the coated metal sales mix and gross margin due to lower volumes of coil coating sales  and higher sales of eg coated metal  partially offset by higher material costs 
the cost of non conformance product quality  net of scrap sales improved by million from a year ago because scrap metal sales which are a byproduct of our manufacturing process increased 
this increase was partially offset by higher product claim and production scrap expenses 
sg a expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  lower than fiscal s million 
the main reason for the improvement was a million decrease in expense for the directors phantom stock incentive program because of a smaller increase in the market price of the company s stock compared to last year and decreases in professional fees of million and depreciation expense of million 
these improvements were partially offset by higher product development and employee expenses of million due to expanding sales and product development efforts to accelerate our growth 
restructuring 
restructuring expenses were million  lower than fiscal s million 
the amount is lower because we engaged in fewer restructuring activities in the current year 
see note  restructuring  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of our restructuring activities 
total other income  net 
total other income  net  was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the decrease was due to higher interest expense in our german subsidiary  as discussed in note  german subsidy  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item total other income  net includes rental income of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the rental income was from leases in our elk grove village plant  which had operating expenses of million including depreciation of million and million including depreciation of million recorded in sg a during the twelve months ended february  and february   respectively 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was a benefit of in fiscal as compared with an expense of in fiscal the change was primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance on our us and german deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal see note  income taxes  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal in thousands fav unfav variance fav unfav variance net sales gross profit of net sales selling  general and administrative of net sales net sales in thousands net sales application fiscal fiscal variance variance acoustical coated total 
table of contents sales were relatively flat between fiscal years  decreasing by million 
acoustical sales increased by million due to strong demand for our products from our automotive customers 
body panel laminate sales for fiscal year decreased by million mainly due to lower shipments to general motors as some models containing quiet steel have gone out of production  and general motors stopped using the technology on certain models 
this decrease was partially offset by higher body panel laminate sales to ford and chrysler 
in addition  sales of quiet steel increased million because of higher demand in the automotive market for brakes and engine related products  as well as a move toward a new application in the appliance market 
returns and allowances a component of net sales improved by million due to reductions in customer claims and scrap  plus higher revenues generated by scrap sales 
sales of coated metal products declined overall by million 
the sale of coil coating assets at the elk grove village facility accounted for a million reduction 
this facility primarily served the appliance and building products markets 
fuel tank sales to ford decreased by million because certain vehicles at ford have converted to plastic fuel tank materials from the coated steel supplied by msc 
these lower volumes were offset by stronger shipments of eg and gasket products used in automotive applications  as well as higher sales from the launch of our new electrobrite product  all of which increased sales by million versus prior year 
returns and allowances a component of net sales improved by million due to improvements in product mix lower coil coating and higher eg  product quality and scrap sales 
gross profit 
our fiscal gross profit was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
the million increase in gross profit for fiscal year came from two primary factors detailed below sales and operating impacts accounted for an million increase in gross profit due to the sales mix improved because of lower coil coating sales due to the elk grove village asset sale  and higher electrogalvanized coated metal and automotive acoustical shipments 
excess capacity and production overhead costs were reduced by selling the elk grove village coil coating production assets 
the fiscal restructuring reduced operational overhead positions 
the cost of non conformance product quality  net of scrap sales improved by million from a year ago coil coating sales  which had a high cost of non conformance  were down due to the elk grove village asset sale 
a one time fiscal million warranty expense related to the sold morrisville facility was not repeated in fiscal scrap metal sales  which are a byproduct of our manufacturing process  increased by million due to higher production volumes and improved scrap pricing in the secondary market 
overall quality improvements were made in the ongoing operations 
sg a expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a were million  lower than fiscal s million 
the main reasons for the improvement were decreases of million in headcount related expenses resulting from the restructuring plans implemented in fiscal and  as well as lower spending on professional fees of million  product development of million  and other discretionary expenses of million 
these improvements were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expenses of million due to the reinstatement of the management incentive program in fiscal  as well as million higher expense for the directors phantom stock incentive program  which increased due to the increase in the market price of the company s stock 
gain on sale of assets  asset impairment charges and restructuring 
the gain on sale of assets in fiscal of million was due to the sale of our middletown  ohio  facility and the sale of certain production assets in our elk grove village plant see notes  middletown asset sale and  elk grove village asset sale  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of the sales 
we did not sell any assets during fiscal we recorded a charge of million to reflect the impairment of the real estate and building improvement assets at our elk grove village plant in fiscal and a charge of million to reflect the impairment of the real estate assets at our middletown  ohio  facility in fiscal see notes  asset impairment  and  middletown asset sale in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of the impairments 

table of contents restructuring expenses in fiscal were million  lower than fiscal s million 
the amount is lower because the fiscal restructuring plan  executed in conjunction with the sale of certain production assets in our elk grove village plant  had a smaller scope  only affecting certain positions at plant the fiscal restructuring plan affected positions company wide 
see note  restructuring  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of our restructuring activities 
total other income  net 
total other income  net  was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase was driven principally by rental income  which increased million due to the lease of a portion of our elk grove village plant facility 
we also received dividends of million from participating annuities purchased in as part of a pension plan that was terminated in these increases were partially offset by a reduction of interest income of million due to the settlement of the note receivable we held in connection with the sale of the morrisville facility 
equity in results of joint venture resulted in income of million in both fiscal and fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled joint venture 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was an expense of in fiscal as compared with a benefit of in fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher state income taxes as a result of new laws enacted during fiscal and the maintenance of a full valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations with funds generated from operating activities  borrowings under credit facilities and sales of various assets 
we believe that our cash on hand and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal compared with million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the main components of cash generated from operating activities consisted of net income of million  positive cash flow of million from changes in working capital and a cash dividend received from tekno of million 
this was offset by non cash activities of million  consisting of the tax provision of million  depreciation of million  changes in our deferred tax assets of million  our portion of net income from tekno of million  and stock incentive plan expense of million 
the million increase in cash generated from operations from fiscal to fiscal is due to several factors a million payment from a significant customer was received on march   rather than february   resulting in a million increase in fiscal s cash generated compared to fiscal fiscal net income after adjustment for non cash items increased by million over the prior year 
fiscal included severance payments of million resulting from the restructuring activities we had in fiscal and early fiscal severance payments in fiscal were million  or million lower than the prior year 
other working capital changes  principally inventory  generated million more cash in fiscal than in fiscal in fiscal  we invested million in capital improvement projects compared with million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the fiscal investments were primarily to improve productivity and expand our production and product testing capabilities 
fiscal capital expenditures are projected to be approximately million 
in december  we sold the morrisville assets and received million in cash and a note receivable for million 
in february  the note was increased to million for inventory sold to the buyer 
we received million in principal payments through february   reduced the note balance by million in consideration for the transfer of all warranty liability to the buyer  and the buyer paid million and retired the note in the first quarter of fiscal in april  we sold a portion of our coil coating assets  including the coil coating machinery  related processing equipment and corresponding customer base associated with our plant in elk grove village to roll coater  inc for million million after investment banking fees 
in addition  
table of contents we entered into a three year lease agreement to store the purchased equipment 
the transaction did not include the sale of any real estate by msc 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately million net of fees in the first quarter of fiscal msc also recorded million of employee termination benefit expenses and million of inventory write off expenses in connection with the sale 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled elk grove village asset sale for further discussion 
in june  we sold the idled facility and related production equipment located in middletown  ohio to nci group for million 
the company recorded a gain on the sale of approximately million net of fees in the second quarter of fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled middletown asset sale for further discussion 
the company has a credit line line with jpmorgan chase bank  na interest on the line is at the bank s prime rate as of february  or libor plus  at our discretion 
there are annual letter of credit fees of on outstanding letters of credit and a fee on the annual unused credit line 
the line is secured by a borrowing base equal to a specified percentage of accounts receivable and liens on other assets of the company including inventory  equipment  real property and intellectual property  reduced by outstanding letters of credit  and may require consent from the lender before any significant sales of the equipment or real property securing the line 
in april  the line was amended to reduce the credit line to million and increase the minimum availability covenant to million 
in may  the line was amended to extend the expiration date from may   to may  the line does not contain any material financial covenants 
due to the borrowing base limitations and outstanding letters of credit of million  the net amount available for borrowing at february   was million 
the lender may  at its discretion subject to the terms of the line  modify the advance rates used in computing the borrowing base  which may limit the amounts available for future borrowings 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the line as of february   nor were any amounts borrowed during the months ended february   or february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock as follows on january    shares on january    shares on may    shares on september    shares the shares may be repurchased from time to time on the open market  subject to market conditions and other factors  and generally will be funded with internally generated cash

at february    shares had been purchased under the october trading plan 

table of contents we continually review the potential for investments in our growth markets 
in addition  we also evaluate the potential value to shareowners of divesting facilities or other assets that are not performing to our expectations 
the company does not have an active strategy of selling assets  but will consider appropriate opportunities if they will improve shareowner value 
during fiscal  the board of directors authorized management to develop a plan to sell the building at east pratt boulevard in elk grove village  illinois  which is currently a non operating asset 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled plan to sell elk grove village building for further information 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the contractual obligations we have outstanding as of february  in thousands 
contractual obligations obligations due in total less than year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities unrecognized tax benefits total other long term liabilities represent the expected payments for the company s funding requirements for pension and other postretirement benefits 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
unrecognized tax benefits consist of uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the potential future payments 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of february   other than the operating leases presented in the table of contractual obligations 
inflation we believe that general inflation has not had a significant impact on fiscal  or results of operations 
however  as explained below in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  we have experienced fluctuating costs for both raw materials and energy that have had an effect on our gross profit in fiscal  and critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are presented within the notes to the consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies included elsewhere in this form k 
while all of the significant accounting policies affect our consolidated financial statements  some of the policies may be viewed to be critical 
these policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
we base these judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of judgments and estimates form the basis for making judgments about our value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred and the risk of loss has passed to the customer 
this is generally upon shipment of goods to customers  except when shipping terms dictate otherwise 
we record shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are recognized as earned and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also record reductions to revenue for credits issued to customers resulting from scrap credits and manufacturing claims for product defects  based upon historical experience and upon specific claims issues as they arise 
we also record as revenue all sales of scrapped and distressed inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide for an allowance for uncollectible accounts using both specific and general estimates 
we calculate a specific reserve for disputed accounts receivable items by assessing specific receivables that are aged and evaluating the aging of the total receivable pool using both 
table of contents historical data and current knowledge of particular items 
we calculate a general reserve for bankruptcy and insolvency by applying a fixed allowance percentage to the total receivable pool 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was less than million as of february   and february  a increase or decrease in our estimates would result in a negligible change in the allowance 
inventory 
we carry inventory at the lower of cost or market  using either the specific identification or average cost method of cost valuation 
obsolete  damaged and excessive inventories are carried at net realizable value 
historical recovery rates  current market conditions  inventory receipt date and sales plans are key factors used in assessing the net realizable value of obsolete  damaged and excess inventory 
we evaluate the overheads allocated to inventory based upon factory run hours and charge costs related to abnormal under utilization directly against income 
we evaluate our ability to sell inventory and recover costs of inventory through the normal sales process and record lower of cost or market reserves in cases where we cannot 
we evaluate these factors on an interim basis as well as at year end and record adjustments as appropriate to reflect necessary write downs 
there are inherent uncertainties related to determining the recoverability of inventory that may affect our future financial statements as we reevaluate the recoverable amounts during each interim period and year end 
we had inventory reserves of million as of february   net of scrap inventory that can be sold on the secondary market 
long lived assets 
long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on projections of cash flows on a non discounted basis 
if the carrying value of the long lived assets is higher than the undiscounted cash flows related to the asset group  an impairment loss may be necessary 
this loss is measured by the difference between the fair value of the assets and their carrying value 
fair value is determined based on market quotes  if available  or on valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows 
the valuation techniques use certain assumptions we make including  but not limited to  the estimated fair market value of assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as public market data  depreciation factors for orderly liquidation  including allowances such as dismantlement and removal  and the relationship between replacement cost new and market value based on the age of the assets 
during fiscal  we performed an analysis comparing the carrying amount of our long lived assets to projections of undiscounted cash flows  using the process discussed above 
the analysis indicated our long lived assets used in domestic and foreign production were not impaired  but certain r d and corporate assets might be impaired 
we engaged third party valuation consultants to assist us in determining the fair value of these assets as of february  based on the fair values we determined  the asset values were not impaired as of that date and no adjustment was required 
we did not perform an analysis of the carrying amount of our long lived assets during fiscal or  because we did not experience an event or conditions which indicated the carrying amount might be impaired 
we did analyze the carrying amount of certain assets affected by the sale of coil coating assets located in elk grove village in fiscal see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements entitled asset impairment for further discussion of the analysis and results 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences 
these are attributed to the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and tax credit and operating loss carryforwards using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets depends on our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider a number of factors 
these involve all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative income or losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we review the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that our future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in our statement of operations 
we currently believe that we will realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets in the united states and germany  except for net operating losses in certain state jurisdictions  and therefore we have reversed our valuation allowance for us and german deferred tax assets and will maintain our valuation allowance on our certain state net operating losses 

table of contents we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
there are inherent uncertainties related to interpreting tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we transact business 
if judgments and estimates change  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions were million at february  retirement plans 
the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans including the non contributory supplemental pension plans for some of our officers and other postretirement health care plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements entitled retirement and savings plans 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by using a number of assumptions including the discount rate and the estimated future return on plan assets 
to the extent actual amounts differ from these assumptions and estimated amounts  results could be adversely affected 
a one percentage point increase in the estimated discount rate would decrease the net pension expense by less than million and decrease the estimated pension liability by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the net pension expense by less than million and increase the estimated pension liability by million 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the estimated future return on plan assets would have a million relative effect on fiscal net pension expense 
the estimated future return on plan assets for the fiscal pension benefit income calculation is 
environmental reserves 
we are a party to various legal proceedings in connection with the remediation of certain environmental matters 
we record these environmental reserves based on historical experience and the extent of relevant information available from various third parties 
a number of assumptions are made including  without limitation  the estimated extent of the environmental damage to any particular site  the available methods of remedy  the contribution expected from various other potentially responsible parties and the discretionary authority of federal and state regulatory authorities in bringing enforcement actions 
we believe our exposure for these proceedings and known sites is approximately million 
as of february   the company has approximately million in its environmental reserves 
accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb issued asu  which revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options in asc and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income oci 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
for public entities  the asu s amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance  which may result in changes in the presentation of its financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally in europe  china  japan and malaysia  have a joint venture in brazil  and have a production agreement with a company in korea 
this means we are subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates 
for the years ended february   and february   foreign sales were approximately and of consolidated net sales  respectively 
historically  the effect of movements in the exchange rates has not been material to our financial position or our results of operations 
we believe the movement in foreign currency exchange rates will not have a material adverse effect on our financial statements 
we had a million line of credit at the lender s prime rate of interest on february  or at libor plus 
there was no debt outstanding as of february   although we did have million in outstanding letters of credit at that date
