item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and the information contained elsewhere in this form k under the captions risk factors  selected financial data  and business 
overview we are a leading developer  marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel  footwear and accessories 
the brand s moisture wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products 
our products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels  from youth to professional  on playing fields around the globe  as well as by consumers with active lifestyles 

table of contents our net revenues grew to  million in from million in we believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the under armour brand in the marketplace 
we plan to continue to increase our net revenues over the long term by increased sales of our apparel  footwear and accessories  expansion of our wholesale distribution sales channel  growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets 
our direct to consumer sales channel includes our factory house and specialty stores and websites 
new offerings for include hats and bags  as well as charged cotton products 
our products are currently offered in approximately twenty five thousand retail stores worldwide 
a large majority of our products are sold in north america  however  we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe 
outside of north america  our products are offered primarily in austria  france  germany  ireland and the united kingdom  as well as in japan through a licensee  and through distributors located in other foreign countries 
we hold a minority investment in our licensee in japan 
our operating segments are geographic and include north america  latin america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  and asia 
due to the insignificance of the emea  latin america and asia operating segments  they have been combined into other foreign countries for disclosure purposes 
we believe there is an increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle 
we believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products 
we also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non performance products to our performance products  which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin  helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort 
we believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and lifestyles are not unique to the united states  but are occurring in a number of markets globally  thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers 
although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth  we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take advantage of these opportunities  including  among others  the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers 
in addition  we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and a more complex business 
we may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products that meet changing preferences in a timely manner 
furthermore  our industry is very competitive  and competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability 
we also rely on third party suppliers and manufacturers outside the us to provide fabrics and to produce our products  and disruptions to our supply chain could harm our business 
for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business  refer to the risk factors section included in item a

table of contents oil 
in general  as a percentage of net revenues  we expect cost of goods sold associated with our apparel and accessories to be lower than that of our footwear 
no cost of goods sold is associated with license revenues 
we include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold  however  we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold

refer above and to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the assumed loan and term loan 
a million deposit was paid upon signing the purchase agreement in november the aggregate fair value of the acquisition was million 
the fair value was estimated using a combination of market  income and cost approaches 
the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination  and as such we recognized a bargain purchase gain of million as the amount by which the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the fair value of the purchase price 
in connection with this acquisition  we incurred acquisition related expenses of approximately million 
both the acquisition related expenses and pre tax bargain purchase gain were included in selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income during the year ended december  this transaction is not expected to have a material impact to our consolidated statements of income in future periods 

table of contents we believe that we were able to negotiate the acquisition of the net assets for less than fair value because the seller marketed the property in a limited manner  and thus the property did not have adequate exposure to the market prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for real estate transactions

the amounts listed for product purchase obligations primarily represent our open production purchase orders for our apparel  footwear and accessories  including expected inbound freight  duties and other costs 
these open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable prices 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of december  when compared to the product purchase obligation included in our form k  product purchase obligations have decreased by primarily due to the timing of product purchases and improvements in inventory management

some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products 
the amount of product provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate and our decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
in addition  it is not possible to determine the amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based variables 
the amounts listed above are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these agreements 

table of contents the table above excludes a liability of million for uncertain tax positions  including the related interest and penalties  recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items 
generally  such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent  engage in willful misconduct  or act in bad faith 
based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition net revenues consist of both net sales and license revenues 
net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership  including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods 
transfer of title and risk of loss are based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
in some instances  transfer of title and risk of loss take place at the point of sale  for example at our retail stores 
we may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
license revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees 
sales taxes imposed on our revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis on the consolidated statements of income and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns  markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances  which is inherently uncertain  may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established  we would record a reduction or increase  as appropriate  to net sales in the period in which we make such a determination 
provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers 
reserves for returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices 
as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively  in reserves for customer returns  allowances  markdowns and discounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments 
table of contents within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a benefit or charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory valuation and reserves we value our inventory at standard cost which approximates our landed cost  using the first in  first out method of cost determination 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory  we record a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  further adjustments may be required that would increase our cost of goods sold in the period in which we make such a determination 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated cash flows 
when factors indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we review long lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows 
impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
no material impairments were recorded in the years ended december   and income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary 
assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment 
we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized  valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets  which increase income tax expense in the period when such a determination is made 
income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
settlements with tax authorities  the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions  or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized 
table of contents compensation expense  excluding performance based equity awards  expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of december   we had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to performance based stock options expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based compensation awards  stock price volatility and estimated forfeiture rates 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation awards represent management s best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  compensation expense for performance based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable  which requires management judgment 
for example  the achievement of the operating income targets related to the performance based restricted stock units granted in were not deemed probable as of december  additional stock based compensation of up to million would have been recorded in for these performance based restricted stock units had the full achievement of these operating targets been deemed probable 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
refer to note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update which eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
it requires an entity to present total comprehensive income  which includes the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income  either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to this pronouncement which defers the specific requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement 
these pronouncements are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we believe the adoption of these pronouncements will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued an accounting standards update which clarifies the requirements for how to measure fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements common to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and international financial reporting standards 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange and foreign currency risk management and derivatives we currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in canada and europe 
the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar 
to date  net revenues generated outside of the united states have not been significant 
however  as our net revenues generated outside of the united states increase  our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies as we currently do in canada and europe and if the us dollar strengthens  it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the us dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements 
in addition  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies 
these gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions 
these exposures are included in other expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents from time to time  we may elect to use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk from exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and projected inventory purchases for our european and canadian subsidiaries 
in addition  we may elect to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling denominated balance sheet items 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of december   we receive us dollars in exchange for canadian dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of cad per  us dollars in exchange for euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of per and euros in exchange for pounds sterling at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of per 
as of december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our canadian subsidiary was million with contract maturities of month or less  and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our european subsidiary was million with contract maturities of month 
as of december   the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contract used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on pound sterling denominated balance sheet items was million  or million  with a contract maturity of month 
the foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges  and accordingly  changes in their fair value are recorded in other expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
the fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of million and million as of december  and  respectively  and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the fair value measurements 
included in other expense  net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts year ended december  in thousands unrealized foreign currency exchange rate gains losses realized foreign currency exchange rate gains losses unrealized derivative losses realized derivative gains losses we enter into foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and are exposed to credit losses in the event of non performance by these financial institutions 
this credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts 
however  we monitor the credit quality of these financial institutions and consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal 
although we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows  we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
inflation inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
although we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs
