item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth above under the caption risk factors 
you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements for the year ended december  and the related notes appearing in part ii item of this report 
overview we are a medical device company focused on the commercialization of our flagship product  melafind  and the further design and development of melafind and our technology 
melafind is a non invasive  point of care instrument to aid in the detection of melanoma 
melafind  features a hand held component that emits multiple wavelengths of light to capture digital data from clinically atypical pigmented skin lesions 
prior to the commercial launch of melafind commencing in the first quarter of  the company had not generated any revenues from melafind 
all of our historical revenues have come from activities and products that have since been discontinued 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
the melafind pre market approval pma application was submitted to the us food and drug administration fda in june  and had been granted expedited review by the fda 
a pivotal trial conducted to establish the safety and effectiveness of melafind was performed under the auspices of a binding protocol agreement and all study end points were met 
the results of the pivotal study were published in the archives of dermatology in october on line and february print 
the pma application for melafind was reviewed by the fda s general and plastic surgery devices panel panel in november the panel voted favorably on all three questions posed by the fda 
in february  the company submitted a pma amendment containing a revised indications for use statement limiting melafind to use by dermatologists  based on discussions that ensued during the panel meeting 
in may  the company filed a second pma amendment containing a training program for clinicians  an outline of which was presented at the panel meeting 
the company received written approval from the fda for the melafind pma application on november  as a condition of pma approval  the company committed to conduct a post approval study pas evaluating the sensitivity of physicians in diagnosing melanomas and high grade lesions and the false positive rate after using melafind 
in august  the company received the international organization for standardization iso certification of the company s comprehensive management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices 
in september  the company received conformite europeenne ce mark approval for melafind 
with ce mark approval  the company has the ability to market melafind to dermatologists across the european union and in certain other countries 
on march   the company installed the first commercial melafind systems  and intends to continue with a controlled launch of melafind in selected us and european markets 
our revenue for the foreseeable future will depend on the success of commercialization of melafind  and may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
our operating expenses may also vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter in support of the commercialization of melafind 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of our future performance 

table of contents we commenced operations in december as a new york corporation and re incorporated as a delaware corporation in september since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the commercialization of melafind 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations for at least the next twelve months 
the timing and amount of any additional funding the company may require to broaden the commercial expansion of melafind will be affected by the commercial success of the product 
the funding could be in the form of either additional equity or debt financing 
most of our expenditures to date have been for research and development activities and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product development  clinical trials and activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
our research and development expenses incurred for the year ended december  were related primarily to the development of melafind and review of the melafind pma by the fda 
we expect to continue to incur certain additional research and development expenses relating to melafind 
additional r d charges may be incurred for complementary technologies 
these additional expenses could exceed our estimated amounts  possibly materially 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related human resources expenses  legal expenses  including litigation expenses and general corporate activities and costs associated with our efforts toward development of a commercial infrastructure to market and sell melafind 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we build our sales and marketing capabilities to support placing melafind systems in selected markets inside and outside the us at december   we had available income tax benefit from net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax reporting purposes of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income expiring at various dates through the year the company s ability to utilize its net operating losses may be significantly limited due to future changes in the company s ownership as defined by federal income tax regulations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our judgments related to accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates relating to revenue recognition  stock based compensation charges  and accrued expenses are most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 

table of contents revenue recognition the company considers revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company s agreements with dermatologists regarding the melafind system combines the elements noted above with a future service obligation 
while the company is required to place the melafind system with dermatologists for their exclusive use  ownership of the melafind system remains with the company 
the company generates revenue primarily from the sale of single use electronic record cards 
these cards activate the melafind system  capture digital data and store the data for each patient visit 
in addition  the company charges an initial installation fee for each melafind system which covers training  delivery and supplies 
in accordance with the accounting guidance regarding multiple element arrangements  the company defers revenue for the undelivered service element based upon the relative standalone selling prices  and recognizes the associated revenue over the related service period  generally expected to be two years 
prior to the installation of the first commercial melafind system in the first quarter of  the company had no revenues from products since when it discontinued its difoti operations 
stock based compensation we account for non employee stock based awards in which goods or services are the consideration received for the equity instruments issued based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance with fasb asc  equity based payments to non employees 
we record compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
a compensation charge is recorded  when it is probable that performance conditions will be satisfied  over the period estimated to satisfy the performance condition 
the probability of vesting is updated at each reporting period and compensation is adjusted prospectively 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include professional service fees  contract clinical and regulatory related service fees  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of melafind components or materials  and fees paid to third party data collection organizations and investigators in conjunction with the clinical trials and fda and other regulatory review 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our projections of the timing of services provided relative to the actual level of services provided by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often 
table of contents subjective determinations 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us and accrue for such costs in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
this is done as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements

table of contents operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we face certain risks and uncertainties  which are present in many emerging medical device companies 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we proceed with the melafind commercialization process and expand our corporate infrastructure 
we do not expect to generate significant product revenue until after we successfully complete a controlled product launch of melafind 
however  we will need substantial funds to broaden the commercial expansion of melafind  including development of a direct sales force and expansion of our contract manufacturing capacity 
the timing and amount of any additional funding the company may require will be affected by the commercial success of the product 
the funding could be in the form of either additional equity or debt financing 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  if our existing cash is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility  which will be even more difficult due to the lack of available capital as a result of the recent global economic crisis 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities would have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of planned product research development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of medical devices such as melafind and operating our company  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the cost of commercialization activities  including product marketing and building a domestic direct sales force  the amount of direct payments we are able to obtain from physicians utilizing melafind  the costs of maintaining regulatory approval  reimbursement amounts for the use of melafind that we are able to obtain from medicare and third party payers  the success of our research and development efforts in product creation and enhancement  and meeting competitive services and technologies  the schedule  costs  and results of our clinical trials  the costs of maintaining or potentially building our inventory and other manufacturing expenses  our ability to establish and maintain any collaborative  licensing or other arrangements  and the terms and timing of any such arrangements 
the costs involved in defending any patent infringement actions or other litigation claims brought against us by third parties  and the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims or other rights

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

table of contents recently adopted accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amends subtopic asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
this guidance  which enables vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit  addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  and how to allocate the consideration to each unit of accounting 
in an arrangement with multiple deliverables  the delivered item s shall be considered a separate unit of accounting if the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items have value on a stand alone basis if they are sold separately by any vendor or the customer could resell the delivered items on a stand alone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
the company s future revenue recognition will be modeled to conform to the requirements outlined in this guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk at december  is confined to our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest in cash and money market accounts with commercial banks 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
while declines in interest rates do impact the amount of interest income that our cash and cash equivalents will earn  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments  due to the nature of our accounts
