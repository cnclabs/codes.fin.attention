table of contents critical accounting estimates disclosure of codorus valley s significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
some of these policies require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses  valuation of foreclosed real estate  and evaluation of other than temporary impairment losses of securities 
management considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  financial and managerial strength of borrowers  adequacy of collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
appraisals are generally used to determine fair value 
after foreclosure  management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent and impaired loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition 
the corporation records its available for sale securities portfolio at fair value 
fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  and as clarified by several fasb staff positions 
fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exists 
debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers whether the corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity 
often  information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
management discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management discussion and analysis disclosure with the audit committee 
there were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report 
additional information is contained in management s discussion and analysis regarding critical accounting estimates  including the provision and allowance for loan losses  located on pages and of this report 

table of contents overview executive summary as we continue to be challenged by current economic conditions  we were able to achieve several notable accomplishments for the current year  which included expansion of the banking franchise through the addition of our eighteenth financial center in the westminster area of carroll county  maryland  the addition of tier capital  ie  preferred stock  through participation in the us department of the treasury s treasury small business lending fund program  which we will continue to leverage by making loans to creditworthy businesses and  as a result  lower the dividend rate on the preferred stock issued under this program  the redemption of all outstanding preferred stock and related stock warrants issued to the treasury under its capital purchase program  an increase in annual cash dividends from per common share to per common share  progression with the implementation of a companywide client relationship management system  internally branded as bravo  with expected completion in  and continued balance sheet growth whereby the corporation exceeded billion in total assets  enabling it to benefit from economies of scale 
while earnings showed improvement for the year  particularly the million earned in the fourth quarter  which was our best ever quarter  earnings remained constrained due to credit quality issues 
for the third consecutive year  the provision for loan losses remained elevated compared to historical losses in response to the upward trend in net charge offs 
over this three year time period  a relatively high level of carrying costs and losses on impaired loans and foreclosed real estate also served to dampen earnings  most of these costs and losses resulted from approximately twelve commercial loan relationships 
during  the demand for commercial loans increased above the year  as the corporation gained market share from its rivals 
with the exception of residential mortgage refinances  which took advantage of historically low market interest rates  there was little demand for consumer loans 
we believe that the high level of unemployment and underemployment that prevailed during  along with declines in housing prices  continued to depress demand for these kinds of loans 
total deposits increased during  particularly core deposits  ie  deposits other then certificates of deposit  but at a slower pace then in previous years as household cash flow was used for rising food and energy costs and to pay down debt 
during  noninterest income  principally income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales  decreased due to the resignation of four registered representatives who left codorus valley financial advisors  a subsidiary of peoplesbank  in february the decrease in revenue was largely offset by a decrease in operating expense  principally personnel costs 
noninterest income was also adversely impacted by fdic restrictions pertaining to automated overdraft payment programs  which is discussed within the noninterest income section of this report 
further  price restrictions imposed by the federal government under the durbin interchange amendment may adversely affect debit card revenue in future periods even though this legislation is intended for larger banks 
increasing noninterest or fee based income by offering new services  enhancing traditional services and expanding sales into new geographic markets is an important financial strategy 
however  achievement of this strategy has become more challenging to attain as a result of pricing restrictions imposed by the federal government 
in the periods ahead  we will remain focused on profitable balance sheet growth  acquiring and nurturing client relationships  instilling a client centric culture ie  bravo  risk management and possible expansion of the banking franchise 
we anticipate a continuation of economic weakness  both nationally and locally  through and possibly beyond 
risks and uncertainties include prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions  which could increase credit related losses  possible declines in the market value of investment securities considered to be other than temporary  a relatively high level of unemployment  erosion of real estate values and possible adverse economic impacts caused by global events 

table of contents financial highlights vs 
the corporation earned net income available to common shareholders earnings of  or per share  diluted  for the year  compared to  or per share  basic and diluted  for the year the  or percent increase in annual earnings for the year  compared to the year was the result of an increase in net interest income and a decrease in total noninterest expense  which more than offset a decrease in noninterest income and increases in the provision for loan losses  the provision for income taxes and preferred stock dividends and discount accretion 
the  or percent increase in net interest income for resulted primarily from a larger volume of earning assets  principally commercial loans and investment securities  and a decrease in funding costs 
the decrease in funding costs resulted from a lower volume of borrowings  a larger proportion of low cost core deposits to total deposits and lower rates generally paid on all deposit products  which reflected unusually low market interest rates 
net interest income tax equivalent basis as a percentage of interest earning assets  ie  net interest margin  was percent for the year  compared to percent for the year the  or percent increase in the provision for loan losses for the year reflected an increase in losses on various commercial loan relationships 
during september  the corporation recorded losses totaling  on two unrelated commercial loan relationships which it disclosed in a form k filed on october   as amended by form k a filed on november  the provision for both periods remained elevated in comparison to the corporation s historic levels and was reflective of the risks and uncertainties associated with prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions  a relatively high level of unemployment and erosion of real estate values

the provision for income tax expense for the year increased  or percent due primarily to the percent increase in the level of income before income taxes 
the  or percent increase in preferred stock dividends and discount accretion for the year was primarily attributable to a non recurring  transaction to remove unamortized discount caused by the redemption of all outstanding preferred stock issued to the us department of the treasury treasury under its capital purchase program

the  or percent increase in net interest income for was the result of an increase in earning assets and a decrease in the average rates paid on deposit products  which reflected record low short term market interest rates 
an increase in the yield on floating rate commercial loans  due to the imposition of a minimum rate that was instituted in the prior year  also contributed to the increase in net interest income 
these factors improved the net interest margin  which was percent for  compared to percent for

a more detailed analysis of the factors and trends affecting earnings follows 

table of contents income statement analysis net interest income the corporation s principal source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities  and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in net interest income are caused by changes in interest rates  volumes and the composition or mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
unless otherwise noted  the discussion that follows is based on interest income and interest expense as reported in the consolidated statements of income  not on a tax equivalent basis 
net interest income for was  an increase of  or percent above the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average volume of interest earning assets  a decrease in the average volume of long term debt and a decrease in the average rate paid on deposits 
net interest income tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average interest earning assets  ie  net interest margin  was percent for  compared to percent for interest earning assets averaged million and yielded percent tax equivalent basis for the current period  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in average interest earning assets was due primarily to an increase in investment securities and secondarily to an increase in commercial loans 
the increase in the average volume of earning assets more than offset the decrease in the average yield  which reflected the low level of market interest rates 
total interest bearing liabilities averaged million at an average rate of percent for  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in average interest bearing liabilities reflected growth in all deposit categories  which more than offset a decrease in long term debt 
interest expense on deposits for was million or percent below as the favorable impact of low product rates and deposit mix largely offset the effect of the increase in average volume 
interest expense on long term debt decreased for  compared to  due primarily to volume as maturing federal home loan bank loans  with relatively high interest rates  were selectively not refinanced 
comparatively  for  net interest income was  an increase of  or percent above the increase was primarily the result of an increase in the average volume of interest earnings assets and a decrease in the average rates paid on deposit products  which reflected low short term market interest rates 
an increase in yield on floating rate commercial loans  due to the imposition of a minimum rate that began in  also contributed 
these factors improved the net interest margin for  which was percent  compared to percent for for  total interest income increased  or percent  above due primarily to an increase in the average volume of earning assets and the increase in yield on floating rate commercial loans as described earlier 
earning assets averaged million and yielded percent tax equivalent basis for  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in the average volume of earning assets was primarily the result of increases in investment securities and to a lesser degree  commercial loans 
with the exception of mortgage refinancing  the demand for commercial and consumer loans diminished in in response to the prolonged economic slowdown  depressed real estate markets and the high rate of unemployment and job insecurity 

table of contents for  total interest expense decreased  or percent  below the level due to a decrease in the average rates paid on deposits 
total interest bearing liabilities averaged million at an average rate of percent  compared to million and percent  respectively  for the million or percent increase in average interest bearing liabilities was primarily the result of increases in the average volume of money market and time deposits 
deposit growth reflected our competitive rates and customer preference for the liquidity and safety of fdic insured deposit products

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is an expense charged to earnings to cover estimated losses attributable to uncollectible loans 
the provision reflects management s judgment of an appropriate level for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the risk management section of this report  including tables nonperforming assets  analysis of allowance for loan and lease losses  and allocation of allowance for loan and lease losses  provides detailed information about the allowance  provision and credit risk

these factors can adversely affect our borrowers ability to service their loans 

table of contents noninterest income the following table presents the components of total noninterest income for each of the past three years 
table noninterest income dollars in thousands trust and investment services fees income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales service charges on deposit accounts income from bank owned life insurance other income gain on sales of loans held for sale gain on sales of securities total noninterest income for  the overall  or percent decrease in total noninterest income  compared to  was primarily the result of the decrease in income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales as explained below 
the discussion that follows addresses changes in selected categories of noninterest income 
trust and investment services fees increases in this category of noninterest income for and were primarily the result of appreciation in market value of managed accounts  upon which some fees are based  and growth in the settlement advisory business 
income from mutual fund  annuity and insurance sales for  the  or percent decrease in income from the sale of mutual funds  annuities and insurance products by codorus valley financial advisors cvfa  a subsidiary of peoplesbank  was a result of the resignation of four registered representatives who left cvfa in february the decrease in revenue was largely offset by a decrease in operating expense  principally personnel costs 
accordingly  the net impact on cvfa s earnings was immaterial 
for  the  or percent increase in income  compared to  was due primarily to increases in income from brokerage and advisory service product lines  which were driven by market value appreciation  upon which some fees are based  and increased sales 
service charges on deposit accounts increases in service charge income for and were primarily the result of an increase in debit card revenue  which reflected an increase in the volume of transactions 
the increase in debit card revenue for the year helped to offset the decrease in overdraft fees as reported below 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued final guidance in november for automated overdraft payment programs 
this guidance  effective july   recommended that financial institutions establish policies that  among other things  limit the number of daily overdraft fees per customer  set a de minimis limit whereby small dollar transactions that overdraw an account are not charged an overdraft fee  and to take meaningful steps to counsel customers that have more than six overdrafts in a rolling twelve month period about less costly alternatives to overdraft protection 
implementation of the fdic guidance lowered overdraft fees on consumer households by approximately  or percent during the six months that it was effective for  compared to 
table of contents price restrictions imposed by the federal government under the durbin interchange amendment may significantly reduce debit card revenue  ie  interchange fees  for peoplesbank in future periods 
while the legislation targeted larger banks with total assets of billion on more  market forces in the future may not make a distinction between large and small banks 
income from bank owned life insurance boli income from boli for the three years presented was basically flat as low market interest rates depressed yields 
this investment provides a competitive tax free return to the corporation while providing a life insurance benefit to the management team 
other income other income  comprised of many underlying fees  increased slightly as a result of normal business growth over the three year period presented 
this category includes wire transfer fees  credit card merchant fees  automated teller machine fees  safe deposit box fees and miscellaneous fees  among others 
gain on sales of loans held for sale the decrease in gains from the sale of loans for the three years presented was due primarily to a decrease in the volume of mortgage loan sales 
for  a decrease in pricing from secondary market sources also contributed to the decrease in gains 
sales in were unusually high due to a full year s favorable impact of the federal government s first time home buyer tax credit program that expired in april in spite of low market interest rates  mortgage loan activity is expected to remain subdued  resulting from a decline in refinancing as it reaches a level of saturation  the inability of some borrowers to qualify for loans or to sell their existing homes and the high level of unemployment 
gain on sales of securities gains from the sale of fixed income securities from the available for sale securities portfolio are recognized periodically to take advantage of a low market interest rate environment and to supplement earnings 
the sale of securities is also a tactic to improve portfolio performance whereby underperforming securities are sold and replaced with securities that have a more favorable profile with regard to risk vs

noninterest expense the following table presents the components of total noninterest expense for each of the past three years 
table noninterest expense dollars in thousands personnel occupancy of premises  net furniture and equipment postage  stationery and supplies professional and legal marketing and advertising fdic insurance debit card processing charitable donations telephone foreclosed real estate including gains losses on sales impaired loan carrying costs other total noninterest expense 
table of contents total noninterest expense for decreased  or percent below due primarily to a decrease in costs associated with foreclosed real estate and impaired loans 
the discussion that follows addresses changes in selected noninterest expense categories 
personnel personnel expense is comprised of wages  sales commissions  payroll taxes and employee benefits 
the  or percent increase in personnel expense for  compared to  was attributable to an increase in the wage expense component  which reflected normal business growth and additions to staff associated with the new financial center located in westminster  maryland  which opened for business in september of staff additions associated with private banking and regulatory compliance also contributed to the increase in wage expense 
generally  the cost of staff additions more than offset the cost savings of the aforementioned resignation of four registered representatives who left peoplesbank subsidiary codorus valley financial advisors in february comparatively  the increase of  or percent for the year  compared to  resulted primarily from an increase in employee health care insurance costs and normal business growth 
effective august   peoplesbank converted from a fully insured health care program to a self insured program by joining a consortium of approximately banks 
for the first year under the new program  peoplesbank funded the maximum liability based on claims experience  which resulted in an increase in health care costs 
thereafter  the benefits of the self insured program are expected to contain future health care cost increases over the long term 
employees have customarily reimbursed the corporation for approximately percent of the cost of health insurance 
a non recurring cost of  in the first quarter of incurred to restructure employee benefit plans also contributed to the level of personnel expense 
however  restructuring the benefit plans resulted in a federal income tax benefit so that the overall transaction had an insignificant impact on net income for occupancy of premises  net occupancy of premises expense is comprised of rent  depreciation  maintenance  insurance  real estate taxes and utilities 
the upward trend in this expense category reflects normal business growth  including the addition of a branch banking office in and the relocation of an existing branch banking office during to a more favorable site 
furniture and equipment the increase in furniture and equipment expense for year was  or percent above due to normal business growth and price increases for computer software maintenance contracts 
during the third quarter of  peoplesbank began implementing a client relationship management crm system with estimated completion in the capital outlay for this project is estimated at  which does not include staffing and other ancillary expenses 
when the system becomes operational in it will be depreciated over a five year useful life 
a properly managed crm process is expected to improve the corporation s competitiveness and client service and retention 
postage  stationery and supplies the upward trend in this expense category reflects normal business growth  increases in postal rates  required compliance correspondence and promotional advertisements 
professional and legal expense for the three years presented shows an upward trend that reflects  in part  normal business growth 
the  or percent increase for  compared to  includes an increase in legal fees to defend peoplesbank against routine lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
marketing and advertising expense for the three years presented shows an upward trend that reflects an increased operating budget to support normal business growth and increased corporate initiatives such as branding  product advertising and internal promotions 

table of contents fdic insurance the  or percent decrease in fdic insurance premiums for  compared to  was the result of a change by the fdic in its assessment methodology 
effective april   the fdic lowered assessment rates and applied them against average assets minus average tangible capital  instead of domestic deposits 
more information about fdic insurance assessments is available under the supervision and regulation section of this report reference the subheading fdic 
the  or percent decrease in insurance premiums for  compared to  was primarily the result of a special assessment imposed on all banks by the fdic in to provide a temporary means of funding its deposit insurance fund  which was depleted at the time 
the special assessment for the year for peoplesbank totaled  debit card processing annual increases in debit card processing expense were primarily the result of increases in the number of new accounts and transaction volume 
this expense category also includes the cost of operating automated teller machines 
charitable donations the level of charitable donations  principally educational and scholarship donations  is based  in part  upon whether or not peoplesbank can obtain related state tax credits if available from nonprofit organizations 
accordingly  the level of charitable donations can vary from year to year 
for example  the decrease in charitable donations for resulted from the denial or delay of tax credits by the state of pennsylvania for educational donations due to budgetary constraints 
peoplesbank uses state tax credits from donations to reduce its pennsylvania shares tax expense  included below in other expenses 
foreclosed real estate including gains losses on sales foreclosed real estate costs remained elevated for and due to the level of carrying costs and impairment losses from deterioration of property values associated with specific properties as well as the size of the portfolio  which was reflective of prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions and the erosion of real estate values 
typical carrying costs include insurance  maintenance and repairs  real estate taxes  appraisals and legal fees 
costs for the year decreased by  or percent due to the recognition of additional rental income totaling  from a real estate project and a decrease in the provision for real estate losses 
for the year  the provision for real estate losses totaled  compared to  for impaired loan carrying costs the prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions may cause fluctuations in impaired loan carrying costs 
factors such as the number and size of the loans in the impaired loan portfolio  financial capacity of the borrower or guarantor  value and liquidity of underlying collateral and the timing of when and for how long loans are classified as impaired  among other factors  contribute to the variability of this expense from period to period 
carrying costs are the same as those described for foreclosed real estate 
other the annual variability of other expense  which is comprised of many underlying expenses  was due in part to varying levels of pennsylvania shares tax expense  which reflected the varying level of state tax credits that originated from an increase of charitable donations as described above 
for example  shares tax  net of credits  totaled  for  compared to  for the tax for year was larger due primarily to a decrease in the level of state tax credits and secondarily to an increase in the taxable equity base 
the increase in other expense for also reflected normal business growth 

table of contents income taxes the provision for income tax for year was  compared to a  for the increase in income tax was primarily the result of an increase in pretax income 
for both periods  the corporation s statutory federal income tax rate was percent 
the corporation s effective income tax rate was approximately percent for  compared to percent for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate due to the impact of low income housing credits and tax exempt income  including income from bank owned life insurance 
balance sheet review overnight investments overnight investments  comprised of interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold  totaled million on december   compared to million on december  the level of overnight investment at year end decreased as investable funds were deployed to higher yielding commercial loan and investment securities portfolios 
securities  available for sale the investment securities portfolio is an interest earning asset  second in size to the loan portfolio 
investment securities serve as an important source of revenue and liquidity 
they also serve as collateral for public and trust deposits  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and to support borrowings 
the investment securities portfolio is managed to comply with the corporation s investment securities policy  and accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic decisions to purchase or sell securities are based on an assessment of current economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  the demand for loans  and liquidity and income requirements

the leverage strategy  which was completed in april  generated an approximately two percent tax equivalent margin spread  which covered the dividends payable and related costs associated with the issuance of preferred stock described in the shareholders equity and capital adequacy section of this report 

table of contents during and  peoplesbank took advantage of the low interest rate environment and sold selected securities  which generated net gains of  and  respectively  that were recognized in income 
included in the net gains for was an  loss associated with the sale of eleven municipal bonds totaling approximately million par value that no longer met the corporation s investment standards 
included in the gain for was a small gain from the sale of the corporation s remaining million par value corporate trust preferred security  which represented an obligation of the bank of america 
securities  available for sale are generally comprised of high quality debt instruments 
included in table are investments in the obligations of states and municipalities 
during the fourth quarter of bonds issued by states and municipalities received negative national press because of widespread budget deficits and  by implication  the possibility of default 
we believe that selected investment in municipal bonds is a sound investment practice 
municipalities have many options for meeting their debt obligations  including decreasing costs and service levels  imposing taxes and selling assets 
in many cases  municipal debt issues are insured or  in the case of school districts of selected states  backed by specific reserves  which provide a layer of protection to the investor 
access to the credit market and a good credit rating are high priorities of municipal management enabling it to meet its current and future funding needs at a reasonable interest cost 
for these reasons  defaults on municipal bonds are very low  well below percent 
with the exception of an approximately million portfolio fair value of texas municipal utility district bonds  which has its own criteria for investment  the remaining municipal bonds are almost all rated a or above by at least one national rating service at december  the majority of bonds in our portfolio are general obligation bonds  which can draw upon multiple sources of revenue  including taxes  for payment 
only a few bonds are revenue bonds  which are dependent upon a single revenue stream for payment  but they are for critical services such as water and sewer 
many of the municipal holdings are also insured or backed by specific school district reserves

capital ratios the corporation and peoplesbank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators that involve quantitative guidelines and qualitative judgments 
quantitative measures established by regulators pertain to minimum capital ratios  as set forth in table the table provides a comparison of the corporation s and peoplesbank s risk based capital ratios and leverage ratios to the minimum regulatory requirement for the periods indicated 

table of contents risk management the corporation s risk management committee committee meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and an independent director 
the objective of the committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the corporation and its affiliates 
while the committee s risk review is broad in scope  its primary responsibility is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a loan client  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms  posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the corporation 
accordingly  the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes seven basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre established dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern central maryland 
although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers lessens this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
sixth  the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market  nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages 
and seventh  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein

table of contents the corporation uses loan to value ratios ltv ratios  establishing generally acceptable ratios of the loan amount to the value of the collateral securing the loan  to minimize the risk of loss from the loan portfolio 
at december   the ltv ratios listed below were in effect 
loan type ltv ratio residential  owner occupied units  tax assessment md residential  owner occupied units  tax assessment york  pa residential  owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  non owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  or more units agricultural commercial industrial vacant land depending on improvements  approvals special limited use properties an acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans 
generally  an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans where the amount is above  or is non owner occupied  or if the ltv ratio is above percent for commercial property or above the limits shown in the above schedule for valuations based on tax assessments for owner occupied residential property  or if an existing appraisal is more than one year old 
exceptions to ltv ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management or the board of directors when there are compensating factors 
one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
at year end and  the corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio builder developer were of the portfolio at december  and  respectively  and commercial real estate investor was and percent of the portfolio  respectively 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate 
in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
loan portfolios are also reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 
nonperforming assets the following table presents a five year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios 
we generally place a loan on nonaccrual status and cease accruing interest income  ie  recognize interest income on a cash basis as long as the loan is sufficiently collateralized  when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest represent loans that are contractually past due  but are well collateralized and in the process of collection 
foreclosed real estate represents real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to peoplesbank 
the final category  troubled debt restructurings  pertains to loans whose terms have been modified to include a concession that we would not ordinarily consider due to the debtor s financial difficulties 
concessions granted under a troubled debt restructuring typically involve a reduction of interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk  the deferral of payments or extension of the stated maturity date 
troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment if they have been restructured during the most recent calendar year  or if they cease to perform in accordance with the modified terms 
the paragraphs below explain significant changes in the aforementioned categories for december   compared to december  
table of contents nonperforming assets are reviewed by management on a monthly basis 
we generally rely on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of collateral for impaired collateral dependent loans 
generally  an appraisal is performed when an account reaches days past due  unless a certified appraisal was completed within the past six months  market values have changed significantly  the condition of the property has changed significantly  or the existing appraisal is outdated 
in instances where the value of the collateral is less than the net carrying amount of the loan  a specific loss allowance is established for the difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement 
when it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected  that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance 
generally  a loan is returned to interest accruing status when we determine that circumstances have improved to the extent that all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are current for at least six consecutive payments and future payments are reasonably assured

table of contents nonaccrual loans on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled  and was comprised primarily of collateralized commercial loans 
comparatively  nonaccrual loans totaled  at year end the decrease in nonaccrual loans reflected the reclassification of a  loan to performing status disclosed in a form k previously filed on october   reclassification to the foreclosed real estate portfolio  loan charge offs and payments by borrowers  which more than offset nonaccrual loan additions  principally loan numbers and  described below 
on december   the nonaccrual loan portfolio was comprised of sixteen unrelated loan relationships with outstanding principal balances ranging in size from  to  four unrelated commercial relationships  which represent percent of the total nonaccrual loan portfolio balance  are described below 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly and have established a loss allowance for selected loan relationships where the net realizable value of the collateral is insufficient to repay the loan 
in this regard allowances  if applicable  are noted below within the description of the loan 
collection efforts  including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts based on prevailing market conditions and liquidation of collateral assets  are being employed to maximize recovery 
further provisions for loan losses may be required for nonaccrual loans as additional information becomes available or conditions change or as required by bank regulators 
loan no 
the outstanding principal balance of the loan relationship is  this account is collateralized by three acres of improved real estate located in a major commercial district  a small parcel of improved real estate and the assignment of a personal loan from a third party whose payments are current 
based on recent appraisals of the real estate  we believe that the loan is adequately collateralized 
the borrower is presently operating under a troubled debt restructuring

peoplesbank owns a percent participation interest in this loan relationship 
the carrying value of the bank s principal at december   was  which reflected two partial charge offs in september totaling  due to deterioration in value as reported on form k filed on october   charge off  and on form k a filed on november   charge off 
the latter charge off reflected the results of a public auction held november  of real estate collateral supporting the loan 
the collateral originally supporting this out of market loan was a acre parcel of improved real estate that has been subdivided and zoned commercial use 
additionally  there is other collateral that can be liquidated to maximize recovery

for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately  the amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for was approximately  the interest income recognized on impaired loans  which includes nonaccrual loans  in note loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  is a lesser amount because it includes interest income only from the time the loan was impaired 

table of contents foreclosed real estate on december   foreclosed real estate  net of allowance  totaled  compared to  at december  the increase was due primarily to the significant capital improvements made to property no 
 identified below  and the addition of properties no

on december   the portfolio was comprised of nine unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  which we are actively attempting to liquidate 
if a valuation allowance for probable loss was established for a particular property it is so noted in the property description below 
further valuation allowances may be required on any foreclosed property as additional information becomes available or conditions change 
foreclosed real estate is included in the other assets category on the corporation s balance sheet 
six unrelated foreclosed real estate properties  which represent percent of the total foreclosed real estate portfolio balance  are described below

as a result  an impairment loss of approximately  and a corresponding increase to the allowance was recognized for this property in the first quarter of property no 
the carrying amount of this property at december  was  which is comprised of the borrower s personal residence presently listed for sale and a acre parcel of unimproved land under contract of sale

in march  the property was sold and the corporation received net proceeds totaling  which it applied against the carrying value bringing it to zero 
at december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans being closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans classified as substandard where we have doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which are not disclosed in table a loss allowance totaling  was established at december   for those potential problem commercial loans that  in our judgment  were under collateralized 
comparatively  we were monitoring approximately million of potential problem loans at december  allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 
an overview of the methodology and key factors that we use in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance and loan impairment is provided in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses consists primarily of three components specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans  allowances calculated for pools of loans and an unallocated component which reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the assumptions that underlie the evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance 
the corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans 
loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics  and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history two year rolling average of net charge offs and qualitative factors  such as the results of internal and external credit reviews  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adequacy of collateral  general economic conditions and the local business outlook 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and fluid 
there is also the potential for adjustment to the allowance as a result of regulatory examinations 
table analysis of allowance for loan losses presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
a more detailed analysis of the allowance for the current year is provided in note allowance for loan losses in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
during  the analysis of adequacy of the allowance was refined to better measure risks associated with quantitative and qualitative risk factors applied to pooled industry segments 
as a result  the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses decreased for december   compared to prior years 
generally  the unallocated component for the year and thereafter reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the loan portfolio 

table of contents the allowance was  or percent of total loans  on december   compared to  and percent  respectively  on december  the increase in the allowance reflects credit quality issues for selected commercial real estate loans and was based on our estimate of the amount necessary to bring the allowance to a level reflective of the risk in the loan portfolio 
we considered macro economic factors such as the prolonged weakness in economic and business conditions that adversely affect the ability of peoplesbank s loan clients to repay their loans  including the high level of unemployment and the probable continuation of a downturn in the commercial real estate market 
based on a comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio  we believe that the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  table analysis of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands balance beginning of year provision charged recovery credited to operating expense loans charged off commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction and land development real estate residential mortgages consumer and home equity total loans charged off recoveries commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate residential mortgages consumer and home equity total recoveries net recoveries charge offs balance end of year ratios net recoveries charge offs as a of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a of total period end loans allowance for loan losses as a of nonperforming loans the trend of increased loan charge offs reflects prolonged weak economic conditions and the effects they had on our commercial borrowers

furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
the consolidated statements of cash flows  included in this report  present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
at year end  we believe that liquidity was adequate based upon the potential liquidation of unpledged available for sale securities with a fair value totaling approximately million and available credit from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh totaling approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was percent for year end  compared to percent for year end off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans  unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities  and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit in the notes to the consolidated financial statements totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 
accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable to smaller reporting companies
