our business general actuate corporation we  actuate or the company was incorporated in november in the state of california and reincorporated in the state of delaware in july actuate provides software and services to develop and deploy custom business intelligence and information applications that deliver rich interactive content that improve customer loyalty and corporate performance 
applications built on actuate s open source based platform provide all stakeholders inside and outside the firewall  including employees  customers  partners and citizens with information that they can easily access and understand to maximize revenue  cut costs  improve customer satisfaction  streamline operations  create competitive advantage and make better decisions 
our goal is to ensure that all users can use decision making information in their day to day activities  opening up completely new avenues for improving corporate performance 
december  in thousands financial summary total revenues total operating expenses income from operations operating margins despite the recent global recession  we have continued to achieve profitability and positive cash flows 
nevertheless  our business model and longer term financial results are not immune to a sustained economic downturn 
for example  the recent domestic and global economic downturn resulted in reduced demand for information technology  including enterprise software and services 
although we anticipate an improved environment  the direction and relative strength of the global economy continues to be uncertain and makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments 
information technology spending has historically declined as general economic and market conditions worsened 
during challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets  many customers delay or reduce technology purchases 
contract negotiations may become more protracted or difficult if customers institute additional internal approvals for technology purchases or require more negotiation of contract terms and conditions 
such economic conditions could result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments  slower adoption of new technologies  increased price competition and reductions in the rate at which our customers renew their maintenance agreements and procure consulting services 
furthermore  a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 

table of contents unfavorable economic conditions have adversely impacted the financial services industry over the past several years 
although we anticipate an improved environment  if this adverse trend were to continue  it would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to continue to invest significant resources to expand our sales and support operations outside north america 
in order to expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  expand our international channel management and support organizations  hire additional personnel  recruit additional international resellers and or increase the productivity of existing international resellers 
factors that may affect our operating results from international operations include the possibility of a prolonged period of limited economic growth or possible economic decline in and adverse effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in europe  including its expected negative impact on european economic growth versus the rest of the world  disruptions to the credit and financial markets in europe  the us  and elsewhere  contractions or limited growth in corporate spending and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to information technology and the software industry 
we continue to monitor market conditions and may make adjustments to our business in order to reduce the adverse impact that changes to the economic environment could have on our business 
we expect to continue to explore both organic and strategic growth opportunities 
in particular  we may acquire companies or technology that can contribute to the strategic  operational and financial performance of our business 
we believe that the combination of our solid financials  leading technology and strong customer relationships will help us successfully execute our strategies 
business model we sell software products through two primary means i directly to end user customers through our direct sales force and ii through indirect channel partners such as oems  resellers and system integrators 
oems generally integrate our products with their applications and either provide hosting services or resell them with their products 
our other indirect channel partners resell our products to end user customers 
our revenues are derived from license fees for software products and fees for services relating to such products  including software maintenance and support  consulting and training 
fiscal year for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded total revenue of million  an increase of over fiscal license revenue was million  almost unchanged compared to the previous year 
our operating income grew by or million to million in fiscal and we generated million of operating cash flows 
diluted earnings per share under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap was in fiscal as compared to for fiscal for an increase of 
we ended fiscal with million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared with million at december  during fiscal  we fully paid down million in outstanding debt and repurchased million of our common stock 
during fiscal  we implemented restructuring actions that resulted in the elimination of positions worldwide  across all levels  primarily within the sales and marketing organization 
we recorded an aggregate charge of  for this restructuring 
also included in the aggregate restructuring charges for the year were  in idle facilities charges related to the closure of one of our xenos facilities in europe and the termination of our subleased facility in south san francisco  california 
historically  restructuring charges have included costs associated with reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred  including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities that we periodically update based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
these estimates were impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 

table of contents during fiscal  the company recorded million of in process research and development ipr d impairment charges 
the company had previously recorded ipr d representing the fair value of a project that was underway at xenos at the time of acquisition 
the product underlying this ipr d item was released on june  and the fair value of this intangible asset was amortized on a straight line basis over the respective estimated useful life of seven years beginning july during the second quarter of  the company deemed that it was necessary to impair this ipr d due to the fact that changes in circumstances indicated to management that the carrying value of the ipr d was not recoverable 
based on an analysis of historical sales of the product since its release in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as the calculation of a discounted cash flow analysis projecting expected cash flows through the remaining useful life of the product  it was determined that the ipr d balance should be impaired down to zero 
in may we paid down the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit 
we used million in cash and short term investments in order to pay down this outstanding debt 
at the end of december  we also amended and re negotiated our credit facility with wells fargo capital finance  llc wfcf resulting in a reduced interest rate and an extension of the term through november  as of december   there was no balance owed on this amended credit facility and the balance available under the revolving credit facility was approximately million 
for further information on the terms of our amended credit facility  please see the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in the fourth quarter of  the remaining minority shareholder of actuate japan notified us that it wished to exercise its rights to put its equity interest in actuate japan 
this minority shareholder exercised its right on december  resulting in a payment from actuate of approximately  for this interest 
as a result of this payment  noncontrolling interest in actuate japan was reduced to zero at december  the difference between the adjustment to the noncontrolling interest and the fair value of the consideration paid totaling approximately  was reported as increase to additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheet on december  our total headcount at the end of fiscal year was compared to employees at the end of last year 
fiscal year a significant portion of our revenues have historically been derived from customers in the financial services industry 
the company expects that it will continue to derive a significant portion of its revenues from these financial services customers for the foreseeable future 
unfavorable economic conditions starting in early fiscal year have adversely impacted it spending in the financial services industry throughout fiscal year if this trend continues into  it will likely have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal year  we expect three additional trends to continue that would have a significant impact on the results of our operations 
we currently believe that corporate it budgets will grow only modestly if at all in the fiscal year  particularly among financial services companies in the united states and western europe 
second  corporations are reluctant to buy software from new vendors and we continue to witness corporations consolidating their business intelligence  analytics and performance management software purchases among fewer suppliers 
finally  we expect to experience vigorous competition in the bi market 
several of our competitors have released products that are marketed to be directly competitive with our offerings 
as one of the few independent bi vendors remaining actuate faces competition from large and well established vendors including microsoft  sap  oracle and ibm all of which have acquired bi players to add to their technology stacks 
the existence of these competitive products may require additional sales and marketing efforts to differentiate our products  which could result in extended sales cycles 
we believe that competition in the bi and information applications market will be vigorous in the near future 

table of contents for fiscal year  we will continue to pursue the strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth driven by birt  initiatives related to performance management  and pursuing opportunities related to traditional xenos markets 
these initiatives are as follows investing in birt we are continuing to make a significant investment in birt 
birt has become widely adopted by developers and continues to drive demand for our birt based commercially available products  including actuateone 
the birt project is a core  long term initiative 
selling to it management we are re focusing our sales efforts on selling our products to it managers who we believe generally recognize the technical advantages of our products 
we hope this initiative will result in increased license revenue in the short term 
selling to line of business management we are creating performance analytics applications and software solutions to market to line of business managers 
these offerings are in the areas of performance management and customer self service and statementing 
we hope these initiatives will result in increased license revenue over the medium to long term 
selling to global corporations in the financial services sector we continue to focus on selling our products to global financial services companies in an effort to increase our substantive market share in this sector 
we anticipate a negative impact of the slow recovery in it spending in this sector through however  we believe that once the issues in financial services are resolved  the industry will once again lead in the adoption of bi and information applications both inside and outside the firewall 
building out and delivering on the roadmap of applying birt to additional data sources including hard to reach print stream data by investing in the development of birt based xenos offerings 
we have a limited ability to forecast future revenues and expenses  thus the prediction of future operating results is difficult 
in addition  historical growth rates in our revenues and earnings should not be considered indicative of future revenue or earnings growth rates or operating results 
there can be no assurance that any of our business strategies will be successful or that we will be able to achieve and maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
it is possible that in some future quarter our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  and in such event the price of our common stock could decline 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  future expectations  and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes accordingly 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  restructuring and integration costs  allocation of purchase price of acquisitions  and the impairment of goodwill  have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our estimates  assumptions and judgments relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue recognition 
actuate generates revenues from the sales of software licenses and related services 
the company receives software license revenues from licensing its products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  system integrators and original equipment manufacturers oems 
the company receives service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that actuate performs for customers 
if the license agreement contains payment terms indicating that the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized as the payments become due and payable  assuming that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
the significant judgments and estimates for revenue recognition typically relate to the timing of an amount recognized for software license fee revenue  including whether collectability is deemed probable  fees are fixed or determinable and services are essential to the functionality of the software 
changes to these assumptions would generally impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized for software related revenues 
the company typically establishes vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for maintenance and support using a bell shaped curve approach 
however  for certain types of license transactions  including oem and site licenses  the company uses a stated maintenance renewal approach 
the application of these rules requires judgment  including the identification of individual elements in multiple element arrangements  whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value  including vsoe of fair value  for some or all elements 
changes to the elements in our sales arrangements  or our ability to establish vsoe or fair value for those elements may impact the timing of recognizing revenue which may result in a material change to the amount of revenue recorded in a given period 
the company assesses the collectability of fees from end users based on payment history and current credit profile 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenues are deferred and recognized upon cash receipt 
our standard payment terms are net days  although we do offer payment terms beyond that in some cases 
we periodically provide extended payment terms and we consider any fees due beyond days to not be fixed or determinable 
in such cases  judgment is required in determining the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks 
our gross accounts receivable is reserved against this risk through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors 
we look at factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
these factors are reviewed to determine whether a specific reserve for bad debt should be recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount believed to be collectible 
we also cease recognizing future revenues on any outstanding domestic maintenance renewal invoices which are older than days past due 
we also record unspecified reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including length of time the receivables are past due and historical experience 
a reserve percentage is applied to various aged categories of receivables based on historical experience to determine how much of an unspecified reserve is needed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense over the service period for awards that are expected to vest based on the fair value measurement for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases 
we calculate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the use of a black scholes merton model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected life  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected forfeiture rate 
as a result  the 
table of contents future stock based compensation expense may differ from our historical amounts 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of the expected term of options granted is derived from historical share option exercise experience 
in the future  we may change our estimate of the expected term  which would impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 
income taxes 
we provide for the effect of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  net operating loss carryovers  and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
we also apply a two step approach to determining the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
income tax expense or benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision benefit for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision benefit for income taxes include the geographic mix and amount of income loss  our interpretation of current tax laws  and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
our judgments also include anticipating the tax positions we will record in the financial statements before actually preparing and filing the tax returns 
our estimates and assumptions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified or resolved 
changes in our business  tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws  and developments in current and future tax audits  could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carry forwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
to make this assessment  we take into account predictions of the amount and category of taxable income from various sources and all available positive and negative evidence about these possible sources of taxable income 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the strength of the evidence can be objectively verified 
based on the analysis of positive and negative factors noted above  we have no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets generated in the company s us jurisdiction 
we maintain a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions with a history of losses and a partial valuation allowance in foreign jurisdictions where operating results beyond a certain time frame are less reliable 
if  in the future  we determine that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an income tax benefit in the period such determination is made 

table of contents we only recognize an income tax expense or benefit with respect to uncertain tax positions in our financial statements that we judge is more likely than not to be sustained solely on its technical merits in a tax audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
to make this judgment  we must interpret complex and sometimes ambiguous tax laws  regulations and administrative practices 
if an income tax position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  then we must measure the amount of the tax benefit to be recognized by determining the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than a likelihood of being realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all of the relevant facts 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible settlement outcomes 
to determine if a tax position is effectively settled  we must also estimate the likelihood that a taxing authority would review a tax position after a tax examination has otherwise been completed 
we must also determine when it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease in the months after each fiscal year end 
these judgments are difficult because a taxing authority may change its behavior as a result of our disclosures in our financial statements 
we must reevaluate our income tax positions on a quarterly basis to consider factors such as changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
accrual for restructuring charges 
we incurred certain restructuring charges that were a combination of reductions in workforce  exits of idle facilities and disposals of fixed assets 
these restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred  including estimates of sublease income on portions of our idle facilities 
we periodically update the estimates based on market conditions and in accordance with our restructuring plans 
updates to estimates of sublease income were not significant in fiscal years  and acquisitions purchase price allocation 
we allocate the purchase price of an acquired business to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying acquired net tangible and intangible assets  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  and widely accepted valuation techniques 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from software license sales  subscriptions  support agreements  consulting contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s trade name and trademarks as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademarks will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
in connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligations assumed 
we adjust the preliminary purchase price allocation  as necessary  typically up to one year after the acquisition closing date as we obtain more information regarding asset valuations and liabilities assumed 
for additional discussion  see note  acquisition of xenos group inc  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this form k 

table of contents valuation of goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the company begins its impairment test by applying a market approach 
given the company has one reporting unit  this approach involves comparing the market capitalization of the company to its carrying value 
if this market approach derives a fair value that significantly exceeds the carrying value of the company then no further testing is performed 
however  if the market approach indicates the fair value does not significantly exceed the carrying value of the company  we perform a supplemental calculation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach 
we then consider the results of both the market approach and income approach to determine whether or not it is necessary to move to the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis in order to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
thus far  the market approach has consistently indicated that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was significantly higher than the carrying value 
therefore  we have determined that there has been no impairment and consequently it has not been necessary to perform a supplemental income approach to the valuation

table of contents revenues year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands our revenues are derived from license fees and services  which include software maintenance and support  consulting  and training 
the increase in our total revenues in fiscal was due to increase in north america revenues of approximately or million  partially offset by weaker license sales in europe  increase in maintenance renewal revenues of approximately or million  continued momentum in birt related product sales  and corresponding services 
our north america revenues were higher primarily due to improving license sales  which increased by or million 
this increase was despite the fact that in fiscal we concluded on a large transaction with ibm regarding distributions of actuate software by ibm 
as a result of that transaction  we recorded million of revenue in north america in the third quarter of fiscal of this total  approximately million was apportioned to license and the remaining million to maintenance revenue 
revenues outside of north america increased by  or approximately million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year this increase was driven by a or million increase in asia  offset by or  decrease in europe 
these international revenues represented of our total revenues in fiscal and foreign currency exchange gains positively impacted our international revenues during fiscal for fiscal year we closed transactions in excess of  and recognized license revenue of million or more on transactions 
the number of orders greater than million has historically ranged from none to three per quarter 
we do not expect to rely on any one customer for our future business 
the increase in our total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a favorable transaction with ibm totaling million  which ended a dispute regarding distributions of actuate software by ibm  revenues from our acquisition of xenos  which was completed in february of  and revenues from our transaction with oracle during the second quarter of  which ended a dispute regarding distributions of actuate software by oracle 
the agreement required oracle to pay actuate a total of million 
the terms of the agreement called for equal cash payments by oracle to actuate between june and march in accordance with a pre determined schedule 
accordingly  actuate recognizes the revenue similar to an extended payment term contract 
consequently  every period as the payments from oracle become due  approximately million of revenue is recognized by actuate 
this amount is apportioned between license and maintenance revenue based on the maintenance rate dictated in the underlying oracle contract 
despite the ibm and oracle transactions  which were apportioned between license and maintenance revenue  we experienced lower services revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal as declining license revenues from the onset of the global recession in early resulted in a negative compounding effect on our maintenance revenues 
these decreases in maintenance revenues were partially offset by an in increase in our professional services revenues as a result of our acquisition of xenos in february no single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for any of the periods presented 

table of contents license revenue year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands license revenue in fiscal remained unchanged compared with fiscal fiscal included a large transaction with ibm that resulted in approximately million of additional license revenues 
our birt based product sales increased by during fiscal as we continue to see new customer additions  higher transaction counts as well as increases in average order sizes 
similar positive trends in north america and asia resulted in increased license revenues of or approximately million and or approximately  over last year  respectively 
these positive trends were offset by weaker european license sales which decreased or approximately million 
the increase in license revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of the ibm and oracle transactions  which combined  accounted for approximately of our total fiscal license revenues 
we also experienced growth in license revenues from the acquisition of xenos  which was completed in february this growth was tempered by continued challenging economic conditions which caused customers to delay purchases or rely on expanding existing infrastructure server environments 
license revenue by region dollars in thousands year ended december  to to change change change change north america europe asia pacific total license revenue percentage of total revenue for fiscal year  north america accounted for approximately of the total license revenue while the europe and asia pacific regions combined accounted for of the total license revenues 
for the same period last year  north america accounted for approximately of the total license revenue while the europe and asia pacific regions combined accounted for of the total license revenues 
total license revenues were positively impacted by foreign currency exchange gains of approximately  primarily due to the strength of the swiss franc against the us dollar 
for the same period last year  total license revenues were negatively impacted by approximately  primarily due to the strength of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro  partially offset by the weakness against the canadian dollar

table of contents services revenue is comprised of maintenance and support  professional services  and training 
services revenue increased or approximately million driven by improved maintenance renewal rates from in fiscal to in fiscal as well as higher revenues associated with incremental increases in license revenues during fiscal and also  our prior year services revenues were negatively impacted due to the fact that certain revenue could not be recognized due to the impact of purchase accounting on the acquired xenos maintenance contracts 
current year service revenues were also positively impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations in europe 
the decrease in services revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal was driven primarily by a decrease in our non xenos maintenance and support revenues 
this decrease in our maintenance and support revenues was triggered by reductions in our license revenues from the onset of the global recession in early which resulted in a negative compounding effect on our maintenance revenues 
in addition  we experienced higher declines in maintenance renewals primarily related to certain of our legacy products 
partially offsetting these decreases were increases in maintenance and support revenues from the ibm and oracle transactions 
our professional services and consulting revenues increased during fiscal compared with fiscal mainly because of the acquisition of xenos in february excluding xenos  our professional services revenues continue to decline from fiscal levels as we saw an increase in the adoption of birt based projects by our customers during fiscal we experienced a growth in our birt related business during fiscal these birt based projects do not require professional service to the same extent as the company s traditional designer products 
services revenue by region dollars in thousands year ended december  to to change change change change north america europe apac total services revenue percentage of total revenue by region  north america accounted for approximately of the total services revenue in fiscal while europe and asia pacific regions accounted for and of the total services revenues  respectively 
the increase in service revenue in europe was primarily attributed to favorable currency exchange rate fluctuations as swiss franc appreciated against the us dollar during fiscal the increase in asia pacific region was due to a large transaction in japan 
by region  north america accounted for approximately of the total services revenue in fiscal while europe and asia pacific regions accounted for and of the total services revenues  respectively 
costs and expenses cost of license fees year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands percent of license revenue 
table of contents cost of license fees consists primarily of salaries  production costs including printing and packaging  amortization of purchased technologies  third party royalty fees and localization costs 
the decrease in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period was primarily related to additional production related expenses incurred during fiscal associated with the release of actuateone 
also in december we fully amortized the purchase technologies associated with our january acquisition of performancesoft which resulted in lower amortization expense in fiscal compared to the corresponding periods last year 
the increase in cost of license fees in absolute dollars for fiscal year  compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year  was due primarily to the amortization of xenos purchased intangibles  which we started amortizing in february of  third party commissions incurred on the sale of xenos software and production related expenses associated with the release of actuateone 
we expect our cost of license fees as a percentage of license revenues to remain between and for fiscal cost of services year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands percent of services revenue cost of services consists primarily of personnel and related costs  stock based compensation  facilities costs incurred providing software maintenance and support  training and consulting services  as well as third party costs incurred in providing training and consulting services 
the increase in cost of services for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was due partially to the timing of the acquisition of xenos in february  which resulted in eleven months of xenos expenses in fiscal compared with a full year of expenses in fiscal commission and bonus expense increased by approximately million in fiscal due primarily to higher compliance related bookings 
the compliance group is an internal organization established to monitor and ensure that our customers remain in full compliance with the provisions of their respective licensing agreements with actuate 
improved maintenance renewal rates during the year resulted in higher maintenance and support revenues which resulted in additional bonuses to the maintenance group 
in addition  we experienced increased third party consulting fees of approximately  due to a significant customer migration project in the first half of fiscal  which placed a higher demand on our professional services partners as we lacked sufficient internal actuate resources to meet the customer dates 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower salaries and benefits of approximately  due to a continued decrease in our average professional services headcount and lower stock based compensation expenses 
the increase in cost of services for fiscal  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year  was primarily due to our acquisition of xenos in february of this increase was partially offset by decreases in employee compensation and related costs 
we experienced continued reductions in consulting revenues as demand for actuate s professional services engagements decreased during fiscal as a result  we reduced our average non xenos professional consulting headcount by approximately or employees from in fiscal to employees during fiscal these reductions in headcount translated to lower compensation  employee benefits  travel and third party consulting expenses for non xenos professional services personnel  totaling approximately  during fiscal these reductions in cost were offset by an overall increase in cost of services due to our acquisition of xenos in february of

the increase in fiscal was due partially to the timing of the acquisition of xenos in february  which resulted in eleven months of xenos expenses in fiscal compared with a full year of expenses in fiscal in addition  salaries  benefits  stock based compensation and employee travel combined to account for approximately  of the increase in fiscal expenses 
the increase in salaries was due to a slight increase in our average year to date sales and marketing headcount as well as annual merit increases 
marketing program expenses increased by approximately  mainly due to the use of onsite vendors for webinars  advertising and web marketing for conference sponsorships 
also in fiscal internal marketing support costs allocated to the services group decreased due to lower professional services revenues and average headcount 
additionally  we experienced increases in recruiting and third party commission costs during fiscal offsetting these increases was a decrease in employee training and seminars during fiscal non xenos sales and marketing expenses decreased in almost every category during fiscal as compared to fiscal compensation related expenses decreased by approximately million as our average non xenos headcount decreased by approximately or employees from in fiscal to during fiscal most of the decrease in compensation expense was driven by lower salaries and benefits due to these headcount reductions 
these decreases were partially offset by higher commissions due to increase in license revenues 
we also continued our efforts to streamline our processes and lower operating expenses 
significant decreases were reflected in lower contractor costs of approximately  lower travel expenses of approximately  and lower marketing program expenses of approximately million 
the remaining reductions in marketing expenses were due to consolidation and streamlining of programs as well as scaling down of event costs 
these decreases were offset by increased operating expenses as a result of our acquisition of xenos in february of we currently expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we expect to add new sales headcount to create higher sales capacity

we also incurred approximately  in acquisition related costs in fiscal due to the acquisition of xenos 
these decreases in legal and acquisition related costs were partially offset by approximately million of increases in employee compensation and related expenses due to increased management bonuses associated with improved overall performance  stock based compensation and annual merit increases 
we also experienced increase in expenses of approximately  related to various state and local tax audits which were concluded in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased legal fees of approximately million resulting primarily from contract compliance matters 
our acquisition of xenos during the first quarter of also accounted for approximately  of acquisition related expenses

table of contents amortization of purchased intangibles year ended december  to to change change change change dollars in thousands percent of total revenue in accordance with the authoritative guidance issued by fasb related to goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform a goodwill impairment test at least annually  which we complete on october of each year

for fiscal  we expect amortization expense related to other purchased intangible assets to remain consistent with fiscal levels 
asset impairment during fiscal we recorded million of in process research and development ipr d impairment charges 
we had previously recorded ipr d representing the fair value of a project that was underway at xenos at the time of acquisition 
the product underlying this ipr d item was released on june  and the fair value of this intangible asset was amortized on a straight line basis over the respective estimated useful life of seven years beginning july during the second quarter of  we deemed that it was necessary to impair this ipr d due to the fact that changes in circumstances indicated to management that the carrying value of the ipr d was not recoverable 
accordingly  we used level inputs to measure the fair value associated with this ipr d 
based on an analysis of historical sales of the product since its release in the second quarter of fiscal  as well as the calculation of a discounted cash flow analysis projecting expected cash flows through the remaining useful life of the product  it was determined that the ipr d balance should be impaired down to zero 
the fair value of other identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations using the income approach 
other intangible assets consist of purchased technology and patents  customer lists and relationships  distribution agreements  and trademarks  all of which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review other intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the carrying value may not be recoverable

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is primarily a result of credit risk  fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
foreign currency exchange risk 
during fiscal years  and we derived  and  respectively  of our total revenues from sales outside of north america 
we face exposure to market risk on the related receivables with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
our international revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the british pound sterling 
the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  transaction gains and losses may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
our losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations were approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and approximately  during fiscal we performed a sensitivity analysis on the net monetary accounts subject to revaluation that are held primarily by our international subsidiaries 
we used the following steps to determine the approximate impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations identified material net monetary assets held in non functional currencies 
these primarily consist of the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  and the us dollar based net assets held by our international subsidiaries 
applied hypothetical changes in exchange rates to these net monetary balances held by each subsidiary as identified above 
the result was a hypothetical revaluation gain or loss in the subsidiary s functional currency 
we then translated the revaluation result as described above to us dollars using the latest quarter average exchange rate 
this resulted in hypothetical revaluation gains or losses before income taxes 
these hypothetical results are summarized in the table below as of december  annual change in currency exchange in thousands interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest primarily in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe that there is limited risk exposure 
credit risk 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  and trade accounts receivable 
we have policies that limit investments in investment grade securities and the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we sell primarily to customers in the financial services industry  predominantly in the united states and europe 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions adversely impacting the financial services industry has had a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the financial services industry has experienced and may continue to experience cyclical fluctuations in profitability  which may affect timing of  or actual purchases of  our products which would have a material adverse effect on the our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there was no customer that accounted for more than of total sales in fiscal 
table of contents we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain an allowance for potential credit losses 
we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
our credit risk is also mitigated because our customer base is diversified by geography 
we generally do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge the risk in receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not believe that future market equity or interest rate risks related to our marketable investments or debt obligations will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the company is not currently invested in any derivative securities 
european debt exposures 
we actively monitor our exposure to the european markets  including the impact of sovereign debt issues associated with greece  ireland  portugal  italy and spain 
as of december   we do not have any direct or indirect investments in the sovereign debt  corporations  or financial institutions of these countries
