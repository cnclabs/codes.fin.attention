liquidity and capital resources our ability to generate significant cash flows from operating activities is one the company s fundamental financial strengths 
our principal sources of liquidity are the cash flows provided by our operating activities  our revolving credit facility  and cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we intend to utilize cash flows generated by our ongoing operating activities  in combination with possibly expanding our commercial lending facility  and the possible issuance of additional equity or debt securities to fund capital expenditures and organic growth initiatives  to make strategic business acquisitions  to retire outstanding indebtedness  and to possibly repurchase shares of our common stock as market and operating conditions warrant 
in the th quarter of the company paid its first quarterly dividend in the amount of per common share  paying million in the aggregate in regards to this dividend issuance 
this same quarterly dividend per share was paid in february the company intends to use a portion of its operating cash flows to continue issuing dividends to its shareholders in the foreseeable future  while remaining dedicated to using most of its cash to generate improvement in future earnings by funding organic growth initiatives and accretive business acquisitions 
we believe that anticipated cash flows provided by our operating activities  together with current cash balances and access to our credit facilities and the capital markets  if required  will be sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements for the next twelve months  and the foreseeable future thereafter  although any projections of future cash needs  cash flows  and the general market condition for credit and equity securities may be subject to substantial uncertainty 
in the event additional liquidity needs arise  we may raise funds from a combination of sources  including the potential issuance of debt or equity securities 
however  there are no assurances that such financing facilities will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
we continue to strategically evaluate our ability to sell additional equity or debt securities  and to expand existing or obtain new credit facilities from lenders in order to strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we regularly evaluate our liquidity requirements  including the need for additional debt or equity offerings  when considering potential business acquisitions  development of new products or services  or the retirement of debt 
during the company intends to utilize its cash and other financing resources towards making strategic accretive acquisitions in the insurance data exchange arena  to fund new product development and service offerings  and to fund other organic growth initiatives 
our cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company holds material cash and cash equivalent balances overseas in foreign jurisdictions 
the free flow of cash from certain countries where we hold such balances may be subject to repatriation tax effects and other restrictions 
furthermore  the repatriation of earnings from some of our foreign subsidiaries would result in the application of withholding taxes at source as well as a tax at the us parent level upon receipt of the repatriation amounts 
the approximate cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments balances held in our domestic us operations and each of our foreign subsidiaries as of march  is presented in table below figures denominated in thousands united states canada latin america australia singapore new zealand india sweden total cash and st investments due to the effect of temporary or timing differences resulting from the differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes and minimum alternative tax obligations in the us and india  future cash outlays for income taxes are expected to exceed current income tax expense but will not adversely impact the company s liquidity position 
specifically our operations in india benefit from a tax holiday which will continue through  as such the company s local india taxable income  other than passive interest and rental income  is not taxed 
after the tax holiday expires taxable income generated by our india operations will be taxed at of the normal corporate tax rate for a period of five years 
during the year this tax holiday had the effect of reducing tax expense by million 
the company also has a relatively low income tax rate is in singapore in which our operations are taxed at a marginal tax rate as a result of concessions granted by the local singapore economic development board for the benefit of in country intellectual property owners 
the concessionary income tax rate will expire after  at which time our singapore operations will be subject to the prevailing corporate tax rate in singapore  which is currently  unless the company reaches a subsequent agreement to extend the incentive period and the then applicable 
table of contents concessionary rate 
the concession granted by the edb improved net income by million 
our current ratio declined to at december  as compared to at december  and our working capital position declined to million at december  as compared to million at the end of the the reduction in our short term liquidity position is primarily due to increased trade accounts payable and an increase in deferred revenue liabilities associated with our growing business 
we believe that our ability to generate sustainable and robust cash flows from operations will enable the company to continue to fund its current liabilities from current assets including available cash balances for the foreseeable future

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements the following is a brief discussion of recently released accounting pronouncements that are pertinent to the company s business in june  the fasb issued new financial reporting guidance regarding the reporting of other comprehensive income  or oci 
this guidance revises the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income  or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used currently  and the second statement would include components of oci 
under either method  entities must display adjustments for items that are reclassified from oci to net income in both net income and oci 
the new reporting guidance does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
this new reporting standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   however  the fasb recently decided to defer the effective date for the part of this new guidance that would require adjustments of items out of accumulated other income to be presented as components of both net income and other comprehensive income in financial statements 
those changes would have been effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after december   but are now deferred until fasb can adequately evaluate the costs and benefits of this presentation requirement 
after adoption  the guidance must be applied retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements 
the company will adopt this new guidance promptly when required  however we do not expect that it will have a material impact on our financial position or operating results as the only element of comprehensive income relevant to ebix is in regards to cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments 
in september  the fasb issued new technical guidance regarding an entity s evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment 
under this new guidance an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step quantitative impairment test is unnecessary 
this new technical guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption was permitted for annual and interim goodwill impairment evaluations performed as of a date before september  if an entity s financial statements for the most recent annual or interim period have not yet been issued 
the company elected to adopt early and accordingly applied this new guidance to its annual impairment evaluation of goodwill 
in december  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached consensus regarding the disclosure of pro forma information for business combinations 
this new guidance addressed the diversity in practice concerning the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the guidance specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the new guidance was applicable to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted this new guidance in and applied it to the disclosures regarding our recent acquisitions of adam  completed in february  and health connect  completed in november in january  the fasb issued new guidance regarding disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires additional disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in earlier related guidance 
specifically this new guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers  and for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
also a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
this new guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the company adopted and applied this technical guidance in september  fasb issued amended revenue recognition guidance related to revenue arrangements with multiple 
table of contents deliverables 
this new pronouncement a provides application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist in an arrangement with a customer  and if so  how the arrangement consideration should be separated and allocated  b requires an entity to allocate revenue using estimated selling prices of deliverables if vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe of selling prices is not available  and  c eliminates the use of the residual method to allocate revenue

also in september  the fasb issued new guidance related to certain revenue arrangements that include software elements and provides guidance on determining whether software deliverables in an arrangement that include tangible products are within the scope of existing software revenue guidance 
this guidance is to be applied on a prospective basis for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with earlier application permitted 
alternatively  an entity can elect to adopt new guidance on a retrospective basis 
the company adopted this new guidance in and its adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operation 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as promulgated in the united states  requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve the use of critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates that we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information about these policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are limited based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues primarily from professional and support services  which includes subscription and transaction fees pertaining to services delivered over our exchanges or from our asp platforms  revenue generated from software development projects and associated fees for consulting  implementation  training  and project management provided to customers with installed systems  and business process outsourcing revenue 
sales and value added taxes are not included in revenues  but rather are recorded as a liability until the taxes assessed are remitted to the respective taxing authorities 
in accordance with financial accounting standard board fasb and securities and exchange commission staff accounting sec accounting guidance on revenue recognition the company considers revenue earned and realizable when a persuasive evidence of the sales arrangement exists  b the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable  c service delivery or performance has occurred  d customer acceptance has been received  if contractually required  and e collectability of the arrangement fee is probable 
the company typically uses signed contractual agreements as persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement 
we apply the provisions of the relevant fasb accounting pronouncements when making estimates or assumptions related to transactions involving the license of software where the software deliverables are considered more than inconsequential to the other elements in the arrangement 
for contracts that contain multiple deliverables  we analyze the revenue arrangements when making estimates or assumptions in accordance with the appropriate authoritative guidance  which provides criteria governing how to determine whether goods or services that are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be considered as separate units of accounting for the purpose of revenue recognition 
deliverables are accounted for separately if they meet all of the following criteria a the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  b there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items  and c if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  the delivery or performance of the undelivered items is probable and substantially controlled by the company 
the company begins to recognize revenue from license fees for its asp products upon delivery and the customer s acceptance of the software implementation and customizations if necessary and applicable 
transaction services fee revenue for this use of our exchanges or asp platforms is recognized as the transactions occur and are generally billed in arrears 
service fees 
table of contents for hosting arrangements are recognized over the requisite service period 
revenue derived from the licensing of third party software products in connection with sales of the company s software licenses and is recognized upon delivery together with the company s licensed software products 
training  data conversion  installation  and consulting services fees are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
revenue for maintenance and support services is recognized ratably over the term of the support agreement 
revenues derived from initial setup or registration fees are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement in accordance with fasb and sec accounting guidance on revenue recognition 
deferred revenue includes maintenance and support payments or billings that have been received and recorded prior to performance and  in certain cases  cash collections  initial setup or registration fees under hosting agreements  software license fees received in advance of delivery  acceptance  and or completion of the earnings process  and amounts received under multi element arrangements in which objective evidence of the fair value for the undelivered elements does not exist 
in these instances revenue is recognized when the fair value of the undelivered elements is determinable or when all contractual elements have been completed and delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  write offs  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating uncertainties and estimate as to the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable and the adequacy of the company s recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
valuation of goodwill goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
the company applies the provisions of the fasb s accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets which addresses how goodwill and other acquired intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements 
in this regard we test these intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment are present 
such potential impairment indicators include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  and the sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business 
the testing involves comparing the reporting unit and intangible asset carrying values to their respective fair values  we determine fair value by applying the discounted cash flow method using the present value of future estimated net cash flows 
the cash flow projections are based on our views of growth rates  anticipated future economic conditions and the appropriate discount rates relative to risk and estimates of residual values 
we believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value 
the use of different estimates or assumptions for our projected discounted cash flows eg  growth rates  future economic conditions  discount rates and estimates of terminal values when determining the fair value of our reporting units could result in different values and may result in a goodwill impairment charge 
during the twelve months ended december    and  we had no impairment of our reporting unit goodwill balances 
for additional information about goodwill  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb accounting guidance on the accounting and disclosure of income taxes  which involves estimating the company s current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the company has not recognized a deferred us tax liability and associated income tax expense for the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because the from these foreign subsidiaries will remain permanently reinvested in those subsidiaries to fund ongoing operations and growth 
the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability as of december  would have been approximately million the company follows the provisions of fasb accounting guidance on accounting for uncertain income tax positions 
this guidance clarified the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
the guidance utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
recognition step occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step is only addressed if step has been satisfied 
under step  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rates risk is related to our foreign based operations where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of those currencies 
a majority of the company s operations are based in the us and  accordingly  a large component of our business transactions are denominated in us dollars  however  the company has operations in australia  new zealand  singapore  brazil  and india  and we conduct transactions in the local currencies of each of these locations 
there can be no assurance that fluctuations in the value of those foreign currencies will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  revenues or financial condition 
during the years of and the net change in the cumulative foreign currency translation account  which is a component of stockholders equity  was an unrealized gain loss of million  and million respectively 
the company considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in our respective foreign currency exchange rates of could possibly be experienced in the near term future 
such an adverse change in currency exchange rates would have resulted in reduction to pre tax income of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk relates to its interest expense on outstanding debt obligations and to its interest income on existing cash balances 
as of december  the company had million of outstanding debt obligations which consisted of a million balance on our commercial banking revolving line of credit and a million secured term loan 
the company s revolving line of credit bears interest at the rate of libor  and stood at at december  the company is exposed to market risk in relation to this line of credit in regards to the potential increase to interest expense arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase in the libor rate 
such an adverse change in the libor rate would have resulted in a reduction to pre tax income of approximately thousand and thousand for the years ending december  and  respectively 
the company s average cash balances during were million and its existing cash balances as of december  was million 
the company is exposed to market risk in relation to these cash balances in regards to the potential loss of interest income arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
this interest rate risk is estimated as the potential decrease in earnings resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates earned on deposited funds 
such an adverse change in these interest rates would have resulted in a reduction to pre tax income of approximately thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we entered into a series of six month and one year forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the intercompany receivables originated by our indian subsidiary that are denominated in united states dollars 
these u 
s dollars indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement in exchange rates on future operating costs  and to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in u 
s dollars indian rupee currency exchange rate 
as of december   the notional value of these contracts which are scheduled to mature in march is million 
changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated income statement 
we use these instruments as economic hedges  intended to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates  and not for speculative purposes 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives partially offset gains and losses on the intercompany receivables being hedged 
for the twelve months ended december  and  we recognized a gain loss of million and million  respectively  on these derivative instruments which included in foreign exchange gain in the consolidated statements of income 
based upon a sensitivity analysis performed against our forward foreign exchange contracts at december  and  which measures the hypothetical change in the fair value of the contracts resulting from shift in the value of exchange rates of the indian rupee relative to the us dollar 
a appreciation in the us dollar against the indian rupee and a corresponding increase in the value of the hedged assets would lead to a decrease in the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation in the us dollar against the indian rupee would lead to an increase in the fair value of our forward foreign exchange contracts by million and million 
we regularly review our hedging strategies and may in the future  as a part of this review  determine the need to change our hedging activities 

table of contents during the year ending december  in connection with the acquisition of e z data ebix issued a put option to the sellers  with respect to the shares of ebix common stock that were issued as part of the acquisition consideration  which was exercisable during the month of october  which if exercised would enable them to sell the shares back to the ebix at a price of per share  which represents a discount off of the per share value established on the effective date of the closing of ebix s acquisition of e z data 
using a black scholes model we determined that the initial fair value for the put option was million and that its fair value on december  and had decreased by million and million  respectively 
the inputs used in the valuation of the put option include term  stock price volatility  current stock price  exercise price  and the risk free rate of return  with the volatility factor being the input subject to the most variation 
the put expired unexercised at october
