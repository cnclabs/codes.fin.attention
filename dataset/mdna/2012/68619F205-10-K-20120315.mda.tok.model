results of operations comparison of the year ended december  and revenue of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue from sales of offset printing paper for purpose of this analysis  offset printing paper includes minor revenue from sales of diazo and copy papers  which occurred in the year of only and corrugating medium paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in in addition to the rising selling prices in the first three quarters of and other factors explained below  because of the loss of steam pressure caused by the removal of two old boilers for the installation of two new energy efficient steam boilers during most part of the third quarter of  total offset printing and corrugating medium paper produced and sold during the year ended december  were less than the quantity and dollar amount in the comparable period in starting december  we produce and sell corrugating medium paper from a new paper production line with a designed capacity of  tons year 
the total quantity of corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper sold in the year ended december  amounted to  tons  a net increase of  tons or  compared to  tons sold in the previous year

we believe the increase in asp is primarily attributable to increasing customer demand  and more importantly a regional shortage in paper products supply  caused by mandatory closures of other smaller paper manufacturers under government mandates in and for the most part of for example  the provincial government of hebei announced on june  that it was working on closing inefficient paper production lines with local paper mills by the end of the year  accounting for an elimination of annual capacity of approximately  tons in  while the neighboring province of henan announced that it was closing more than local paper mills with an aggregate capacity of over million tons of paper production 
the ministry of industry and information technology of the people s republic of china announced on july  that million tons of outdated paper milling capacities located in paper companies across china would be forced to close down in the year the mandatory closure 
of all of the paper mills affected by the mandatory closure  companies with total capacities of million tons or of total closure were located in the province of hebei  where many of the old paper mills only have capacities under  tons 
our neighboring province of henan saw million tons capacities or of total closure  owned by companies  had been eliminated before the end of many industry commentators believe that the mandatory closure impacted mostly packaging paper  printing paper and household paper supplies in china in and has driven up selling prices of these products 
however  as of december   we have seen asp increases leveling out and stabilized 
some of our paper products eg  offset printing paper may even experience slight downward asp adjustment in the next few months 
beginning in late june  we shut down and later demolished one of our two corrugating medium paper production lines 
we had originally planned to build the new  ton year new corrugating medium paper production line and other facilities on approximately  square meters of land across the street of our current main manufacturing compound  but due to certain changes in the plan  we decided to instead build the new production line in our current manufacturing compound 
to make room for the new production line and related pulping facilities  we tore down two existing buildings and an existing corrugating medium paper production line 
we estimate the lost capacity was approximately  tons per year 
we completed testing operations of the new production line in november and produced  tons of corrugating medium paper from the new line in december revenue from medium grade offset printing paper amounted to  or of total offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue for the year ended december   which represents an  or increase over the medium grade offset printing paper revenue of  for the comparable period in we sold  tons of medium grade offset printing paper in the year ended december  compared to  tons of medium grade offset printing paper in the comparable period in year  an increase of  tons or 
the factors contributing to the increase in both total quantity and dollar amount sold include lower production quantity in the third quarter  due to the installation of new boilers to replace the two old ones  the increase in asp for offset printing paper products from ton in the year of to ton in  representing an increase of  and a regional shortage in paper products supply  caused by the mandatory closure 
absent further government mandated capacity closure in the next few months  we believe the asps of our printing paper products are being stabilized 
our asp for offset printing paper has started declining in the last two months of year and may remain slightly lower as a correction to the under supplied market situation and as a reflection of the softening economy 
as a partial remedy for the lost production due to the disposal and temporary removal of two old boilers in the second half of  starting in august  the company entered into four offset printing paper supply agreements with paper manufacturers in hebei province and the neighboring shandong province the supply agreements 
during the year ended december   revenue generated from sales of offset printing paper finished goods purchased from these vendors pursuant to the supply agreements was in the amount of  or  tons  representing of total sales revenue of medium grade offset printing paper during the year ended december  the sales of finished goods during the year ended december  was  for the last five months of the year  but nevertheless accounted for of the total sales made during the year of although gross profit margin of sales of paper purchased under these supply agreements registers significantly less than that of our own products see discussions under gross profit below  we intend to extend these supply agreements past their current expiration as long as market conditions permit 
the following is a chart showing the month by month asps except for the asps of the digital photo paper for the two year period ended december

monthly sales revenue  including revenue from the sales of purchased paper finished goods and excluding revenue of digital photo paper  for the two year period ended december   are summarized below 
monthly sales in july august were substantially lower than average mainly because of the loss of two old boilers as explained above 
monthly sales in february of and were seasonably lower because of the extended chinese new year holiday break

during the second quarter of the year  we made the decision to significantly lower the asp by producing more light weight digital photo paper products to meet the needs of different customers 
we lowered the asp from  ton in june to  ton in june the lowest since the inception of the operation  and as a result  monthly sales quantity increased from  and tons in july  august and september to tons in december digital photo paper products monthly asps  monthly sales quantity in tons and monthly sales revenue for the period from july to december  are summarized as follows 
pgjpg 
cost of sales total cost of sales for corrugating medium and offset printing paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase in total cost of sales in the year of is primarily due to the increase in sales revenue over the last year when the new boilers were being installed  as explained above 
total sales revenue excluding revenue from sales of digital photo paper grew from  in to  in the year of  representing a year over year increase  which is primarily accountable for the increase in cost of sales in the increase in cost of sales also is largely attributable to the ever rising cost of raw materials  as total quantity sold on corrugating medium and offset printing paper grew only in year on a year over year basis 
monthly average purchase costs of our major raw materials for the two year period from january to december are as follows 
pgjpg 
costs for all types of raw materials in the month period ended december  were generally on an upward trend and appeared to have reached the highest point over the period in october for example  our average unit purchase cost net of applicable value added tax of recycled paper board  recycled white scrap paper  and recycled printed paper in the month of october were ton  ton  and ton  respectively  which represent year over year increases of   and as compared to what we paid per unit for these raw materials a year ago 
although our production takes advantage entirely of domestic recycled paper produced mainly from the beijing metropolitan area and do not have to rely on imported recycled paper  which tends to have a more volatile pricing behavior than the domestic recycled paper  it appears that demand for domestic paper is on the rise 
according to the china paper association s annual report  consumption of domestic recycled paper pulp in china increased from in to of total pulp used in the year of because of the rising demand and the effect of inflation on various production factors of recycled paper  we estimate that all of the raw material prices may see keep rising in the long term 
however  due to the softening economy in china  we have seen prices declining across the board for all of our major recycled paper raw materials 
it is likely that raw material prices will continue to be relatively low in the next few months 
electricity and coal are the two main sources of our paper manufacturing activities 
coal prices have been subject to seasonal fluctuations in china  with peaks often occurring in the winter months 
historically  electricity and coal account for approximately and of our total cost of sales  or approximately and of total sales  respectively 
the monthly energy costs electricity and coal as a percentage of total monthly cost of sales excluding the cost of sales purchased from other paper product suppliers and not manufactured by us  as well as the cost of sales of digital photo paper of our main paper products for the two years ended december  are summarized as follows 
pgjpg 
because of the increase in total cost of sales caused by inflating recycled paper raw material prices  total energy electricity and coal cost accounted for of the total cost of sales excluding costs of sales of purchased finished goods and digital photo paper in the year ended december   which is noticeably less as compared to of total cost of sales for the year ended december  we observed a spike in unit cost in both coal and electricity in the last two months of year however  we believe the increases are within reasonable range and may be temporary 
the total cost of sales of digital photo paper amounted to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of  or  over the cost of sales of  in the comparable period in year the increase appears to be attributable to the growth in sales of our digital photo paper 
as explained above  the quantity in tonnage of our digital photo paper sales increased in the year of as compared to the previous year in gross profit gross profit for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year ended december  was  a net increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the net increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the low production output in the third quarter of caused by the disruption of production for the replacement work of two boilers 
because of this  quantities sold for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper were much lower than normal level in the third quarter of  resulting in a lower gross profit for the year  capacity utilization was lower  resulting in lower gross profit margins of corrugating medium and offset printing paper in the third quarter of in addition  the increase in product asps over the corresponding but lesser increase in cost of sales contributes to the increase in gross profit in as explained above  total sales revenue of corrugating medium and offset printing paper grew in the year ended december   while total cost of sales grew only  thus widening the spread of gross profit in the year of the overall gross profit margin for corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper for the year ended december  increased slightly by  from a year ago to 
because of the increase in product asp during the year as compared to the last year  gross profit margin for corrugating medium paper for the year ended december  was  substantially higher than the gross profit margin for corrugating medium paper for the year of on the other hand  total offset printing paper including finished good papers that we purchased generated a gross profit margin in year as opposed to in the year of  or a decrease of of total sales 
the decrease in the gross profit margin of the offset printing paper in appears to be caused by the relatively low gross profit margin associated with the sales of purchased finished goods pursuant to the supply agreements  which were not effective until august and continue throughout the year of we generated  of gross profit from sales of offset printing paper purchased under the supply agreements during the twelve months ended december   versus  for the last five months in year gross profit margins for the offset printing paper purchased by us during the year ended december  was or for the previous year of and was substantially lower than the gross profit margin of offset printing paper that was manufactured internally 
monthly gross profit margins on the sales of our corrugating medium and offset printing paper for the month period ending december  are as follows 
pgjpg 
gross profit from the sales of digital photo paper for the year ended december  amounted to  or as a percentage to total digital photo paper sales  compared to gross profit of  and gross profit margin of for the previous year 
the gross profit percentage represents a substantial decline as compared to the last year 
this decline is due to our decision to lower the asp as explained above 
we believe the gross profit margin of our digital photo paper has been stabilized and do not expect to see further significant decline in the product asp or the resulting gross profit margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or from  for the comparable period in the decrease was primarily attributable to the large payments of various professional service fees including  more specifically  legal fees incurred in connection with an independent internal investigation conducted by the audit committee of the company and lasted from august to january and a litigation of the shareholder class action as described above in legal proceedings 
for the year ended december   total expenses incurred or accrued for investors relations  legal and accounting auditing fees amounted to   and  respectively as opposed to   and  during the year ended december  income from operations operating income for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase was primarily attributable to the increase in product asps and gross profit of our corrugating medium paper and offset printing paper in year  recovery in the year of from the below normal production caused by the loss of boilers pressure as explained above  growth in gross profit in the amount of  from the digital photo paper operations in year  and a tightened operating expense control and the resulting decrease in general and administrative expenses in year in addition  income from operation for the year ended december  was also negatively impacted by losses from disposition of one corrugating medium paper production line and other facilities in june for a total amount of  in year  loss from disposal of property  plant and equipment amounted to  as we disposed of certain idle equipment and an old employee cafeteria building 
accounts receivable net accounts receivable and trade notes receivable increased by  or to  as of december   compared with  including notes receivable in the amount of  as of december  our year end balance in year was lower than our normal year end or quarter end balance due to a more aggressive collection effort toward the end of the calendar year  a common practice followed by many chinese businesses 
accounts receivable turnover  based on average accounts receivable using balances at the beginning and ending dates of the year and annual sales revenue for the entire year of  decreased from times in year to times in year  while days in accounts receivable increased from days in year to days in year alternatively  accounts receivable turnover calculated using the average quarterly ending balances at the end of first  second  and third quarter of year was times with days in accounts receivable at days 
we usually collect the accounts receivable within days of delivery and completion of sales 
inventory inventory consists of raw materials accounting for of total value of ending inventory as of december  and finished goods 
as of december   the recorded value of our inventory had increased by to  from  as of december  the largest increase came from the inventory item of recycled paperboard  which is the main raw material for the production of our corrugating medium paper  including the operations of the new  tons year production line that expands our corrugating medium paper capacity significantly 
we have also increased the stockpile of the recycled white scrap paper  as we believe the softening of cost for such item in the last two months of year as temporary and as an indication of better timing to build a larger inventory position as of december  we decreased the amount of coal stored on hand to  as of december   as compared to the stock of coal for a total amount of  one year ago 
the average price per ton that we paid for coal in the month of december was approximately ton  which was substantially higher than the average price of translated by the year end spot exchange rate that we paid in the month of december we estimated that the relatively high coal price might not continue to rise significantly in the following months 
therefore we made a decision to lower the coal inventory level at the end of year a summary of changes in major inventory items is as follows december  december  change change raw materials recycled paper board    pulp   recycled printed paper    recycled white scrap paper    coal    digital photo base paper and other raw materials  total raw materials    finished goods    totals    accounts payable accounts payable excluding non inventory purchase payables and accrued expenses was  as of december   an increase of  or from  as of december   due to the following reasons we paid down a large portion of accounts payable for the purchases made in november and december  making the payable balance significantly lower than the normal level  and in preparation for and to sustain the operation of the new corrugating medium paper line  we increased the purchases of recycled paperboard in the last quarter of year all accounts payable as of december  were within the normal payment terms of our suppliers 
comparison of the years ended december  and revenue of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue from sales of offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in nevertheless  total paper sold during the year ended december  amounted to  tons  a decrease of  tons or  compared to  tons sold in the previous year

despite the decrease in sales quantity  average selling price asp for corrugating medium paper rose from ton in year to ton in  representing a increase over the comparable period 
we believe the increase in asp is primarily attributable to increasing customer demand  the overall increased market price caused by relatively high wood pulp prices in the first half of year  and most importantly a regional shortage in paper products supply  caused by mandatory closures of other smaller paper manufacturers under government mandates 
for example  the provincial government of hebei announced on june  that it was working on closing inefficient paper production lines with local paper mills by the end of the year  accounting for an elimination of annual capacity of approximately  tons this year  while the neighboring province of henan announced that it was closing more than local paper mills with an aggregate capacity of over  tons of paper production 
unless further government mandated capacity closure is implemented  we believe the asp of major paper products may stabilize in the first quarter of year beginning in late june  we shut down and later demolished one of our two corrugating medium paper production lines 
we had originally planned to build a new  ton year new corrugating medium paper production line and other facilities on some  square meters of land across the street from our current main manufacturing compound  but due to certain changes in the plan  we decided to instead build the new production line in our current manufacturing compound 
to make room for the new production line and related pulping facilities  we tore down two existing buildings and an existing corrugating medium paper production line 
we estimate the lost capacity could be approximately  tons per year 
the new corrugating medium paper production line started its commercial production in december in connection with the government s approval of our pending new corrugating medium paper production line  the baoding city environmental protection agency required that we replace two of our four steam boilers with new and more energy efficient models 
we removed the two old boilers in july because of the loss of steam pressure  production quantities were lowered during this quarter 
the new boilers were fully installed and inspected by the government in january and were placed in production 
as a partial remedy for the lost production  starting in august the company entered into four offset printing paper supply agreements and one corrugating medium paper supply agreement with paper manufacturers in hebei province and the neighboring shandong province the supply agreements 
these paper supply agreements are all effective through the end of year during year  revenue generated from sales of corrugating medium paper finished goods purchased from these vendors pursuant to the supply agreements was in the amount of  or  tons  representing of annual sales revenue of corrugating medium paper in the year of revenue from medium grade offset printing paper amounted to  or of total offset printing paper and corrugating medium paper revenue for the year ended december   which represents a  or increase over the medium grade offset printing paper revenue of  for the comparable period in since the fourth quarter of  our only white paper based product has been medium grade offset printing paper 
as such  though we sold high grade offset printing paper which uses wood pulp as a raw material in year  there were no sales of high grade offset printing paper or writing paper in the entire year of we sold  tons of medium grade offset printing paper in the year compared to  tons of medium grade offset printing paper in the year  an increase of  tons or 
total white paper high and medium grade  plus writing paper and white card paper sold in the year amounted to  tons  or  versus  tons and  during the same period in while production and sales activities in the second half of were negatively impacted by the loss of two boilers  the factors contributing to the year net increase of  or in total white paper sales revenue include asp for offset printing paper products increased from ton in year to ton in the year  representing an annual increase of  the increase of production in the first half of year from the writing paper production line  which was converted to production of medium grade offset printing paper in  and additional revenue from the sales of offset printing paper finished goods purchased from other paper manufacturers 
out of the total medium grade offset printing paper sales revenue in year   or  tons  or of total medium grade offset printing paper revenue was attributable to sales of medium grade offset printing paper finished goods purchased from other vendors pursuant to the above supply agreements

cost of sales total cost of sales excluding cost of sales of digital photo paper  which was not produced and sold until march for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in the increase in total cost of sales in year is primarily due to the net increased sales revenue in the year relative to the revenue in as explained above  total sales revenue excluding revenue from sales of digital photo paper grew from  in year to  in year  representing a year over year increase 
despite a decrease in tonnage of corrugating medium and offset printing paper products sold in year relative to tonnage sold in year  cost of sales of corrugating medium and offset printing paper per unit became higher in year than in year because of the higher unit cost and therefore  lower sales mark up for the sales of finished goods products purchased from other paper manufacturers under the supply agreements  and the inflated market costs of raw materials and energy in year as opposed to year monthly average purchase costs of our major raw materials for the period of january through december are as follows

except for the purchase cost of recycled paper board  which market price fluctuates depending on various economic factors  costs for the other types of raw materials in the two year period ended december  were on an upward trend and reached the highest point over the period toward the end of year we believe that all of the raw material prices will either remain stable or fluctuate slightly in the next few periods

accounts receivable turnover  based on average accounts receivable using balances at the beginning and ending dates of the year and annual sales revenue for the entire year of  increased from times in year to times in year  while days in accounts receivable decreased from days in year to days in year we  similar to many other chinese business enterprises  tend to accelerate receivable collection toward the end of the calendar year to prepare for the upcoming chinese new year holidays 
therefore  accounts receivable and to a certain extent  the accounts payable balance usually appear lower than the balance during the rest of the year 
alternatively  accounts receivable turnover calculated using the average quarterly ending balances at the end of first  second  and third quarter of year was times with days in accounts receivable at days with comparable accounts receivable turnover and days in accounts receivable being times and days for the year ended december

the large november payable balance was mostly paid down as of december  liquidity and capital resources overview as of december  we had net working capital of  an increase of  over net working capital of  at december  the company finances its daily operations mainly by cash flows generated from its business operations and loans from banking institutions and major shareholders 
major capital expenditures in the year of were primarily financed by cash flows generated from business operations 
as of december  we had approximately  in capital expenditure commitments that were mainly related to the remaining unbilled construction cost of a new corrugating medium paper production line and will be satisfied by payment of cash within the next months 
in addition to the binding contracts that we have entered into  we are considering capital expenditure plans with estimated costs of up to million in the year of these plans include building new production lines of tissue paper that has the capacity of producing  ton of tissue paper per year on the land we are acquiring  if we successfully acquire the land 
within the next months we also intend to complete the acquisition of land that was originally approved by the government for some  square meters 
if the entire  square meters was acquired at the unit price offered as of june  the acquisition would cost approximately  in financial compensation to current land owners and in land use rights from the government 
however  similar to many other recent land acquisition transactions in china  the acquisition process has met significant opposition by some local residents 
these opposing local residents hold various objections to the terms of the acquisition and amount of compensation that we offer 
while the provincial and local governments are fully supportive for the proposed acquisition  it has been a recent trend in china that eminent domain not be exercised under such circumstances for fear of civil unrest 
under these circumstances  we are evaluating the options of acquiring only a portion of the square footage as originally planned  possibly raising the unit price of our compensation offer  or withdrawing from the transaction and seeking other locations following a full refund of the security deposit put down on the  square meters land plot 
as of december   we have pre paid a security deposit of  to the local village council toward the purchase of the land and have taken possession of some  square meters of land 
we expect to consummate a partial closing of an additional  square meters during the second quarter of year and to start the second phase of the acquisition  which involves the application and securing of the land use rights permit 
if we are able to obtain a significant portion of the  square meters  we expect to finance the acquisition with our working capital  net cash inflows generated from business operations in  and if necessary  loans from local banks 
we do not have any firm commitment from the local banks with respect to new credit facilities in addition to all current bank borrowings  which aggregated to approximately  as of december  however  based on the present loan to equity ratio which is less than as of december   we do not believe the company will have problem securing additional bank loans as needed  unless the macroeconomic condition in china changes eg government policies tighten bank credit facilities as a tool to control inflation 
the company currently does not have any plan for equity financing in the next months 
cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents as of december  was  a decrease of  from  as of december  the decrease in year was primarily attributable to a number of factors  including the following i 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or from  for the previous year 
the net income for the year ended december  in the amount of  represented an increase of  or from  for the previous year in in addition to net income  there are certain non cash charges including depreciation in the amount of  that reduced the net income but did not have the effect of reducing the balance of cash and cash equivalents 
except for the increase in ending accounts payable balance  which provide an increase to net cash flow from operating activities  the increase in accounts receivable balances in the amount of  an increase in inventory for  an increase in prepayments mainly due to the large recoverable vat associated with the payments for the construction cost of our new production line in the amount of  and a decrease in other payables and accrued liabilities for  contributed to additional cash outflows from the cash collected from operating activities 
ii 
net cash used in investing activities the company incurred  in cash expenditures for investing activities during the year ended december  these expenditures were mainly for the purchases of new equipment and progress payments for the construction of a new corrugating medium paper production line and ancillary facilities 
the total contract price including related vat for the new corrugating medium paper production equipment  which has an annual capacity of  tons  is  of which only  was unpaid as of december  in addition  cost including related vat of other ancillary facilities for the new corrugating medium paper production line amounted to  such ancillary facilities include  among other things  a new pulping station for a total cost of approximately  and water treatment plant for a total cost of approximately 
we expect to finance any future capital expenditure commitment with our current cash and cash equivalent balance of approximately million  cash flows from operating activities in the next twelve months  and additional bank loans or capital leases  if necessary 
the company made an  land acquisition deposit payment to the local resident s council in june the local resident s council is in charge of the reimbursement and relocation of the residents who occupied the parcel of subject land prior to our interest in acquisition of that land 
unsatisfied with the slow progress of the acquisition  we demanded partial returns of the deposit from the local resident village council in december and received two refunds in the total amount of  in addition to the remaining deposit  to complete the land acquisition at the price we offered as of june  we estimate that the entire land acquisition process will require an additional amount of approximately  based on an estimated total average cost of approximately per square meter of cash payment in the next nine to twelve months 
we expect to pay this amount using future cash flows generated by our operating activities 
as explained above  if we are unable to acquire and close the transaction for at least a meaningful portion of the subject land in the next three months  we may demand the full refund of our deposit from the local resident village council

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk while our reporting currency is the us dollar  almost all of our consolidated revenues and consolidated costs and expenses are denominated in rmb 
all of our assets are denominated in rmb except for some cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign exchange risk as our revenues and results of operations may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between us dollar and rmb 
if the rmb depreciates against the us dollar  the value of our rmb revenues  earnings and assets as expressed in our us dollar financial statements will decline 
we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
inflation although we are generally able to pass along minor incremental cost inflation to our customers  inflationary factors such as increases in the costs of our products and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results 
we do not believe that inflation in china has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date  a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and selling and distribution  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase to cope with these increased costs
