item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general unless the context indicates otherwise  when we refer to we  us  our or the company in this form k  we are referring to guess  inc and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
business segments the company s businesses are grouped into five reportable segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes europe  north american retail  asia  north american wholesale and licensing 
information relating to these segments is summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates segment performance based primarily on revenues and earnings from operations 
the company believes this segment reporting reflects how its five business segments are managed and each segment s performance is evaluated 
the europe segment includes the company s wholesale and retail operations in europe and the middle east 
the north american retail segment includes the company s retail operations in north america 
the asia segment includes the company s wholesale and retail operations in asia 
the north american wholesale segment includes the company s wholesale operations in north america and export sales to central and south america 
the licensing segment includes the worldwide licensing operations of the company 
the business segment operating results exclude corporate overhead costs  which consist of shared costs of the organization 
these costs are presented separately and generally include  among other things  the following unallocated corporate costs information technology  human resources  global advertising and marketing  accounting and finance  executive compensation  facilities and legal 
our international jewelry license agreement  which expired in december  was not renewed as the company decided to directly operate this business going forward 
beginning in january  the operating results of our international jewelry business are included in our europe segment 
prior to that date  we recorded the related royalty income in our licensing segment 
products we derive our net revenue from the sale of guess  guess by marciano  guess kids and g by guess men s and women s apparel  and our licensees products through our worldwide network of retail stores  wholesale customers and distributors  as well as our on line sites 
we also derive royalty revenues from worldwide licensing activities 
recent global economic developments economic and market conditions have become increasingly volatile and uncertain in many markets around the world and consumer behavior remains cautious 
in north america  the relatively weaker levels of consumer confidence and the highly promotional conditions among retailers may persist for some time 
in europe  sovereign debt and bank credit issues continue to affect the capital markets of various european countries and have resulted in reduced consumer confidence and discretionary spending in those countries 
these conditions in europe have begun to affect our business  particularly in the more penetrated countries in southern europe 
the company anticipates that inflationary pressures on raw materials  labor  freight and other commodities including oil  experienced in fiscal may stabilize in the future but continue to negatively impact the cost of product purchases in fiscal  particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 
although overall  the company has been able to mitigate the impact of product inflation through reduced promotional markdowns  price increases on select items and supply chain initiatives  there can be no assurances that these actions will continue to be successful 
in addition  increased retail prices could lead to reduced customer demand 

table of contents we also continue to experience significant volatility in the global currency markets 
since the majority of our international operations are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro  canadian dollar and korean won  currency fluctuations can have a significant impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings into us dollar amounts 
during fiscal  the average us dollar rate was weaker against these currencies versus the average rate in the comparable prior year period 
this had an overall positive impact on the translation of our international revenues and earnings for the year ended january  compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  some of our transactions that occur in europe  canada and south korea are denominated in us dollars  swiss francs and british pounds  exposing them to exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
these transactions include us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise  us dollar and british pound intercompany liabilities and certain sales  operating expenses and tax liabilities denominated in swiss francs 
fluctuations in exchange rates can impact the profitability of our foreign operations and reported earnings and are largely dependent on the transaction timing and magnitude during the period that the currency fluctuates 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain foreign currency transactions 
in addition  some of the derivative contracts in place will create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked to market according to the accounting rules 
based on fluctuations in currency rates during fiscal  the company s results were favorably impacted by the net revaluation of our foreign currency contracts and balances and resulted in a net revaluation gain recorded in other income during fiscal continued volatility in the global currency markets could result in further revaluation gains or losses in future periods 
long term growth strategy despite the difficult economic conditions described above  our key long term strategies remain unchanged 
global expansion continues to be the cornerstone of our long term growth strategy 
our combined revenues outside of the us and canada represented approximately half of the total company s revenues in fiscal  compared to one fifth in fiscal we expect to continue to expand in both our existing european and asian markets 
at the same time  we plan to develop markets in emerging countries like china  brazil  russia and india and expand our g by guess concept both domestically and internationally 
our goal is also to drive growth by enhancing the productivity of our existing operations 
expanding our retail business across the globe is key to executing on our global growth strategy 
we see opportunities to increase the number of guess branded retail stores in europe and asia 
in north america and south korea  we also see store growth opportunities with our g by guess concept 
we will continue to regularly assess and implement initiatives that we believe will build brand equity  grow our business and enhance long term profitability in each region  including investing in advertising and marketing programs to build awareness and drive customer traffic to our stores and websites 
in europe  over the long term  we will continue to focus on developing new markets in northern and eastern europe where our brand is well known but still under penetrated and expand on our success in western and southern europe 
in fiscal  we have made significant progress on developing important european markets such as germany  russia  portugal and the netherlands 
we have flagship stores in key cities such as paris  barcelona  dusseldorf  london and milan 
together with our licensee partners  we opened stores during fiscal and we plan to continue our international expansion in europe by opening approximately retail stores in fiscal  about one third of which will be operated directly by us 
our north american retail growth strategy is to increase retail sales and profitability by expanding our network of retail stores and improving the productivity and performance of existing stores 
we will continue to emphasize our newer g by guess store concept and our e commerce channel 
during fiscal  we opened retail stores and we currently plan to open approximately retail stores across all 
table of contents concepts in the us and canada during fiscal  with roughly half under the g by guess brand 
in addition  we plan to remodel key existing locations as part of the roll out of our new store designs 
in february  we opened our largest flagship store in the world in new york city with over  square feet 
we see significant market opportunities in asia and we are dedicating capital and human resources to support the region s growth and development 
we and our partners opened flagship stores in key cities such as seoul  shanghai  hong kong  macau  taipei and beijing and we have partnered with licensees to develop our business in the second tier cities in this region 
during fiscal  we also launched our newer g by guess store concept in south korea where we have locations as of january  our strategy in south korea  with a combined stores and concessions at january   is to continue to improve productivity and expand distribution for both our guess and g by guess branded locations 
we and our partners opened stores and concessions during fiscal across all of asia and plan to open between and retail stores and concessions combined across all concepts in asia during fiscal the company s investments in capital for the full fiscal year are planned between million and million after deducting estimated lease incentives of approximately million 
the planned investments in capital are primarily for expansion of our retail businesses in north america and europe and store remodeling programs in north america 
other the company reports national retail federation nrf calendar comparable store sales on a quarterly basis for our stores in the us and canada 
a store is considered comparable after it has been open for full months 
if a store remodel results in a square footage change of more than  or involves a relocation or a change in store concept  the store is removed from the comparable store base until it has been opened at its new size  in its new location or under its new concept for full months

in local currency  revenues increased by over the same comparable period 
the increase in reported revenues was driven by expansion of our directly operated retail stores where comparable store sales declined and the favorable currency translation impact resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
this was partially offset by lower net revenues from our european wholesale businesses where higher apparel sales were more than offset by a decline in handbag and jewelry sales

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis including those related to the valuation of inventories  accounts receivable allowances  sales return allowances  loyalty and gift card accruals  the useful life of assets for depreciation  restructuring expense and accruals  evaluation of asset impairment  recoverability of deferred taxes  unrecognized tax benefits  workers compensation and medical self insurance expense and accruals  litigation reserves  pension obligations and share based compensation 
the company believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for other significant accounting policies 

table of contents accounts receivable reserves in the normal course of business  the company grants credit directly to certain wholesale customers after a credit analysis is performed based on financial and other criteria 
accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from the inability of its wholesale customers to make their required payments 
the company bases its allowances on analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of historical collection trends  an evaluation of the impact of current economic conditions and whether the company has obtained credit insurance or other guarantees 
costs associated with customer markdowns are recorded as a reduction to revenues  and any unapplied amounts are included in the allowance for accounts receivable 
historically  these markdown allowances resulted from seasonal negotiations with the company s wholesale customers  as well as historical trends and the evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
sales returns reserves the company accrues for estimated sales returns in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
to recognize the financial impact of sales returns  the company estimates the amount of goods that will be returned based on historical experience and reduces sales and cost of sales accordingly based on historical return experience 
the company s policy allows retail customers in certain regions a grace period to return merchandise following the date of sale 
substantially all of these returns are considered to be resalable at a price that exceeds the cost of the merchandise 
inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost primarily weighted average method or market 
the company continually evaluates its inventories by assessing slow moving product as well as prior seasons inventory 
market value of aged inventory is estimated based on historical sales trends for each product line category  the impact of market trends  an evaluation of economic conditions  available liquidation channels and the value of current orders relating to the future sales of this type of inventory 
the company closely monitors off price sales to ensure the actual results closely match initial estimates 
estimates are regularly updated based upon this continuing review 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets the company assesses the impairment of its long lived assets ie  goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  which requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
an asset is considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon its assessment of the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods or if significant changes in the company s strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets occurred 
if the assets other than goodwill are assessed to be recoverable  they are depreciated or amortized over the periods benefited 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recognized representing the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of those assets 
fair value is determined based upon the discounted cash flows derived from the underlying asset 
we use various assumptions in determining current fair market value of these assets  including future expected cash flows and discount rates 
future expected cash flows for store assets are based on management s estimates of future cash flows over the remaining lease period or expected life  if shorter 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to future impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents pension benefit plan actuarial assumptions the company s pension obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  within the authoritative guidance framework 
the discount rate and estimated future compensation are both important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions annually which enables us to state expected future payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for supplemental executive retirement plan related information 
litigation reserves estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the expected probable favorable or unfavorable outcome of each claim 
as additional information becomes available  the company assesses the potential liability related to new claims and existing claims and revises estimates as appropriate 
as new claims arise or existing claims evolve  such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact the results of operations and financial position 
share based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of authoritative guidance using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized after january  includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used for new grants 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect for the expected term of the option at the time of grant 
the expected volatility is determined based on an average of both historical volatility and implied volatility 
implied volatility is derived from exchange traded options on the company s common stock 
the expected life used prior to november was based on the simplified method described in authoritative guidance 
for options granted beginning november  the expected term is determined based on historical trends 
the dividend yield for and prior years was assumed to be zero since the company had not historically declared and did not have a plan to declare dividends on an ongoing basis until the board of directors authorized and approved the initiation of quarterly dividends in february the expected dividend yield starting from is based on the company s history and expectations of dividend payouts 
the expected forfeiture rate is determined based on historical data 
compensation expense for nonvested stock options and stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
in addition  the company has granted certain nonvested stock awards and stock options in the past that require the recipient to achieve certain minimum performance targets in order for these awards to vest 
if the minimum performance targets have not been achieved or are not expected to be achieved  no expense is recorded during the period 
income taxes the company adopted authoritative guidance in january  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
guidance was also 
table of contents provided on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
the company s continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as required under applicable accounting rules  the company accrues an amount for its estimate of additional income tax liability which the company  more likely than not  could incur as a result of the ultimate resolution of tax audits uncertain tax positions 
the company reviews and updates the estimates used in the accrual for uncertain tax positions as more definitive information becomes available from taxing authorities  upon completion of tax audits  upon expiration of statutes of limitation  or upon occurrence of other events 
the results of operations and financial position for future periods could be impacted by changes in assumptions or resolutions of tax audits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire asset will not be realized 
as all earnings from the company s foreign operations are permanently reinvested and not distributed  the company s income tax provision does not include additional us taxes on foreign operations 
hedge accounting the company operates in foreign countries  which exposes it to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has entered into certain forward contracts to hedge the risk of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the company has elected to apply the hedge accounting rules in accordance with authoritative guidance for certain of these hedges 
the company s objective is to hedge the variability in forecasted cash flows due to the foreign currency risk 
various transactions that occur in canada  europe and south korea are denominated in us dollars  british pounds or swiss francs and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
these types of transactions include us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise and us dollar and british pound intercompany liabilities 
in addition  certain sales  operating expenses and tax liabilities are denominated in swiss francs and are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain of these anticipated foreign currency transactions 
changes in the fair value of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of product sales  sg a or other income and expenses in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold or the hedged operating expense and hedged intercompany liability is incurred 
the company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense 
gift card breakage gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by the company for which a liability was recorded in prior periods 
estimated breakage amounts are accounted for under the redemption recognition method and are classified as additional net revenues as the gift cards are redeemed 
the company determined a gift card breakage rate based upon historical redemption patterns  which represented the cumulative estimated amount of gift card breakage from the 
table of contents inception of the electronic gift card program in late any future revisions to the estimated breakage rate may result in changes in the amount of breakage income recognized in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the recognition of gift card breakage 
loyalty programs the company launched customer loyalty programs for its g by guess  guess and guess by marciano stores in july  august and september  respectively 
the guess and guess by marciano loyalty programs were merged in may under the programs  customers accumulate points based on purchase activity 
once a loyalty program member achieves a certain point level  the member earns awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise 
in all of the programs  unredeemed points generally expire after six months and unredeemed awards generally expire after two months 
due to the relative newness of the programs  prior to fiscal  all unexpired  unredeemed points and awards were accrued in current liabilities and recorded as a reduction of net sales as points and awards were accumulated by the member 
in fiscal  based on the accumulation of multiple cycles of actual redemptions experienced since inception of the programs  the company revised its approach to estimate the value of future award redemptions under the existing loyalty program by incorporating historical redemption rates 
in connection with this revision  the company recorded a cumulative adjustment of million in fiscal to increase net revenue and to adjust the current liability balance to an amount reflecting estimated future award redemptions 
this adjustment had a favorable impact of per share 
the aggregate dollar value of the loyalty program accruals included in accrued liabilities was million and million at january  and january   respectively 
future revisions to the estimated liability may result in changes to net revenue

under that option  an entity would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit if the entity determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its carrying amounts are less than their fair values 
if an entity concludes otherwise  then it must perform the two step impairment test currently required 
the company elected to early adopt this guidance in fiscal the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk more than half of product sales and licensing revenue recorded for the year ended january  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company s primary exchange rate risk relates to operations in europe  canada and south korea 
changes in currencies affect our earnings in various ways 
for further discussion on currency related risk  please refer to our risk factors under part  item a 
risk factors 
various transactions that occur in canada  europe and south korea are denominated in us dollars  british pounds or swiss francs and thus are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to their functional currencies 
these types of transactions include us dollar denominated purchases of merchandise  us dollar and british pound denominated intercompany liabilities and certain sales  operating expenses and tax liabilities denominated in swiss francs that are exposed to earnings risk as a result of exchange rate fluctuations when converted to the functional currency 
the company enters into derivative financial instruments to offset some but not all of the exchange risk on certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
in addition  some of the derivative contracts in place will create volatility during the fiscal year as they are marked to market according to the accounting rules 
forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges during the year ended january   the company purchased us dollar forward contracts in europe and canada totaling us million and us million  respectively  to hedge forecasted merchandise purchases and intercompany royalties that were designated as cash flow hedges 
as of january   the company had forward contracts outstanding for its european and canadian operations of us million and us million  respectively  which are expected to mature over the next months 
the company s derivative financial instruments are recorded in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market rates 
changes in the fair value of the us dollar forward contracts  designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted merchandise purchases  are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  and are recognized in cost of product sales in the period which approximates the time the hedged merchandise inventory is sold 
changes in the fair value of the us dollar forward contracts  designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted intercompany royalties  are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  and are recognized in other income and expense in the period in which the royalty expense is incurred 
from time to time  swiss franc forward contracts have been used in the past to hedge certain anticipated swiss operating expenses over specific months 
changes in the fair value of the swiss franc forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity  and are recognized in sg a in the period which approximates the time the expenses are incurred 
as of january   accumulated other comprehensive income included a net unrealized gain of approximately us million  net of tax  of which us million will be recognized in other income or cost of product sales over the following months at the then current values on a pre tax basis  which can be different than the current year end values 
at january   the net unrealized gain of the remaining open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately us million 
at january   the company had forward contracts outstanding for its european and canadian operations of us million and us million  respectively 
at january   the net unrealized loss of these open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately us million 
the following table summarizes net after tax derivative activity recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in thousands year ended jan 
 year ended jan 
 beginning balance loss gain net gains from changes in cash flow hedges net losses gains reclassified to income ending balance gain loss forward contracts not designated as cash flow hedges the company also has foreign currency contracts that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts not qualifying as cash flow hedges are reported in net earnings as part of other income and expense 
for the year ended january   the company recorded a net gain of us million for the euro  british pound  swiss franc and canadian dollar foreign currency contracts  which has been included in other income and expense 
at january   the company had euro foreign currency contracts to purchase us million expected to mature over the next months  canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase us million expected to mature over the next eight months  swiss franc foreign currency contracts to purchase us million expected to mature over the next nine months and gbp million of foreign currency contracts to purchase euros expected to mature over the next seven months 
at january   the net unrealized gain of these open forward contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately us million 
at january   the company had euro foreign currency contracts to purchase us million  canadian dollar foreign currency contracts to purchase us million  swiss franc foreign currency contracts to purchase us million and gbp million of foreign currency contracts to purchase euros 
at january   the net unrealized loss of these open forward contracts recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet was approximately us million 
sensitivity analysis at january   a sensitivity analysis of changes in the foreign currencies when measured against the us dollar indicates that  if the us dollar had uniformly weakened by against all of the us dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives totaling us million  the fair value of the instruments would have decreased by us million 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all of the us dollar denominated foreign exchange derivatives  the fair value of these instruments would have increased by us million 
any resulting changes in the fair value of the hedged instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities in our foreign operations impacted by the change in the foreign currency rate 
the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle 
interest rate risk at january   approximately of the company s total indebtedness related to a capital lease obligation  which is covered by a separate interest rate swap agreement with a swap fixed interest rate of that matures in changes in the related interest rate that result in an unrealized gain or loss on the fair value of the swap are reported in other income or expense 
the change in the unrealized fair value of the interest swap decreased other income  net by million during fiscal year substantially all of the company s remaining indebtedness is at variable rates of interest 
accordingly  changes in interest rates would impact the company s results of operations in future periods 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect on interest expense for the year ended january  the fair value of the company s debt instruments are based on the amount of future cash flows associated with each instrument discounted using the company s incremental borrowing rate 
at january   the carrying value of all financial instruments was not materially different from fair value  as the interest rate on the company s debt approximates rates currently available to the company
