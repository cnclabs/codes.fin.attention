through that basic concept of connection and community  the company improved our relationships with our clients and enhanced those that were already strong 
direct client feedback and insights into the solution and services portfolio have been invaluable 
through this feedback  our clients have communicated that they believe the company offers a strong value proposition that provides significant cost efficiencies  given our deep and meaningful integration with emr vendors such as ge  cerner  allscripts  meditech and epic 
second  the company is actively working to secure more opportunities that fall within the scope of the capabilities of the solutions set

the company believes that there is a significant opportunity to migrate more current licensed clients to the software as a service model  which will result in a more stable and predictable recurring revenue streams for the company 
on december  accessanyware  our clinical content management system  version became commercially available 
this is not only an important milestone in the transition of the company s core solution  but it also opens the door to accelerate the planning with clients to migrate them to the updated version platform 
as clients transition to version  the company will not only generate available professional services revenue  but we will have the opportunity to sell additional software solutions to those clients to help them improve their operational efficiency and financial results

index to financial statements proprietary software revenues recognized from licensed software sales in fiscal were  as compared to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or from fiscal this decrease is attributable to the market demand shift towards saas  as well as the previously announced decrease in net new client opportunities from ge healthcare 
hardware and third party software revenues from hardware and third party software sales in fiscal were  a decrease of  or from fiscal the decrease in hardware and third party software revenue in fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in hardware and third party upgrades from the existing client base as well as the decrease in new licensed sales  as compared to fiscal professional services revenues from professional services in fiscal year were  a decrease of  or  from fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the timing of which revenue could be recognized based on services performed 
maintenance and support revenues from maintenance and support in fiscal year were  an increase of  or  from fiscal the increase in maintenance and support results from the addition of new or renewed maintenance contracts signed with clients in fiscal  as well as those signed in late fiscal as part of perpetual proprietary license sales 
typically maintenance renewals include a price increase based on the prevailing consumer price index  or increase in the product set purchased by the client

index to financial statements the company relies on ge healthcare for a significant amount of its revenues  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company learned that ge healthcare was shifting its organizational focus to upgrading its current clients to their latest version software to assist its clients in meeting meaningful use criteria under the hitech act 
this understanding continues through january  the company s remarketing agreement with ge healthcare remains in effect  however the company did not obtain any net new clients from the relationship in fiscal the opportunity to sell into ge healthcare s current client base that does not have the company s products remains  as well as the continuing ability to sell additional products and services into the existing jointly owned client base through the remarketing agreement

cost of systems sales  as a percentage of systems sales  varies from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold 
the relatively fixed cost of the capitalized software amortization  without the addition of any impairment charges  compared to the variable nature of system sales causes these percentages to vary dramatically 
the decrease in fiscal cost of sales is primarily the result of the fiscal impairment charge of  on capitalized software development costs on certain workflows 
the remaining decrease is the result of a  decrease in amortization expense  as well as reduced hardware and third party software sales  which reduces the associated direct costs 
the cost of professional services includes compensation and benefits for personnel  and related expenses 
the decrease in expense is primarily due to a significant reduction in staffing which took place in the second 
index to financial statements quarter of fiscal  and significant other cost cutting measures implemented by management 
this was partially offset by an incremental increase in expense of  attributable to the inclusion of interpoint operations 
the cost of maintenance and support includes compensation and benefits for client support personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts 
these decreases are primarily due to a significant reduction in staffing which took place in the second quarter of fiscal  and consolidation or renegotiation of third party maintenance contract associated with supporting the client base 
this was partially offset by incremental increase in expense of  attributable to the inclusion of interpoint operations 
the cost of software as a service is relatively fixed  but subject to inflation for the goods and services it requires 
the decrease is primarily attributable to decreased depreciation due to older assets becoming fully depreciated and a decrease in third party license and maintenance expenses due to consolidation and renegotiation of contracts with vendors 
these decreases are partially offset by depreciation of new equipment and new third party maintenance contracts from infrastructure spending as the company added new or add on saas contracts in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal this decrease was partially offset by incremental increase in expense of  attributable to the inclusion of interpoint operations 
selling  general and administrative expense fiscal year in thousands change change general and administrative expenses sales and marketing expenses selling  general  and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits and reimbursable travel and living expenses related to the company s executive and administrative staff  general corporate expenses  amortization of intangible assets  and occupancy costs 
the increase over the prior year is primarily due to increases in professional fees  equity awards expense  accrued vacation expense  and is partially offset by reductions in severance costs  and reductions in use of third party contractors 
amortization of intangible assets added incremental expense to fiscal due to the amortization of assets acquired as part of the acquisition of interpoint 
excluding the impact of the interpoint acquisition  general and administrative expenses would be  or of total revenue for fiscal sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits and reimbursable travel and living expenses related to the company s sales and marketing staff  advertising and marketing expenses  including trade shows and similar type sales and marketing expenses

the tax provision of  for fiscal consists of state and local taxes  alternative minimum tax  and an increase to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in the amount of  the company determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax amount will be realized 
at january  and the net realizable value of deferred tax assets was  backlog company proprietary software hardware and third party software professional services maintenance and support software as a service total at january  the company had master agreements and purchase orders from clients and remarketing partners for systems and related services which have not been delivered or installed which  if fully performed  would generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january  the company s proprietary software backlog consists of signed agreements to purchase software licenses 
typically  this is software that is not yet generally available  or the software is generally available and the client has not taken possession of the software 
third party hardware and software consists of signed agreements to purchase third party hardware or third party software licenses that have not been delivered to the client 
these are products that the company resells as components of the solution a client purchases 
the increase in backlog is primarily due to three clients which have made purchases for future systems implementations 
these items are expected to be delivered in the next twelve months as implementations commence 

index to financial statements professional services backlog consists of signed contracts for services that have yet to be performed 
typically backlog is recognized within twelve months of the contract signing 
the increase in backlog is due to several clients that signed contracts during fiscal for add on solutions  upgrades  or expansion of services at additional locations for which contracted services have not yet been performed 
maintenance and support backlog consists of maintenance agreements for licenses of the company s proprietary software and third party hardware and software with clients and remarketing partners for which either an agreement has been signed  a purchase order under a master agreement has been received  or payment has been received 
the company includes in backlog the signed agreements through their respective renewal dates 
typical maintenance contracts are for a one year term and are renewed annually 
clients typically prepay maintenance and support which is billed days prior to the beginning of the maintenance period 
the company does not expect any significant client attrition over the next months 
maintenance and support backlog at january  was  as compared to  at january  the company expects to recognize approximately  out of january  backlog in fiscal a significant portion of the increase in maintenance and support backlog is due to one client which signed an extended maintenance contract for five years 
this five year agreement added approximately  to backlog at january   for which the company expects to recognize approximately  in fiscal  and the remaining  in fiscal through fiscal other factors which increased backlog are add on solutions sold in fiscal and those sold in late fiscal for which maintenance revenue was recognized for a full year in fiscal additionally  as part of renewals contracts are typically subject to an annual increase in fees based on market rates and inflationary metrics 
at january   the company had entered into software as a service agreements  which are expected to generate revenues of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years through typical saas terms are one to seven years in length 
saas backlog and terms are as follows in thousands saas backlog at january  average remaining months in term year term year term year term less than year term total saas backlog these contracts are primarily clients either acquired as part of the interpoint acquisition or were signed subsequent to the acquisition at december  the commencement of revenue recognition for saas varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the client and ultimately the official go live on the system 
therefore  it is difficult for the company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
all of the company s master agreements generally provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by the company  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a client will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay portions of the agreement 
a termination or delay in one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of the company to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  and results of operations 
use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board of directors in its financial and operational decision making  the 
index to financial statements company may supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following non gaap financial measures ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and adjusted ebitda margin 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap 
the company compensates for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only as supplemental data 
we also provide a reconciliation of non gaap to gaap measures used 
investors are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by the company  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share the company defines i ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net income loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense  iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue  and iv adjusted ebitda per diluted share as adjusted ebitda divided by adjusted diluted shares outstanding 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share are used to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing the company s operating performance consistently over time as they remove the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization and items outside the control of the management team taxes 
adjusted ebitda removes the impact of share based compensation expense  which is another non cash item outside of management control 
adjusted ebitda per diluted share will include incremental shares in the share count that would be considered anti dilutive in a gaap net loss position 
the board of directors and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive and associate incentive compensation programs 
the company s lenders use adjusted ebitda to assess our operating performance 
the company s credit agreements with its lender require delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is the same as the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and board of directors 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities  despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share as disclosed in this annual report on form k  have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda  and its variations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  
index to financial statements ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  the company encourages readers to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
the company also strongly urges readers to review the reconciliation of gaap net earnings loss to adjusted ebitda  and gaap earnings loss per diluted share to adjusted ebitda per diluted share in this section  along with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  a comparable gaap based measure  as well as earnings loss per diluted share to adjusted ebitda per diluted share 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net earnings loss to ebitda to adjusted ebitda and the related per share calculations are either recurring non cash items  or items that management does not consider in assessing the company s on going operating performance 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company s comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company s operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 

index to financial statements the following table reconciles net earnings loss to ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share for the fiscal years ended january  and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal year adjusted ebitda reconciliation net earnings loss interest expense tax expenses depreciation amortization of capitalized software development costs amortization of intangible assets ebitda stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda per diluted share earnings loss per share diluted adjusted ebitda per adjusted diluted share diluted weighted average shares includable incremental shares adjusted ebitda adjusted diluted shares fiscal includes a non cash increase to the valuation allowance of  fiscal amortization expense includes  of impairment charges for certain capitalized software development costs adjusted ebitda as a percentage of gaap revenues the number of incremental shares that would be dilutive under profit assumption  only applicable under a gaap net loss 
if gaap profit is earned in the current period  no additional incremental shares are assumed application of critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies 
see note b of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition and asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the company commences revenue recognition when the following criteria all have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  
index to financial statements delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable if the company determines that any of the above criteria has not been met  the company will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria  cancellation or right of refund terms are required  revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such criteria  as applicable 
multiple element arrangements on february   we adopted accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu on a prospective basis 
the company follows accounting guidance for revenue recognition of multiple deliverable revenue arrangements meaning the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets to determine whether such arrangements contain more than one unit of accounting 
to qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the delivered item must have value to the client on a stand alone basis meaning the item can be sold separately by any vendor or the client could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
additionally  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items must be considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed the company for solutions and services provided 
contracts with individual clients and resellers determine when receivables are due and payable 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  the unpaid receivables are reviewed monthly to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables 
during these monthly reviews  the company determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its clients or resellers to make required payments 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with asc software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
once technological feasibility has been determined  a portion of the costs incurred in development  including coding  testing  and quality assurance  are capitalized until available for general release to clients  and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value
