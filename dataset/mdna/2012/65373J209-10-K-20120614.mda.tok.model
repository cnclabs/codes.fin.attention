table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nicholas financial canada is a canadian holding company incorporated under the laws of british columbia in nicholas financial canada conducts its business activities through two wholly owned florida corporations nicholas financial  which purchases and services contracts  makes direct loans and sells consumer finance related products  and nds  which supports and updates certain computer application software 
nicholas financial accounted for more than of the company s consolidated revenue for each of the fiscal years ended march    and nicholas financial canada  nicholas financial and nicholas data services are collectively referred to herein as the company 
the company s consolidated revenues increased for the fiscal year ended march  to million as compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company s consolidated net income increased for the fiscal year ended march  to million as compared to million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the company s earnings were positively impacted by a decrease in the net charge off percentage to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the company believes the decrease in the charge off percentage was primarily attributable to the following factors a temporary reduction in competition  the increased market value of auctioned cars  the continued application of stricter underwriting guidelines  and the continued allocation of additional resources focused on collections 
the consumer assistance to recycle and save act of cars established a voluntary vehicle trade in and purchase program pursuant to which owners of vehicles were eligible to receive a credit of either  or  in connection with the purchase of a new vehicle from a participating dealer  depending upon how the trade in and acquired vehicles fit within the program criteria  including the amount of improved fuel efficiency 
the program reduced the supply of used cars in the market  resulting in increases in the market value of used cars in subsequent years  especially for older used cars such as those financed by contracts held by the company 
the company s underwriting guidelines were changed in to increase the minimum income required by any applicant before loan approval can even be contemplated 
the company also reduced the maximum advance to any dealer  raised the minimum enh beacon score  and reduced the maximum amount that can be financed 
during the latter part of fiscal year the company began experiencing increased competition which has continued into the first quarter of fiscal historically  when competition has increased  the company has experienced higher losses  decreased contract origination and as a result reduced profits 
while it is difficult to predict the level of competition long term  the company believes the current competitive environment will be prevalent throughout fiscal portfolio summary fiscal year ended march  average finance receivables  net of unearned interest average indebtedness interest and fee income on finance receivables interest expense net interest and fee income on finance receivables weighted average contractual rate average cost of borrowed funds gross portfolio yield interest expense as a percentage of average finance receivables  net of unearned interest provision for credit losses as a percentage of average finance receivables  net of unearned interest net portfolio yield marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation and administrative expenses as a percentage of average finance receivables  net of unearned interest pre tax yield as a percentage of average finance receivables  net of unearned interest write off to liquidation net charge off percentage

critical accounting policy the company s critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for credit losses 
it is based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for credit losses is established through allocations of dealer discounts and a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired loans and current economic conditions 
such evaluation considers  among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate credit loss allowance 
because of the nature of the customers under the company s contracts and its direct loan program  the company considers the establishment of adequate reserves for credit losses to be imperative 
the company segregates its contracts into static pools for purposes of establishing reserves for losses 
all contracts purchased by a branch during a fiscal quarter comprise a static pool 
the company pools contracts according to branch location because the branches purchase contracts in different geographic markets 
this method of pooling by branch and quarter allows the company to evaluate the different markets where the branches operate 
the pools also allow the company to evaluate the different levels of customer income  stability and credit history  and the types of vehicles purchased in each market 
each such static pool consists of the contracts purchased by a branch office during a fiscal quarter 
contracts are purchased from many different dealers and are all purchased on an individual contract by contract basis 
individual contract pricing is determined by the automobile dealerships and is generally the lesser of the applicable state maximum interest rate  if any  or the maximum interest rate which the customer will accept 
in certain markets  competitive forces will drive down contract rates from the maximum rate to a level where an individual competitor is willing to buy an individual contract 
the company only buys contracts on an individual basis and never purchases contracts in batches  although the company may consider portfolio acquisitions as part of its growth strategy 
see item business growth strategy 
the company has detailed underwriting guidelines it utilizes to determine which contracts to purchase 
these guidelines are specific and are designed to cause all of the contracts that the company purchases to have common risk characteristics 
the company utilizes its district managers to evaluate their respective branch locations for adherence to these underwriting guidelines 
the company also utilizes an internal audit department to assure adherence to its underwriting guidelines 
the company utilizes the branch model  which allows for contract purchasing to be done on the branch level 
each branch manager may interpret the guidelines differently  and as a result  the common risk characteristics tend to be the same on an individual branch level but not necessarily compared to another branch 
a dealer discount represents the difference between the finance receivable  net of unearned interest  of a contract  and the amount of money the company actually pays for the contract 
the discount negotiated by the company is a function of the credit quality of the customer  the wholesale value of the vehicle  and competition in any given market 
the automotive dealer accepts these terms by executing a dealer agreement with the company 
the entire amount of discount is related to credit quality and is considered to be part of the allowance for credit losses 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to track portfolio performance 
a static pool retains an amount equal to of the discount as an allowance for credit losses 

table of contents subsequent to the purchase  if the reserve for credit losses is determined to be inadequate for a static pool which is not fully liquidated  then an additional charge to income through the provision is used to reestablish adequate reserves 
if a static pool is fully liquidated and has any remaining reserves  the excess discounts are immediately recognized into income and the excess provision is immediately reversed during the period 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are determined to have excess discounts  such excess amounts are accreted into income over the remaining life of the static pool 
for static pools not fully liquidated that are deemed to have excess reserves  such excess amounts are reversed against provision for credit losses during the period 
in analyzing a static pool  the company considers the performance of prior static pools originated by the branch office  the performance of prior contracts purchased from the dealers whose contracts are included in the current static pool  the credit rating of the customers under the contracts in the static pool  and current market and economic conditions 
each static pool is analyzed monthly to determine if the loss reserves are adequate  and adjustments are made if they are determined to be necessary 
fiscal compared to fiscal interest and fee income on finance receivables interest income on finance receivables  predominantly finance charge income  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the average finance receivables  net of unearned interest  totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from million for the fiscal year ended march  the primary reason average finance receivables  net of unearned interest  increased was the development of new markets in missouri  south carolina  ohio  and alabama 
the gross finance receivable balance increased to million at march  from million at march  the primary reason interest income increased was the increase in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the gross portfolio yield decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the net portfolio yield increased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the gross portfolio yield remained relatively flat primarily due to an unchanged weighted apr earned on finance receivables 
the net portfolio yield increased primarily due to the decrease in provisions for credit losses 
the company has experienced favorable variances between projected write offs and actual write offs on certain pools which has resulted in an increase in expected future cash flows 
accordingly  the amount of additional provision necessary to maintain an adequate allowance to absorb losses in the existing portfolio was less than the provision in fiscal as a result  the provision for credit losses was less than write offs during the current periods 
more specifically  during the th quarter of fiscal actual losses were considerably lower than expected along with auction prices of repossessed vehicles at historically high levels 
marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation  and administrative expenses marketing  salaries  employee benefits  depreciation  and administrative expenses increased to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march  this increase of was primarily attributable to additional staffing at existing branches

under the new line  the company s credit facility pricing changed from basis points above day libor to basis points above day libor  with a floor on libor 
the average cost of borrowings in future periods will continue to be impacted by such pricing increases

the provision for credit losses decreased to  for the fiscal year ended march  from million for the fiscal year ended march   largely due to the fact that net charge offs during fiscal were less than the expected charge offs previously contemplated in the allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the amount of additional provision necessary to maintain an adequate allowance to absorb losses in the existing portfolio was less than the provision for prior periods 
the company s losses as a percentage of liquidation decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  the company experienced improvements in the quality of its contracts in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an increase in auction prices  and an increased focus on collections 
increased auction proceeds from repossessed vehicles reduced the amount of the write off which  in turn  lowered the write off to liquidation percentage 
during the fiscal years ended march    and  auction proceeds from the sale of repossessed vehicles averaged approximately   and  respectively  of the related principal balance 
recoveries as a percentage of charge offs were approximately and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
historically  recoveries as a percentage of charge offs have fluctuated from period to period  and the company does not attribute this decrease to any particular change in operational strategy or economic event 
the delinquency percentage for contracts more than thirty days past due as of march  increased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage for direct loans more than thirty days past due as of march  decreased to from as of march  the delinquency percentage increases reflect portfolio weakness that generally manifests itself in increased future losses 
the company utilizes a static pool approach to analyzing portfolio performance and looks at specific static pool performance and recent trends as leading indicators of the future performance of its portfolio 

table of contents the company considers the following factors to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels unemployment rates  competition  the number of bankruptcy filings  the results of internal branch audits  consumer sentiment  consumer spending  economic growth ie  changes in gdp  the condition of the housing sector  and other leading economic indicators 
the company continues to evaluate reserve levels on a pool by pool basis during each reporting period 
while unemployment rates have stabilized  somewhat  they remain elevated  which will make it difficult for additional improvement in loss rates 
the longer term outlook for portfolio performance will depend on overall economic conditions  the unemployment rate  the rationale or irrational behavior of the company s competitors  and the company s ability to monitor  manage and implement its underwriting philosophy in additional geographic areas as it strives to continue its expansion 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year primarily as a result of higher pretax income

the company s effective tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the primary reason for this increase was an increase in the amount of taxable income subject to higher graduated federal income tax rates 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company s cash flows are summarized as follows fiscal year ended march  cash provided by used in operations investing activities primarily purchases of contracts financing activities net decrease increase in cash the company s primary use of working capital during the fiscal year ended march  was the funding of purchases of contracts which purchases are financed substantially through borrowings under the company s line 
on september   the company increased the size of the line and extended the maturity date to november  the line is secured by all of the assets of the company 
the company may borrow up to million under the line 
borrowings under the line may be made under various libor pricing options but typically day libor plus basis points with a floor on libor 
as of march   the amount outstanding under the line was approximately million and the amount available under the line was approximately million 
the company will continue to depend on the availability of the line  together with cash from operations  to finance future operations 
amounts outstanding under the line decreased by million as of march  as compared to march  and increased by approximately million as of march  as compared to march  the decrease in borrowings under the line as of the end of fiscal resulted primarily from the fact that cash received from operations exceeded cash needed to fund new contracts 
the amount of debt the company incurs from time to time under these financing mechanisms depends on the company s need for cash and ability to borrow under the terms of the line 
the company believes that borrowings available under the line as well as cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short term funding needs 
the line requires compliance with certain debt covenants including financial ratios  asset quality and other performance tests 
the company is currently in compliance with all of its debt covenants but  during the current economic slowdown  a breach of one or more of these covenants could occur prior to the maturity date of the line  which is november  the company s consortium of lenders could place the company in default if certain covenants were breached and take one or more of the following actions increase the company s borrowing costs  restrict the company s ability to obtain additional borrowings under the line  accelerate all amounts outstanding under the line  or enforce its interests against collateral securing the line 
although the company believes that its lenders would continue to allow it to operate in the event of a condition of default  no assurances can be given in this regard 
during the fiscal year ended march   three quarterly dividends were declared and paid 
on august   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on september  on october   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on december  on january   the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on march  subsequent to the end of fiscal  the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock payable on june  the company intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future  provided its future earnings meet expectations 
any payment of future cash dividends and the amounts thereof will be dependent upon the company s earnings  financial and other covenants under the line  and other factors deemed relevant by the company s board of directors 
impact of inflation the company is affected by inflation primarily through increased operating costs and expenses including increases in interest rates 
inflationary pressures on operating costs and expenses historically have been largely offset by the company s continued emphasis on stringent operating and cost controls  although no assurances can be given regarding the company s ability to offset the effects of inflation in the future 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s material obligations as of march  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases line of credit interest on line of credit total the company s current line matures on november  interest on outstanding borrowings under the line as of march  is based on an effective interest rate of 
the effective interest rate used in the above table does not contemplate the possibility of entering into interest rate swap agreements in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor does it hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk management seeks to minimize the company s cost of borrowing and may do so through an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate swap agreements  historically were used  and may be used again in the future  for the purpose of managing fluctuating interest rate exposures that exist from ongoing business operations 
the company has not used  and will not use  interest rate swaps for speculative purposes 
a hypothetical change in the interest rate applicable to the borrowings outstanding at fiscal year end would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of  per year before income taxes  assuming the same level of borrowings
