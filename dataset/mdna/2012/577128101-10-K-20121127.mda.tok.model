this strategy consists of the following internal growth which includes organic growth  cost structure and productivity improvements  new product development and the expansion into new markets with existing products  acquisitions and share repurchases under the company s stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources 
the company s results for fiscal were impacted by several significant factors  including the impact of the decline in us deaths on sales of bronze memorial and casket products  a slow down in our european markets including a recent further decline in the value of the euro  an erp implementation in our cemetery products segment 
many of these challenges are expected to continue in fiscal as a result  the company initiated more aggressive cost reduction programs and accelerated initiatives to resolve the remaining erp implementation issues  which resulted in additional one time costs in the fiscal fourth quarter 
these initiatives are progressing well but are still ongoing  which will result in further unusual costs during fiscal however  demand for the products and services of our merchandising solutions and marking and fulfillment systems businesses remained solid through fiscal cremation equipment sales volume also continued to grow domestically 
these trends are expected to continue 
based on the aforementioned  excluding unusual costs  the company is projecting growth in fiscal earnings per share over fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience  economic conditions  and in some cases  actuarial techniques 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
a discussion of market risks affecting the company can be found in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  of this annual report on form k 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide useful and reliable financial information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the following accounting policies involve significant estimates  which were considered critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts 
trade credit is generally extended on a short term basis  thus trade receivables do not bear interest  although a finance charge may be applied to such receivables that are more than days past due 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an evaluation of specific customer accounts for which available facts and circumstances indicate collectibility may be uncertain 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve for all customers based on historical collection experience 
item management s discussion and analysis  continued long lived assets property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets are carried at cost 
depreciation on property  plant and equipment is computed primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by evaluating the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to periodic review for impairment 
in general  when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss must be recognized 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the company uses a combination of valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  unless such lives are considered to be indefinite 
a significant decline in cash flows generated from these assets may result in a write down of the carrying values of the related assets 
the company performed its annual impairment reviews in the second quarters of fiscal  and and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill or other intangibles with indefinite lives were necessary at those times 
share based payment stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
pension and postretirement benefits pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets  the expected return on plan assets and changes in the selected discount rate will affect the amount of pension cost 
the company s principal pension plan maintains a substantial portion of its assets in equity securities in accordance with the investment policy established by the company s pension board 
based on an analysis of the historical performance of the plan s assets and information provided by its independent investment advisor  the company set the long term rate of return assumption for these assets at at september  for purposes of determining pension cost and funded status 
the company s discount rate assumption used in determining the present value of the projected benefit obligation is based upon published indices as of september  and september  for the fiscal year end valuation 
the discount rate was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
environmental environmental liabilities are recorded when the company s obligation is probable and reasonably estimable 
accruals for losses from environmental remediation obligations do not consider the effects of inflation and anticipated expenditures are not discounted to their present value 
item management s discussion and analysis  continued revenue recognition revenues are generally recognized when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is typically at the time of product shipment 
for pre need sales of memorials and vases  revenue is recognized when the memorial has been manufactured to the customer s specifications eg  name and birth date  title has been transferred to the customer and the memorial and vase are placed in storage for future delivery 
a liability has been recorded for the estimated costs of finishing pre need bronze memorials and vases that have been manufactured and placed in storage prior to july  for future delivery 
beginning july   revenue is deferred by the company on the portion of pre need sales attributable to the final finishing and storage of the pre need merchandise 
deferred revenue for final finishing is recognized at the time the pre need merchandise is finished and shipped to the customer 
deferred revenue related to storage is recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated average time that pre need merchandise is held in storage 
at september   the company held  memorials and  vases in its storage facilities under the pre need sales program 
construction revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the cost to cost method

the company has recorded an estimate of million in arrangement with noncontrolling interest on the september  consolidated balance sheet representing the current estimate of the future purchase price 
the timing of the exercise of the put and call provisions is not presently determinable 
unrecognized tax benefits are positions taken  or expected to be taken  on an income tax return that may result in additional payments to tax authorities 
if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken  or expected to be taken  or the applicable statute of limitations expires  then additional payments will not be necessary 
as of september   the company had unrecognized tax benefits  excluding penalties and interest  of approximately million 
the timing of potential future payments related to the unrecognized tax benefits is not presently determinable 
inflation except for the volatility in the cost of bronze ingot  steel and fuel see results of operations  inflation has not had a material impact on the company over the past three years nor is it anticipated to have a material impact for the foreseeable future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the guidance for goodwill and other intangibles

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company has market risk related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not generally use derivative financial instruments in connection with these market risks  except as noted below 
interest rates the company s most significant long term debt instrument is the domestic revolving credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates based on libor 
the company has entered into the following interest rate swaps effective date amount fixed interest rate interest rate spread at september  maturity date may million may october million october november million november march million march june million june august million june september million december september million march november million november the interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the future variable interest payments under the revolving credit facility which are considered probable of occurring 
based on the company s assessment  all the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments  and as such  these hedges were considered highly effective 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected an unrealized loss of million million after tax at september  that is included in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
a decrease of in market interest rates eg a decrease from to would result in an increase of approximately million in the fair value liability of the interest rate swaps 
commodity price risks in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to commodity price fluctuations related to the purchases of certain materials and supplies such as bronze ingot  steel  fuel and wood used in its manufacturing operations 
the company obtains competitive prices for materials and supplies when available 
in addition  based on competitive market conditions and to the extent that the company has established pricing terms with customers through contracts or similar arrangements  the company s ability to immediately increase the price of its products to offset the increased costs may be limited

the fair value of plan assets and discount rate are point in time measures  and the recent volatility of the debt and equity markets makes estimating future changes in fair value of plan assets and discount rates more challenging

impact of changes in actuarial assumptions change in discount rate change in expected return change in market value of assets dollar amounts in thousands increase decrease in net benefit cost increase decrease in projected benefit obligation increase decrease in funded status
