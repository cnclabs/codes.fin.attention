on june   the company executed a new credit agreement with its lenders 
this short term credit facility provides the company borrowing availability up to million with the option to increase to million 
this agreement allows the company  at its option  to borrow funds at the libor rate plus the applicable interest rate spread at december  or at the bank s prime lending rate at december  
this agreement expires in june at december   the company did not have any outstanding balance on this line of credit 
the weighted average interest rate paid by the company was during fiscal year this agreement contains certain loan covenants including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
in july  this agreement was amended to exclude specific non recurring charges recorded by the company in the second quarter of from all debt covenant calculations in and through june  the company is in compliance with these amended covenants at december  this credit facility is secured by certain assets of the company 
the company borrowed million under an unsecured term loan agreement  in connection with a prior business acquisition

the terms and conditions of the line of credit agreement described in the preceding paragraph also apply to the term loan 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement associated with the above million loan  with principal and interest payments due through august at december   the notional principal amount totaled million 
this instrument was utilized by the company to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
the company did not adopt hedge accounting  but rather records the fair market value adjustments through the consolidated statements of operations each period

the company has a million mortgage loan  collateralized by certain real estate 
the annual mortgage payment including interest totals  the mortgage bears interest at a fixed rate of and matures in the company s future principal payments under its term loan  mortgage and operating leases are as follows in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations operating lease total during fiscal year  the company anticipates its capital requirements will not exceed approximately million 
the company does not usually enter into long term contracts with its major hospitality segment customers 
the company commits to purchasing inventory from its suppliers based on a combination of internal forecasts and actual orders from customers 
this process  along with good relations with suppliers  minimizes the working capital investment required by the company 
although the company lists two major customers  mcdonald s and yum brands  it sells to hundreds of individual franchisees of these corporations  each of which is individually responsible for its own debts 
these broadly made sales substantially reduce the impact on the company s liquidity if one individual franchisee reduces the volume of its purchases from the company in a given year 
the company  based on internal forecasts  believes its existing cash  line of credit facilities and its anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through the next twelve months 
however  the company may be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding prior to that time 
the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors including its rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  potential growth through strategic acquisition  expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and market acceptance of its products 
the company cannot assure additional equity or debt financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
the company s sources of liquidity beyond twelve months  in management s opinion  will be its cash balances on hand at that time  funds provided by operations  funds available through its lines of credit and the long term credit facilities that it can arrange 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires the use of estimates  assumptions  judgments and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
the company believes its use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to gaap and are consistently applied 
valuations based on estimates are reviewed for reasonableness and adequacy on a consistent basis throughout the company 
primary areas where financial information of the company is subject to the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment include revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  and taxes 
revenue recognition policy product revenues consist of sales of the company s standard point of sale and property management systems of the hospitality segment 
product revenues include both hardware and software sales 
the company also records service revenues relating to its standard point of sale and property management systems of the hospitality segment 
hardware revenue recognition on hardware sales occurs upon delivery to the customer site or when shipped for systems that are not installed by the company when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
software revenue recognition on software sales generally occurs upon delivery to the customer site or when shipped for systems that are not installed by the company  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
for software sales where the company is the sole party that has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when the system is ready to go live 
service service revenue consists of installation and training services  support maintenance  and field and depot repair 
installation and training service revenue are based upon standard hourly daily rates  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
support maintenance and field and depot repair are provided to customers either on a time and materials basis or under a maintenance contract 
services provided on a time and materials basis are recognized as the services are performed 
service revenues from maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue when billed to the customer and are recognized ratably over the underlying contract period 
the individual product and service offerings that are included in arrangements with our customers are identified and priced separately to the customer based upon the stand alone price for each individual product or service sold in the arrangement irrespective of the combination of products and services which are included in a particular arrangement 
as such  the units of accounting are based on each individual product and service sold  and revenue is allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe of fair value for each individual product and service is based on separate individual prices of these products and services 
the sales price used to establish fair value is the sales price of the element when it is sold individually in a separate arrangement and not as a separate element in a multiple element arrangement 
contracts the company s contract revenues generated by the government segment result primarily from contract services performed for the us government under a variety of cost plus fixed fee  time and material  and fixed price contracts 
revenue on cost plus fixed fee contracts is recognized based on allowable costs for labor hours delivered  as well as other allowable costs plus the applicable fee 
revenue on time and material contracts is recognized by multiplying the number of direct labor hours delivered in the performance of the contract by the contract billing rates and adding other direct costs as incurred 
revenue from fixed price contracts is recognized as labor hours are delivered  which approximates the straight line basis of the life of the contract 
the company s obligation under these contracts is to provide labor hours to conduct research or to staff facilities with no other deliverables or performance obligations 
anticipated losses on all contracts are recorded in full when identified 
unbilled accounts receivable are stated in the company s consolidated financial statements at their estimated realizable value 
contract costs  including indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment through negotiations between the company and us government representatives 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of probable losses related to accounts receivable balances 
the establishment of allowances requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding probable losses on receivable balances 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
thus  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
inventories the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company uses certain estimates and judgments and considers several factors including product demand  changes in customer requirements and changes in technology to provide for excess and obsolescence reserves to properly value inventory 
capitalized software development costs the company capitalizes certain costs related to the development of computer software used in its hospitality segment 
software development costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated economic life when the product is available for general release to customers 
goodwill the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
the company operates in two business segments  hospitality and government 
goodwill impairment testing is performed at the sub segment level referred to as a reporting unit 
the three reporting units utilized by the company for its impairment testing are restaurant  hotel resort spa  and government 
goodwill is assigned to a specific reporting unit at the date the goodwill is initially recorded 
once goodwill has been assigned to a specific reporting unit  it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition  and all of the activities within a reporting unit  whether acquired or organically grown  are available to support the value of the goodwill 
goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  applicable goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds fair value  there is an indication of impairment  at which time a second step would be performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment 
during the second quarter of  the company determined as a result of the decline in the stock price that occurred during the second quarter  a goodwill impairment triggering event had occurred 
the fair value of the company s common shares declined from per share at april  to per share at june   resulting in the company no longer being able to reconcile the aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its market capitalization after consideration of a reasonable control premium 
although there was no significant adverse change to the long term financial outlook of any of its businesses  the company concluded a triggering event had occurred and as a result  performed additional analyses over the valuation of its reporting units in accordance with the relevant accounting rules  recording a non cash impairment charge of million to its goodwill in the second quarter of in addition  as part of this goodwill triggering event assessment  the company recorded an impairment charge of  associated with its indefinite lived intangible assets 
following the impairment charges  the restaurant reporting unit did not carry any residual goodwill  while the hotel resort spa reporting unit s remaining goodwill was million 
the fair value of the government reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value  therefore  no goodwill impairment was noted 
the company utilizes three methodologies in performing its goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit 
these methodologies include both an income approach  namely a discounted cash flow method  and two market approaches  namely the guideline public company method and quoted price method 
the discounted cash flow method was weighted in the fair value calculation  while the public company method and quoted price method were weighted each at of the fair value calculation 
the valuation methodologies and weightings used in the current year are generally consistent with those used in the company s past annual impairment tests 
the discounted cash flow method derives a value by determining the present value of a projected level of income stream  including a terminal value 
this method involves the present value of a series of estimated future cash flows at the valuation date by the application of a discount rate  one which a prudent investor would require before making an investment in the equity of the company 
the company considers this method to be most reflective of a market participant s view of fair value given the current market conditions  as it is based on the company s forecasted results and  therefore  established its weighting at of the fair value calculation 
key assumptions within the company s discounted cash flow model utilized for its annual impairment test included projected financial operating results  a long term growth rate of beyond five years and discount rates ranging from to  depending on the reporting unit 
as stated above  as the discounted cash flow method derives value from the present value of a projected level of income stream  a modification to the company s projected operating results including changes to the long term growth rate could impact the fair value 
the present value of the cash flows is determined using a discount rate based on the capital structure and capital costs of comparable public companies  as well as company specific risk premium  as identified by the company 
a change to the discount rate could impact the fair value determination 
the market approach is a generally accepted way of determining a value indication of a business  business ownership interest  security or intangible asset by using one or more methods that compare the subject to similar businesses  business ownership interests  securities or intangible assets that have been sold 
there are two methodologies considered under the market approach the public company method and the quoted price method 
the public company method and quoted price method of appraisal are based on the premise that pricing multiples of publicly traded companies can be used as a tool to be applied in valuing closely held companies 
the mechanics of the method require the use of the stock price in conjunction with other factors to create a pricing multiple that can be used  with certain adjustments  to apply against the subject s similar factor to determine an estimate of value for the subject company 
the company considered these methods appropriate as they provide an indication of fair value as supported by current market conditions 
the company established its weighting at of the fair value calculation for each method 
the most critical assumption underlying the market approaches utilized by the company are the comparable companies utilized 
each market approach described above estimates revenue and earnings multiples for the company based on its comparable companies 
as such  a change to the comparable companies could have an impact on the fair value determination 
the amount of goodwill carried by the hotel resort spa and government reporting units is million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair value of the hotel resort spa reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 
the estimated fair value of the government reporting unit is substantially in excess of its carrying value 
hotel resort spa in deriving its fair value estimates  the company has utilized key assumptions built on the current core business adjusted to reflect anticipated revenue increases from continued investment in its next generation software 
these assumptions  specifically those included within the discounted cash flow estimate  are comprised of the revenue growth rate  gross margin  operating expenses  working capital requirements  and depreciation and amortization expense 
the company has utilized annual revenue growth rates ranging between and 
the high end growth rate reflects the company s projected revenues resulting from the release of the company s next generation software platform  atrio 
this software platform will expand the company s capabilities into new markets 
the company believes these estimates are reasonable given the size of the overall market which it will enter  combined with the projected market share the company expects to achieve 
the projected revenue growth rates ultimately trend to an estimated long term growth rate of 
the company has utilized gross margin estimates materially consistent with historical gross margins achieved 
estimates of operating expenses  working capital requirements and depreciation and amortization expense utilized for this reporting unit are generally consistent with actual historical amounts  adjusted to reflect its continued investment and projected revenue growth from atrio 
the company believes utilization of actual historical results adjusted to reflect its continued investment in atrio is an appropriate basis supporting the fair value of the hotel resort spa reporting unit 
lastly  the company utilized a discount rate of approximately for this reporting unit 
this estimate was derived through a combination of current risk free interest rate data  financial data from companies that par has deemed as its competitors  and was based on volatility between the company s historical financial projections and actual results achieved 
the current economic conditions and the continued volatility in the us and in many other countries in which the company operates could contribute to decreased consumer confidence and continued economic uncertainty which may adversely impact the company s operating performance 
although the company has seen an improvement in the markets which it serves  the continued volatility in these markets could have an impact on purchases of the company s products  which could result in a reduction of sales  operating income and cash flows 
reductions in these results could have a material adverse impact on the underlying estimates used in deriving the fair value of the company s reporting units used in support of its annual goodwill impairment test or could result in a triggering event requiring a fair value remeasurement  particularly if the company is unable to achieve the estimates of revenue growth indicated in the preceding paragraphs 
these conditions may result in an impairment charge in future periods 
the company has reconciled the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the consolidated company  including a reasonable control premium 
taxes the company has significant amounts of deferred tax assets that are reviewed for recoverability and valued accordingly
