overview we are an exploration and production company currently focused on development of unconventional shale oil resources in the bakken shale and three forks formations in the williston basin of north dakota and montana 
as of march   we have acquired approximately  net acres primarily in mckenzie and williams counties of north dakota and roosevelt and sheridan counties of montana 
having identified an area of focus in the bakken shale and three forks formations that we believe will generate attractive returns on invested capital  we are continuing to explore further opportunities in the region 
proved oil and natural gas reserves as of january   totaled  boe 
our fy production averaged boe day and we exited january with approximately boe day of non operated production 
in the core area of north dakota  triangle is directing resources toward its operated program to develop its consolidated positions in mckenzie and williams county  roughly  net acres 
in roosevelt county  montana  the station prospect is a largely contiguous position within the thermally mature area of the williston basin 
the approximate  net acre position is predominantly operated acreage with longer lease term and provides triangle with a scalable development area for the future 
the combination of triangle s value accretive and high growth acreage in north dakota and montana  provides stockholders with a balanced portfolio of pure play exposure to the upside of the williston basin 
with a focus on establishing an efficient development model  the company is pad drilling  which expedites the operated program  while controlling costs and minimizing environmental impacts 
we also intend to use innovative completion  collection  and production techniques which will optimize reservoir drainage while also reducing costs 
additionally  with access to well completion capacity via vertical integration majority owned rockpile energy services  triangle is positioned to lower implied production cost and have greater control over drilling and completions schedule 
plan of operations we own operated and non operated leasehold positions in the williston basin 
we commenced drilling of our first operated well in october as of april   we had nearly finished drilling our fourth operated well 
over a five week period beginning on april   subject to the weather and other external uncontrollable factors  we expect to complete and place on production our first four gross net operated wells 
triangle is currently running a rig drilling program  meaning one rig  the xtreme  is contracted full time and drilling approximately one well per month 
we have temporarily contracted a second rig  pioneer  to drill two to three wells during a three month window  between april and july the focus of our near term drilling program is on our core north dakota acreage in mckenzie and williams county 
rockpile is expected to be available for completions by july triangle will explore the potential to expand the drilling program and number of rigs under management upon the availability of attractive financing 
our non operated leasehold positions are primarily conducted through agreements with major operators in the williston basin  including hess  continental  statoil  newfield  eog  xto  whiting  slawson and kodiak 
these companies are experienced operators in the development of the bakken shale and three forks formations 
as of march   we have participated in the drilling of gross non operated wells  including producing wells and wells in various stages of permitting  drilling or completion 
using industry accepted well spacing parameters and long lateral well bores  we believe that there could be over operated drill spacing units and over well locations for the bakken shale and three forks formations on our acreage in the williston basin 
based on current industry expectations  we believe we can drill six to eight  foot lateral wells on  acre spacing units within our acreage 
consistent with leading field operators  we plan to perform multi stage fracs with to stages on each lateral well 
we also plan to drill shorter laterals on smaller units as dictated by our leasehold position 
separately  we have approximately non operated drill spacing units with greater than working interest in our core area of north dakota and montana 
non core properties we have an working interest in approximately  gross acres approximately  net acres of nova scotia oil and natural gas leases in the windsor sub basin of the maritimes basin 
the leases are to expire in  but can be extended pending agreement of further development plans with the nova scotia regulators 
nova scotia is currently conducting an extensive hydraulic fracturing review to determine whether and how hydraulic fracturing will be allowed in the future 
the review is expected to be completed in calendar year nova scotia also does not currently allow the common industry practice of using salt water disposal wells 
while such government restrictions remain in place  it is uneconomic to proceed in further exploration and development of these leases 
we do not know if and when the restrictions might be lifted  and we do not know if nova scotia would grant an extension to the leases due to nova scotia s existing hydraulic fracturing review 
as of january   we have fully impaired and expensed the million carrying value of our oil and natural gas leases in the maritimes basin 
at january   we have recorded asset retirement obligations of  for our share in costs to clean out frac water ponds  to plug well bores and to restore surface areas in fiscal year relating to our previous exploration and development activities in the maritimes basin 
we may in the future sell our maritimes basin leases  but will likely not do so until meeting our current asset retirement obligations and until we know whether and how hydraulic fracturing will be allowed in the windsor sub basin of the maritimes basin 
results of operations for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of  per common share  basic and diluted for the fiscal year ended january  oil and natural gas operations for fiscal year  we had total oil and natural gas revenues of  compared with  for fiscal year oil and natural gas sales and production costs for each year are summarized in the table that follows 
oil sales revenues increased million to million for fiscal year ended january   as compared to oil sales of million for the fiscal year ended january  in fiscal year  our oil sales averaged boe per day 
our oil sales volume increased to  barrels in fiscal year  as compared to  barrels in fiscal year the volume increase is due to our ongoing bakken exploration and development program 
these increases are primarily due to net wells commencing production in fiscal year for our non operated wells  natural gas is typically flared or used at the wellsite due to i newness of the well  ii lack of local natural gas distribution systems  iii more north dakota natural gas production than the available north dakota natural gas processing facilities can process and iv low prices for natural gas 
most of our natural gas sales in fiscal year were for wet gas sold before processing to extract natural gas liquids from the wet gas 
most of our natural gas sales in fiscal year were for dry gas after extraction of natural gas liquids 
hence the average natural gas sales price was higher in fiscal year than in fiscal year fiscal year ended january  us oil and natural gas operations oil sold barrels   average oil price oil revenue   natural gas sold mcf   average gas price natural gas revenue   natural gas liquids sold gallons  average gas liquids price natural gas liquids revenue  total oil and gas revenues   less production taxes   less lease operating expense   less impairment of oil and natural gas properties  less oil and natural gas amortization expense  less accretion of asset retirement obligations   loss from us oil and natural gas operations  canadian oil and natural gas operations lease operating expense   impairment of oil and natural gas properties  gain on sale of oil and natural gas properties  accretion of asset retirement obligations   loss from canadian oil and natural gas operations  total loss from oil and natural gas operations  other income   foreign exchange gain loss   less depreciation of furniture and equipment   less general and administrative expenses  net loss   total us barrels of oil equivalent boe sold  us oil and natural gas revenue per boe sold us lease operating expense per boe sold us amortization expense per boe sold impairment of oil and natural gas properties during fiscal year and  we recorded impairments of million and million  respectively  in connection with our properties in the maritimes basin of nova scotia 
we assess all unproved property for possible impairment annually or upon a triggering event 
the assessment includes consideration of  among others  intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  governmental restrictions and the assignment of proved reserves 
nova scotia is currently conducting an extensive hydraulic fracturing review to determine whether and how hydraulic fracturing will be allowed in the future 
the review is expected to be completed in calendar year nova scotia also does not currently allow the common industry practice of using salt water disposal wells 
while such government restrictions remain in place  it is uneconomic to proceed in further exploration and development of these leases 
we do not know if and when the restrictions might be lifted  and we do not know if nova scotia would grant an extension to the leases due to nova scotia s existing hydraulic fracturing review 
these conditions are the primary factors that contributed to the full impairment of our nova scotia properties as of january  since we have no proved oil and natural gas reserves in canada  the ceiling test of our canadian oil and natural gas properties results in the expensing of the impairment of our unproved canadian properties during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million ceiling test impairment expense of the capitalized costs of our us oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling reflected the proved reserves at january  estimated by ryder scott 
because all of our production in fiscal year is relatively new  from relatively small working interests in non operated wells many of which do not offset older wells that are similarly completed  it becomes relatively difficult and sometimes impossible to timely obtain from the operators adequate information on the wells to understand variations in well costs  operating costs and production patterns to support as reasonably certain at january  future production that was expected 
despite the thousands of wells that have been drilled in recent years in the bakken formation in north dakota  the proved ie  reasonably certain reserves for a new well or for a proved undeveloped location are largely dependent on the production history of the new well or the well s immediately offsetting the new well or the undeveloped location 
in such an environment of limited well and production information  estimations should be lower as to how much future production from a given well is proved  ie  reasonably certain 
for example  we have a small working interest in a new non operated well that had produced for only three months and the third month production was unusually low for reasons unknown to us 
due to the rapid decline in production  the estimate of the well s proved and reasonably certain reserves was rather low 
after the ryder scott reserve report was completed  the operator made public that the fourth month of production was three times greater than that of the previous month 
the production improvement was indicative that if such information had been available for the estimation of our proved reserves at january   our ceiling impairment would likely have been reduced by million 
a secondary factor contributing to the impairment was poor results from a small area on the southern edge of our acreage position in mckenzie county  north dakota 
we had participated in three wells to test that area  but their disappointing fiscal production history relative to the three wells high capital and operating costs led to the removal in the fall of of proved reserves from eight undeveloped locations that had million in pv value at january  general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes increases in general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years compared with the increases are primarily due to significant increases in the number of employees on september   by january   by june  and by january  as we greatly expanded our acquisition  exploration  development and production activities in north dakota and montana in fiscal year compared with fiscal year increase stock based compensation    salaries  benefits and consulting fees   office costs    professional fees    public company costs    total general and administrative expenses  stock based compensation expense increased approximately million primarily because we had additional employees who received grants of restricted stock units in fiscal year as compared to the same period in fiscal year and because we delayed recognition of certain share based compensation expense until stockholder approval on july  of our omnibus incentive plan  as explained in note of the consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form k 
professional fees increased million primarily for increased legal expenses on various matters including our proxy statement filing  registration statements and due diligence work 
income taxes our fiscal year provision for deferred income taxes is zero due to recognition of valuation allowances against our net deferred tax assets of million and million at january  and  respectively 
if facts and circumstances indicate that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset is more likely than not to be realized in the future  then the valuation allowance would be correspondingly reduced and a deferred tax benefit recognized 
liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
we currently anticipate capital requirements for fiscal year to be approximately million to million 
these funds will be allocated primarily towards our operated drilling program to million 
in the absence of additional financing  we will allocate million to million toward additional acreage acquisitions 
we expect to be able to fund these expenditures  as well as other commitments and working capital requirements  using existing capital  additional capital raised through the sale of debt or equity securities  our new reserve based lending facility  or through participation in joint ventures and or asset sales 
we may expand or reduce our capital expenditures depending on  among other things  the results of future wells and our available capital 
as of january   we had cash of million consisting primarily of cash held in bank accounts with wells fargo  royal bank of canada and jp morgan chase  as compared to million at january  working capital was million as of january   as compared to million at january  our ability to continue to acquire property  accelerate our drilling program  and grow our oil and natural gas reserves and cash flow would be impacted if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital on april   our subsidiary triangle usa petroleum corporation entered into a senior secured credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent and as issuing lender 
the million credit agreement has an initial borrowing base of million  subject to quarterly redeterminations in and semi annual redeterminations thereafter 
as of april   there were no revolving borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement 
all borrowings under the new revolving credit facility mature on april  we may prepay borrowings under the new revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage costs 
the revolving credit facility is secured by certain of tusa s assets and the obligations are guaranteed by triangle petroleum corporation 
the credit agreement contains representations  warranties and covenants that are customary for similar credit arrangements 
net cash used by operating activities cash flow used by operating activities was million and million for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
the million increase in cash used in fiscal year compared with fiscal year is due primarily to an approximate million increase in general and administrative expenses  an approximate million increase in lease operating expenses and approximately million in costs paid for drilling our operated wells which is recorded as an account receivable from various working interest partners 
we also had an increase in cash flow from operating activities of approximately million due to increased revenues from oil and natural gas operations 
net cash used by investing activities in fiscal year  investing activities used million in cash as compared to million used in fiscal year cash used in investing activities increased due to the following i approximately million for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  ii approximately million to purchase additional property and equipment  iii approximately million of prepaid drilling and completion costs paid to operators and iv approximately million for deposits paid for hydraulic fracturing equipment under construction for our owned subsidiary  rockpile 
the cash used in investing activities in fiscal year was offset by million of proceeds received in connection with the sale of the non controlling interest in rockpile 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flow provided by financing activities was million compared to million provided in fiscal year the million increase is primarily a result of the sale of  shares of our common stock for per share in march issuance costs in connection with the sale of these securities were approximately million 
during fiscal year  we also received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options 
cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal year was a result of the sale of equity securities during the year 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share  providing net proceeds of approximately million in cash after offering and issuance costs 
in march  we sold  shares at a price of for net proceeds of approximately million 
in august  we sold  shares at a price of for net proceeds of approximately  during fiscal year  we also received proceeds of  for the exercise of stock options 
contractual obligations as of january  the company leases office facilities in denver  colorado and calgary  alberta  canada under operating lease agreements that expire in september and july the company also leases office equipment under an operating lease that expires in the following table shows the annual rentals per year for the life of the leases fiscal year ending january  annual rental amount as of january  the company was subject to commitments on a drilling rig contract 
the contract expires in september in the event of early termination of the contract  the company would be obligated to pay an aggregate amount of approximately million as of january  as required under the terms of the contract 
subsequent to year end  the company assumed an additional drilling rig contract commencing on april  for a term of days 
in the event of early termination under this contract  the company would be obligated to pay an additional million

critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results  future results of operations will be affected 
full cost accounting method we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
under the full cost method of accounting  no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposition of oil and natural gas properties unless such disposition would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
companies that follow the full cost accounting method are required to make quarterly ceiling test calculations on country wide cost pools 
this test limits total capitalized costs for oil and natural gas properties net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a and deferred income taxes to the sum of the present value discounted at per annum of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized  and all related tax effects 
revenue calculations in the reserves are based on the unweighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or commodity prices will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
any recorded impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
amortization of proved oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method  whereby capitalized costs  including future development costs and asset retirement obligations  are amortized over total estimated proved reserves 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties  including those in connection with wells in progress  are excluded from the costs being amortized 
we do not have major development projects that are excluded from costs being amortized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate excluded costs for inclusion in the costs to be amortized resulting from the determination of proved reserves or impairments 
to the extent that the evaluation indicates these properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to production expense in the period incurred 
asset retirement obligations we recognize the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
oil and natural gas producing companies incur this liability in connection with costs related to the plugging of wells  the removal of facilities and equipment and site restorations upon acquiring or drilling a successful well 
subsequent to initial measurement  the asset retirement liability is required to be accreted each period 
capitalized costs are depleted as a component of the full cost pool 
estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and natural gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
we use the units of production method to amortize the cost of our oil and natural gas properties 
changes in our estimate of reserve quantities and commodity prices will cause corresponding changes in amortization expense in periods subsequent to these changes  or in some cases  a full cost ceiling limitation charge in the period of the revision 
income taxes income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes 
we compute deferred income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred income taxes are provided on all temporary differences between the financial basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not will be realized 
we assess quarterly the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as historical performance and future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation related to all stock based awards  including restricted stock units and stock options  in the consolidated financial statements based on their estimated grant date fair value 
we grant various types of stock based awards including stock options and restricted stock units 
the fair value of stock option awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
service based restricted stock and units are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
compensation cost is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
see note for additional information regarding our stock based compensation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements refer to note of the consolidated financial statements
