item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with two business elements angioedema franchise the principal focus of our efforts is to identify  develop and commercialize treatments for conditions identified as plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedema  including hereditary angioedema hae  ace inhibitor induced angioedema acei ae and angioedema of unknown origin  or idiopathic angioedema 
we developed kalbitor ecallantide on our own and since february we have been selling it in the united states for the treatment of acute attacks of hae 
outside of the united states  we have established partnerships to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize kalbitor in certain markets and are evaluating opportunities in others 
we are expanding our franchise for the treatment of angioedemas in the following ways advancing the clinical development of ecallantide for use in the treatment of acei ae 
developing a laboratory test that could assist in the differentiation between histamine mediated and plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedema 
continuing our development of a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein pkal which would be a candidate to prophylactically treat plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedemas 
phage display licensing and funded research program we leverage our proprietary phage display technology through our licensing and funded research program  referred to as the lfrp 
this program has provided us a portfolio of product candidates being developed by our licensees  which currently includes product candidates in clinical development  including four products in phase trials 
our lfrp generated revenue of approximately million in  and to the extent that our licensees commercialize some of the phase product candidates according to published timelines  revenues under the lfrp are expected to experience significant growth over the next several years 
angioedema franchise we are focused on identifying and developing treatments for patients who experience plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedema 
using our phage display technology  we developed ecallantide  a compound shown in vitro to be a high affinity  high specificity inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein 
plasma kallikrein  an enzyme found in blood  produces bradykinin  a protein that causes blood vessels to enlarge or dilate  which can cause swelling known as angioedema 
plasma kallikrein is believed to be a key component in the regulation of inflammation and contact activation pathways 
excess plasma kallikrein activity is thought to play a role in a number of inflammatory diseases  including hae  acei ae and idiopathic angioedema  all of which are plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedemas 
we have four key areas of activity in our angioedema franchise hae and kalbitor 
in february  we began selling kalbitor in the united states for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
we are selling kalbitor on our own in the united states 
working with international partners  we intend to seek approval for and commercialize kalbitor for hae and other angioedema indications in markets outside of the united states 
we have entered into agreements for others to develop and commercialize subcutaneous ecallantide for the treatment of hae and other therapeutic indications throughout europe  japan  australia  new zealand and other countries in north africa  the middle east  latin america excluding mexico and the caribbean 
clinical trials for acei ae 
there are two ongoing clinical studies exploring the use of ecallantide for the treatment of acei ae  a life threatening inflammatory response brought on by adverse reactions to angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors 
in august  we commenced patient treatments in a dose ranging phase clinical study 
there is also an investigator sponsored trial being conducted at the university of cincinnati  college of medicine 
new test for plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedemas 
as part of extending the angioedema franchise  we are developing a laboratory test that would measure perturbations in the kallikrein kinin pathway  thereby assisting in differentiating plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedemas from histamine mediated angioedema 
we anticipate that this laboratory test will provide the ability to identify plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedema including type iii hae and angioedema of unknown origin  or idiopathic angioedema 
new antibody for plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedemas 
leveraging our knowledge of angioedema and the kallikrein kinin pathway  we are investigating the use of a fully human monoclonal antibody that is an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein and which would be a candidate to prophylactically treat plasma kallikrein bradykinin mediated angioedemas 
after completing a series of pharmacokinetic  tolerability and preclinical studies  we believe our pkal antibody may be effective for prophylactically treating these indications 
we expect to file an ind for this antibody in mid licensing and funded research program lfrp product development we believe that our phage display libraries  which we have developed using our core technology and know how  represent a leading technology in antibody discovery 
we leverage our proprietary phage display technology and libraries through our lfrp licenses and collaborations 
to date  we have received more than million under the lfrp  primarily related to license fees and milestones  including approximately million of revenue in the lfrp has the potential for substantially greater revenues if and when product candidates that are discovered by our licensees receive marketing approval and are commercialized 
there are approximately ongoing lfrp license agreements 
currently  product candidates generated by our licensees or collaborators under the lfrp portfolio are in clinical development  four of which are in phase trials  four are in phase and ten are in phase in addition  one product has received market approval from the fda 
furthermore  we estimate that our licensees and collaborators have over additional product candidates in various stages of research and preclinical development 
our licensees and collaborators are responsible for all costs associated with development of these product candidates 
generally  we receive milestones and or royalties from our licensees and collaborators to the extent these product candidates advance in development and are ultimately commercialized 
we expect to receive royalties from commercial sales beginning in under loan arrangements with affiliates of cowen healthcare royalty partners cowen healthcare  we have obtained a debt financing commitment of up to million  secured exclusively by the lfrp  which is described more fully in note to notes to consolidated financial statements filed under item of this form k 
to the extent that product candidates in the lfrp portfolio receive marketing approval and are commercialized according to published timelines  we expect to receive royalties from commercial sales beginning in results of operations revenues 
total revenues for were million  compared with million in and million in our financial guidance for total revenue in is to million  including kalbitor sales of to million 
product sales 
we began commercializing kalbitor in the united states in for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
we sell kalbitor to our distributors  and we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed to the distributor  typically upon delivery 
due to the specialty nature of kalbitor  the limited number of patients  limited return rights and contractual limits on inventory levels  we anticipate that distributors will carry limited inventory 
we record product sales net of allowances and accruals related to trade prompt pay discounts  government rebates  a patient financial assistance program  product returns and other applicable allowances 
in  product sales of kalbitor increased to million  net of product discounts and allowances of million  compared with product sales of million  net of product discounts and allowances of  during the increase in product sales was primarily due to a significant increase in the volume of kalbitor units sold in as compared to development and license fees 
we also derive revenues from licensing  funded research and development fees  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators  in amounts that fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of the licensing and clinical activities of our collaborators and licensees 
this revenue was million in  million in and million in development and license fee revenue in included million recognized under our agreement  as amended  with sigma tau  compared with recognized in see note  significant transactions sigma tau 
development and license fee revenue in included the recognition of million from the sale of rights to royalties and other payments related to xyntha  a product developed by one of our licensees under the lfrp  and million of previously deferred revenue associated with the cubist license that was fully recognized during based upon cubist s termination of its ecallantide development program 
during  we recognized million of revenue associated with the cubist license 
cost of product sales 
we incurred million of costs associated with product sales during and  during this primarily includes the cost of testing  filling  packaging and distributing the kalbitor product  as well as a royalty due on net sales of kalbitor 
costs associated with the manufacture of kalbitor prior to fda approval were previously expensed when incurred and accordingly are not included in the cost of product sales during or the supply of kalbitor produced prior to fda approval is expected to meet anticipated commercial needs through when this supply has been depleted  we expect our cost of product sales will increase  reflecting the full manufacturing cost of kalbitor 
research and development 
our research and development expenses are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands kalbitor development costs other research and development expenses lfrp pass through fees ecallantide drug substance manufacturing costs total our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs for our personnel dedicated to research  development  medical and pharmacovigilence activities  costs of post approval studies and commitments and kalbitor life cycle management  as well as fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside parties to conduct research and clinical trials 
kalbitor development costs increased in primarily due to clinical trial costs associated with our development efforts using ecallantide for the treatment of acei ae  including the phase clinical study that was initiated during costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval for the treatment of hae in territories outside the united states were million and million during and  respectively 
these amounts were reimbursed by sigma tau and such payments are recorded as development and license fee revenue in our results of operations 
the decrease in other research and development costs from was due to a shift in internal efforts from early stage development programs to kalbitor development 
the decrease in other research and development expenses in is primarily due to million of reduced personnel expenses resulting from our workforce reduction 
research and development expenses may increase in future years  due to clinical trial costs associated with our phase clinical study exploring the use of ecallantide for the treatment of acei ae and costs associated with developing the plasma kallikrein antibody as a therapeutic candidate 
until the phase clinical study is completed  we are not able to predict the future clinical costs that may be incurred for this indication 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the sales and marketing costs of commercializing kalbitor  costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees and the reporting requirements of a public company 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in costs is primarily due to the expansion of infrastructure to support kalbitor commercial efforts  primarily sales and marketing programs  and additional legal expenses to protect our intellectual property 
the increase in costs is primarily due to additional infrastructure to support the commercial launch of kalbitor  including the expansion of sales and marketing personnel 
we do not anticipate a significant change in selling  general and administrative expenses in restructuring and impairment 
in  we implemented a workforce reduction to focus necessary resources on the commercialization of kalbitor 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
due to the decrease in necessary facility space following the workforce reduction  we amended our facility lease  resulting in a charge of approximately  for the write down of leasehold improvements 
interest expense 
interest expense in was million compared to million in and million in the higher expense was primarily due to additional interest expense under the cowen healthcare loan of approximately million for payments due in connection with the sale of our rights to royalties and other payments related to the xyntha product 
interest and other income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease from was primarily due to lower cash balances during the decrease from was due to lower rates of return on our short term cash investments 
in  income of million was recognized from several grants received under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
under this program  the internal revenue service  in conjunction with the department of health and human services  approved our applications for projects that showed significant potential to produce new and cost saving therapies  support jobs and increase us competitiveness 
all proceeds from this grant were classified as other income in the statement of operations 
in  we received an  grant from the walloon region of belgium  which included specific criteria regarding employment and investment levels that needed to be met 
in connection with the closure of our liege  belgium facility in  we refunded approximately  of the grant 
in  all remaining investment criteria were met and the residual grant balance of approximately million was released from short term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized as other income in the statement of operations 
net loss 
for the year ended december   the net loss was million or per share  as compared to million or per share in  and million or per share in liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash flow activity years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities effect of foreign currency translation on cash balances net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we require cash to fund our operating activities  make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and service debt 
through december   we have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million  and from borrowed funds under our loan agreement with cowen healthcare  which are secured by certain assets associated with our lfrp 
in addition  we generate funds from product sales and development and license fees 
our excess funds are currently invested in short term investments primarily consisting of united states treasury notes and bills and money market funds backed by the united states treasury 
our financial guidance is that we expect to be at cash flow breakeven during operating activities 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our million net loss 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had cash outflows due to changes in other operating assets and liabilities  including an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to our collaborations to commercialize ecallantide outside of the united states 
in july  we entered into a lease agreement for new premises located in burlington  massachusetts 
the aggregate minimum lease commitment over the ten year term of the new lease is approximately million 
the landlord has provided us with a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million 
as of december   we have received  of reimbursements from the landlord under the tentant improvement allowance 
the remainder is expected to be received in the in the first half of the full tenant improvement allowance will be amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease as an offset to rent expense 
in january  we relocated our facility and terminated our prior facility lease 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our million net loss 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had a net change in other operating assets and liabilities of million  including a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
the change in deferred revenue is primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue associated with the termination of the license and collaboration agreement with cubist  offset by additional deferred revenue of million from new collaborations to commercialize ecallantide outside the united states 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our million net loss 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million  interest expense of million  non cash income of million primarily due to the recognition of million in income related to the walloon grant  impairment of fixed assets totaling million  and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had a net change in other operating assets and liabilities which used cash of  including decreases in deferred revenue of million and accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and deferred rent of  these were offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
investing activities 
our investing activities for consisted of investment maturities totaling approximately million  offset by the purchase of investments of million 
in addition  during  we expended approximately million in leasehold improvements related to the build out of the new burlington facility  of which  was reimbursed by the landlord in the residual balance will be reimbursed by the landlord during as referenced in the operating activities section above 
net of the tenant improvement allowance  we incurred approximately million for tenant improvements in and we expect to incur an additional  of tenant improvements during the first quarter of in conjunction with the burlington lease agreement  we have provided the landlord a letter of credit of million to secure our obligations under the lease 
in july  we entered into a lease agreement for new premises located in burlington  massachusetts 
the aggregate minimum lease commitment over the ten year term of the new lease is approximately million 
the landlord has provided us with a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million 
our investing activities for consisted of the purchase of securities totaling approximately million  offset by investment maturities of million  as well as a decrease of  in restricted cash from the contractual reduction of the letter of credit that serves as our security deposit for the lease of our facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
our investing activities for consisted of investment maturities totaling approximately million  offset by purchases of additional securities of million and the purchase of approximately  of fixed assets 
financing activities 
our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million of new debt from an affiliate of cowen healthcare  as well as principal repayments of long term debt totaling million  consisting of capital lease payments and million to an affiliate of cowen healthcare 
our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock  as well as principal repayments of long term debt totaling million  consisting of capital lease payments and million to cowen healthcare 
our financing activities for consisted of equity offerings providing net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of million from the tranche b loan with an affiliate of cowen healthcare  which was an amendment to our existing loan agreement with cowen healthcare 
this tranche b loan is secured by our lfrp on the same terms as the initial tranche a loan  which was executed in we also repaid long term obligations  totaling million  primarily principal payments to cowen healthcare on these loans 
we expect to continue to manage our cash requirements by completing additional partnerships  collaborations  and financial and strategic transactions 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments together with anticipated cash flow from existing development  collaborations and license agreements and product sales of kalbitor will be sufficient to support our current operations through we will need additional funds if our cash requirements exceed our current expectations or if we generate less revenue than we expect during this period 
we may seek additional funding through our collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all  and we may not be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
if we need additional funds and are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we would curtail significantly our research  development or commercialization programs in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations  which could adversely affect our business prospects 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years years more than years in thousands note payable leasehold improvement arrangements operating lease obligations patent and product license obligations obligations for research  development and manufacturing total contractual obligations these amounts represent projected future principal and interest payments to cowen healthcare based on our current lfrp projections  which are subject to uncertainties based on the timing and amounts of cash receipts under the lfrp
