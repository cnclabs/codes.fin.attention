legislative and regulatory changes and matters various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering a number of issues that could shape the future of the electric utility industry 
such issues include  among others the ability of electric utilities to recover stranded costs  the role of electric utilities  independent power producers and competitive bidding in the purchase  construction and operation of new generating capacity  the pricing of transmission service on an electric utility s transmission system  ferc s assessment of market power and utilities ability to buy generation assets  mandatory transmission reliability standards  the authority of ferc to grant utilities the power of eminent domain  increasing requirements for renewable energy sources  demand response and energy efficiency standards  comprehensive multi emissions environmental regulation in the areas of air  water  and waste  regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  ferc s increased ability to impose financial penalties  the american recovery and reinvestment act of  the dodd frank act  and the sec s requirement of financial statements prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as issued by the international accounting standards board by us issuers for purposes of their filings with the sec

environmental matters environmental quality cleco is subject to federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment 
violations of these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines and penalties 
cleco has obtained the environmental permits necessary for its operations  and management believes cleco is in compliance in all material respects with these permits  as well as all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
environmental requirements affecting electric power generation facilities are complex  change frequently  and have become more stringent over time as a result of new legislation  administrative actions  and judicial interpretations 
therefore  the capital costs and other expenditures necessary to comply with existing and new environmental requirements are difficult to determine 
cleco power may request recovery  from its retail customers  of the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
if revenue relief were to be approved by the lpsc  then cleco power s retail rates could increase 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  then cleco power would bear those costs directly 
such a decision could negatively impact  perhaps significantly  the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco s capital expenditures related to environmental compliance were million during cleco corporation cleco power form k and are estimated to be million in the following table lists capital expenditures for environmental matters by subsidiary 
all amounts include afudc 
subsidiary thousands environmental capital expenditures for projected environmental capital expenditures for cleco power evangeline total projected environmental capital expenditures for include million related to compliance with mats  million related to compliance with csapr  and million related to the expansion of the ash disposal landfill for madison unit air quality air emissions from each of cleco s generating units are strictly regulated by the epa and the ldeq 
the ldeq has authority over and implements certain air quality programs established by the epa under the federal caa  as well as its own air quality regulations 
the ldeq establishes standards of performance and requires permits for electric generating units in louisiana 
all of cleco s generating units are subject to these requirements 
the epa has proposed and adopted rules under the authority of the caa relevant to the emissions of so and no 
x 
from cleco s generating units 
the caa established the acid rain program to address the effects of acid rain and imposed restrictions on so emissions from certain generating units 
the caa requires these generating units to possess a regulatory allowance for each ton of so emitted beginning in the year the epa allocates a set number of allowances to each affected unit based on its historic emissions 
as of december   cleco power and midstream had sufficient allowances for operations and expect to have sufficient allowances for operations under the acid rain program 
the acid rain program also established emission rate limits on nox emissions for certain generating units 
cleco power is able to achieve compliance with the acid rain permit limits for nox at all of its affected facilities 
on july   the epa finalized a rule titled federal implementation plans to reduce interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone known as csapr that would require significant reductions in so and so emissions from electric generating units egus in states  including louisiana 
under csapr  the epa would set total emissions limits for each state allowing limited interstate trading and unlimited intrastate trading of emission allowances among power plants to comply with these limits beginning may  specifically for louisiana  csapr would limit nox 

emissions for the ozone season  consisting of the months of may through september 
on december   in response to numerous petitions by both state and industry participants  the dc circuit court of appeals issued an order staying implementation of csapr pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule 
the court further ordered that the clean air interstate rule  a predecessor rule to csapr  remain in place while csapr is stayed 
oral arguments are scheduled to be heard in april and the court could decide the case as early as the summer of cleco is considering various options for meeting the no 
x 
allocation established by csapr for cleco s generating units  in the event the stay is eventually lifted 
these options include the installation of additional emission controls  the purchase of allowances  the implementation of alternate dispatch schedules for generation units  and the acquisition of alternate generation resources 
for more information  see the chart above detailing cleco power s anticipated capital expenditures and part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition regulatory and other matters generation rfp for a discussion of cleco power s rfp for contractual resources to meet csapr requirements 
if the stay is lifted and cleco cannot obtain sufficient ozone season allowances to cover its ozone season emissions then despite the implementation of one or more of the above options  cleco may not be able to meet its customers demand without incurring significant fines and penalties 
the epa also has adopted rules under section of the caa governing the emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from certain egus 
the epa established maximum achievable control technology mact standards for coal fired egus in late  and signed a final rule setting forth national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap from coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units on december  the final rule is now known as mats 
mats requires affected egus to meet specific numeric emission standards and work practice standards to address hazardous air pollutants 
mats imposes strict emission limits on new and existing coal and liquid oil fired egus for mercury  acid gases hydrochloric acid  or hci  as a surrogate  and non mercury metallic pollutants filterable particulate matter filterable pm as a surrogate 
affected egus also have to comply with certain work practice standards to control the emission of organic air toxins 
mats allows existing sources approximately three years to comply with the rule 
the actual compliance deadline is april  a one year compliance extension is available with approval from the relevant permitting authority  which in cleco s case is the ldeq  if that facility is actively installing control equipment to comply with the rule 
cleco continues its evaluation of control technology options for dolet hills  madison unit  and rodemacher unit significant capital expenditures could be required beginning in to engineer  procure  and install pollution controls and emissions monitoring equipment to ensure cleco will be in a position to comply with mats in a timely manner 
cleco s liquid oil fired units should not be affected by the rule 
for more information  see the chart above and the language that follows for a discussion of cleco power s anticipated control installations and associated capital expenditures required to comply with mats 
greenhouse gases ghg and their role in climate change have been the focus of recent study and legal action  including proposed federal legislation  final and proposed federal rulemakings  and civil actions 
fossil fuel fired egus emit a significant amount of ghg in the combustion process 
congress has attempted to craft specific legislation that would reduce emissions of ghg by utilities  industrial facilities  and other manufacturing sectors of the economy 
while congressional attempts have not been successful  the possibility exists that federal ghg legislation may be enacted within the next several years 
in the absence of federal legislation  the epa has recently adopted a series of rules under the caa that  taken together  cleco corporation cleco power form k regulate ghg emissions from both mobile and stationary sources 
as a result  beginning july   new major stationary sources of ghg emissions and major modifications of existing stationary sources are required to obtain a permit for their ghg emissions 
in its may   prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v ghg tailoring rule  the epa set the threshold for new major sources and major modifications of existing sources of ghg emissions at  tons per year and  tons per year of co 

equivalents  respectively 
at this time  cleco does not anticipate a modification at any of its existing sources that would trigger psd and an associated best available control technology bact demonstration for ghg 
in addition to its program for applying psd and title v permitting requirements to the largest stationary sources of ghg  the epa has also committed to establish new source performance standards nsps for ghg emissions from fossil fuel power plants and refineries 
on december   the epa announced that it had settled litigation with states and environmental groups that sought to compel the epa to establish nsps 
the epa and the petitioners in the case are in the process of negotiating a revised schedule for the nsps rulemaking 
under the settlement  the epa committed to issue standards for new and modified facilities  and the power plant settlement also commits the epa to issue standards for existing facilities 
cleco expects that the epa will issue guidelines to the states requiring them to adopt and submit to the epa for approval standards for existing  unmodified facilities that conform to those guidelines 
once the state standards are approved by the epa and become effective  existing unmodified facilities must be given a reasonable amount of time to comply with the standards 
at this time  cleco cannot predict what these standards will entail or what level of ghg controls the epa and the state of louisiana will require 
however  any new rules that require significant reductions of ghg emissions from egus could require potentially significant expenditures by cleco  or modification or curtailment of operations  to maintain or achieve compliance 
the enactment of federal or state renewable portfolio standards rps mandating the use of renewable and alternative fuel sources  such as wind  solar  biomass  and geothermal  could result in certain changes in cleco s business or its competitive position 
these changes could include additional costs for renewable energy credits  alternate compliance payments  or capital expenditures for renewable generation resources 
rps legislation has been enacted in many states and congress is considering various bills that would create a national rps 
cleco continues to evaluate the impacts of potential rps legislation on its businesses based on the rps programs in other states 
cleco will continue to monitor developments related to rps at the federal and state levels

as part of its periodic re evaluation of the protectiveness of the national ambient air quality standards naaqs  the epa has adopted rules that strengthen the naaqs for specific criteria pollutants including ozone  no  and no in  the epa issued a naaqs for ozone of parts per billion ppb 
the epa subsequently proposed to lower that standard  but dropped its proposed reconsideration and is currently moving ahead with states  including louisiana  to implement the ppb ozone under the naaqs 
the epa has recommended the five parish area around baton rouge as a non attainment area for ozone under the naaqs  which will require louisiana to establish a state implementation plan to bring those areas back into attainment by since nox emissions are a precursor to ozone formation  existing fossil fuel fired egus located in or near ozone non attainment areas could be targeted for installation of additional nox emission controls 
cleco cannot determine the potential impact of this rule on its generating units until louisiana finalizes its state implementation plan for this rule 
a revised primary naaqs for no promulgated by the epa took effect on april  the epa established a new one hour standard at a level of ppb to supplement the existing annual standard 
the ldeq has recommended designating two portions of highway in the baton rouge and new orleans areas as non attainment for no  however  the epa may redesignate areas based on new data it receives from states 
due to the fact that fossil fuel fired egus are a significant source of no emissions in the country  a non attainment designation could result in utilities such as cleco being required to substantially reduce their no emissions 
however  because no state implementation plan has been proposed  cleco cannot predict the potential impacts of such a rule on its generating units at this time 
the epa revised the naaqs for so 

on june  the new standard is now a one hour health standard of ppb  designed to reduce short term exposures to so ranging from five minutes to hours 
an important aspect of the new so standard is a revised emission monitoring network combined with a new ambient air modeling approach to determine compliance with the new standard 
the ldeq has recommended st 
bernard and east baton rouge as non attainment areas 
the epa expects to identify or designate areas not meeting the new standard by july utilities could be required to substantially reduce their so emissions to comply with this naaqs 
however  because no state implementation plan has been proposed  cleco is unable to determine the potential impacts of this rule on its generating units at this time 
in february  cleco power received notices from the epa requesting information relating to the brame energy center and the dolet hills power station 
the apparent purpose of the data request is to determine whether cleco power has complied with new source review and nsps requirements under the caa in connection with capital expenditures  modifications  or operational changes made at these facilities 
cleco power has completed its response to the initial data request 
it is unknown at this time whether the epa will take further action as a result of the information provided by cleco power 
water quality cleco s facilities are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations regarding wastewater discharges 
cleco has received from the epa and the ldeq permits required under the federal clean water act cwa for wastewater discharges from its generating stations 
wastewater discharge permits have fixed dates of expiration  and cleco applies for renewal of these permits within the applicable time periods 
on march   the epa proposed regulations which would establish standards for cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and other facilities pursuant to section b of the cwa 
the standards are intended to protect fish cleco corporation cleco power form k and other aquatic wildlife by minimizing capture both in screens attached to intake structures impingement mortality  and in the actual intake structures themselves entrainment mortality 
for existing facilities that are designed to draw at least two million gallons per day of water from waters of the united states and use at least of the water they withdraw exclusively for cooling  the proposed standards would set a performance standard  measured as a fish mortality rate due to impingement  or reduce the flow velocity at cooling water intakes to less than feet per second  and require entrainment standards to be determined on a case by case basis by state delegated permitting authorities 
facilities subject to the proposed standards would have a maximum of eight years to comply with the impingement requirements  although state permitting authorities would have discretion to set a shorter deadline 
compliance with entrainment standards would be required as soon as possible  by a date to be determined by the same permitting authorities 
as presently drafted  portions of the proposed rule could apply to all of cleco s fossil fuel steam electric generating stations 
until more thorough studies are conducted  including technical and economic evaluations of the control options available and a final rule is issued  cleco remains uncertain which technology options or retrofits would be required to be installed on its affected facilities 
however  the costs of required technology options and retrofits could be significant  especially if closed cycle cooling is required 
the cwa requires the epa to periodically review and  if appropriate  revise technology based effluent limitations guidelines for categories of industrial facilities  including power generating facilities 
the epa is currently expected to issue proposed revised steam electric effluent limitations guidelines by july  and final revised steam electric effluent limitations guidelines by january the revised effluent limitations guidelines could require costly technological upgrades at cleco s existing facilities  in particular if additional wastewater treatment systems are required to be installed 
since the revised regulations are yet to be proposed  cleco is unable to predict what the new effluent limitations guidelines will be or how significant the costs may be for cleco to comply 
solid waste disposal in the course of operations  cleco s facilities generate solid and hazardous waste materials requiring management or eventual disposal 
with the exception of coal combustion by products or residuals ccrs  cleco does not dispose of wastes generated by its facilities on site 
the solid waste division of the ldeq has adopted a permitting system for the management and disposal of solid waste generated by power stations 
cleco has received all required permits from the ldeq for the on site disposal of solid waste from its generating stations 
cleco has renewed the solid waste permits for the existing brame energy center and dolet hills solid waste units and has upgraded them according to the current solid waste regulations and permit requirements 
on may   the epa released a proposed rule for regulating the disposal and management of ccrs from coal fired power plants 
rather than offering a single approach  the epa requested comments on two options for regulating ccrs 
the first  known as the subtitle c option  would regulate ccrs as a new special waste subject to many of the requirements for hazardous waste  while the second  known as the subtitle d option  would regulate ccrs in a manner similar to industrial solid waste 
either of the epa proposed options represents a shift toward more comprehensive and costly requirements for ccr disposal and management  but the subtitle c option contains significantly more stringent requirements and will require greater capital and operating costs to comply with that rule  if finalized 
both options seem to allow the continued use of ash for certain beneficial reuses 
depending upon the outcome of the final rule  this regulatory proposal could significantly impact the manner and cost in which cleco power manages its ccrs 
the final ccr rule is now expected to be issued by the epa in late or early any stricter requirements imposed on coal ash and associated ash management units by the epa as a result of this new rule could significantly increase the cost of operating existing units or require them to be significantly upgraded 
until a final rule is promulgated  cleco is unable to determine how significant the costs associated with potentially stricter requirements is likely to be 
cleco produces certain wastes that are classified as hazardous at its electric generating stations and at other locations 
cleco does not treat  store long term  or dispose of these wastes on site  therefore  no permits are required 
all hazardous wastes produced by cleco are properly disposed of at permitted hazardous waste disposal sites 
toxic substances control act tsca the tsca directs the epa to regulate the marketing  disposal  manufacturing  processing  distribution in commerce  and use of pcbs 
cleco may continue to operate equipment containing pcbs under the tsca 
once the equipment reaches the end of its usefulness  the epa regulates handling and disposal of the equipment and fluids containing pcbs 
within these regulations  the handling and disposal is allowed only through the epa approved and permitted facilities 
cleco properly disposes its pcb waste material at tsca permitted disposal facilities 
toxics release inventory tri the tri requires an annual report from industrial facilities on about substances that the facilities release into air  water  and land 
the tri ranks companies based on how much of a particular substance they release on a state and parish county level 
annual reports are due to the epa on july following the reporting year end 
cleco has submitted required tri reports on its activities  and the tri rankings are available to the public 
the rankings do not result in any federal or state penalties 
electric and magnetic fields emfs the possibility that exposure to emfs emanating from electric power lines  household appliances  and other electric devices may result in adverse health effects or damage to the environment has been a subject of some public attention 
cleco power funds scientific research on emfs through various organizations 
to date  there are no definitive results  but research is continuing 
lawsuits alleging that the presence of electric power transmission and distribution lines has an adverse effect on health and or property values have arisen in several states 
cleco power is not a party in any lawsuits related to emfs 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla in october  cleco received a special notice for remedial investigation and feasibility study ri fs from the epa pursuant to cercla also known as the superfund statute 
cercla establishes several classes of prps for a cleco corporation cleco power form k contaminated site  and imposes strict  joint and several liability on those prps for the cost of response to the contamination 
the special notice requested that cleco corporation and cleco power  along with many other listed prps  enter into negotiations with the epa for the performance of an ri fs at an area known as the devil s swamp lake site just northwest of baton rouge  louisiana 
the epa has identified cleco as one of many companies sending pcb wastes for disposal to the site 
the devil s swamp lake site has been proposed to be added to the national priorities list npl based on the release of pcbs to fisheries and wetlands located on the site 
the epa has yet to make a final determination on whether to add devil s swamp lake site to the npl 
the prps began discussing a potential proposal to the epa in february negotiations among the prps and the epa are ongoing in regard to the ri fs at the devil s swamp lake site  with little progress having been made since february the prps alleged to have disposed pcbs at the site have proposed a tentative cost sharing formula with the facility owner to fund the ri fs 
the response to the proposal has been pending for months 
management is unable to determine how significant cleco s share of the costs associated with the ri fs and possible response action at the facility site may be 
cleco corporation cleco power form k item a 
risk factors the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the registrants 
transmission constraints transmission constraints could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power relies on two main suppliers of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
at times  even after completion of the acadiana load pocket project  physical constraints limit the amount of purchased power these transmission providers can deliver into cleco power s service territory  which in turn can affect capacity or power purchases under long term contracts  as well as spot market power purchases 
if the amount of purchased power actually delivered into cleco s transmission system were to be less than the amount of power contracted for delivery  cleco power may rely on its own generation facilities to meet customer demand 
cleco power s incremental generation cost at that time could be higher than the cost to purchase power from the wholesale power market  thereby increasing its customers ultimate cost 
in addition  the lpsc may not allow cleco power to recover part or all of its incremental generation cost  which could be substantial 
lpsc audits the lpsc conducts fuel audits that could result in cleco power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue 
generally  fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the lpsc established fuel adjustment clause  which enables cleco power to pass on to its customers substantially all such expenses 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to a periodic fuel audit by the lpsc 
the lpsc fuel adjustment clause general order issued november   in docket no 
u provides that an audit will be performed not less than every other year 
cleco power currently has fuel adjustment clause filings for through subject to audit 
in march  the lpsc proceeded with the audit of fuel adjustment clause filings for the years through the total amount of fuel expenses included in the audit is approximately billion 
cleco power has responded to several data requests from the lpsc 
these responses are currently under review by the lpsc 
the lpsc has not stated an amount of the fuel costs  if any  that would be disallowed and result in a refund to the customers 
management is not able to predict or give a reasonable estimate of the possible range of the disallowance  if any  related to this audit 
however  if a disallowance of fuel costs is ordered resulting in a refund  any such refund could have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the most recent fuel audit completed by the lpsc covered and and resulted in a refund of million to cleco power s retail customers in the first quarter of the lpsc conducts environmental audits that could result in cleco power making substantial refunds of previously recorded revenue 
in july  the lpsc issued docket no 
u subdocket a  which provides for an eac to recover certain costs of environmental compliance as an adder to customers bills 
the costs eligible for recovery are prudently incurred air emissions credits associated with complying with federal  state  and local air emission regulations that apply to the generation of electricity reduced by the sale of such allowances 
also eligible for recovery are variable emission mitigation costs  which are the cost of reagents such as ammonia and limestone that are used to reduce air emissions 
these variable emission mitigation costs were historically recovered through the fuel adjustment clause 
on november   the lpsc opened docket no 
x to audit the costs for the periods october through october the total amount of environmental expenses included in the audit is approximately million 
cleco power has responded to data requests from the lpsc 
these responses are currently under review by the lpsc 
the lpsc has not stated an amount of the environmental costs  if any  that would be disallowed and result in a refund to customers 
however  if a disallowance of environmental costs is ordered resulting in a refund  any such refund could affect the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
hedging and risk management activities cleco power is subject to market risk associated with fuel cost hedges relating to open natural gas contracts 
cleco has risk management policies which cannot eliminate all risk involved in its energy commodity activities 
cleco power enters into fuel cost hedge positions to mitigate the volatility in fuel costs passed through to its retail customers 
when these positions close  actual gains or losses are deferred and included in the fuel adjustment clause in the month the physical contract settles 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc 
cleco power manages its exposure to energy commodity activities by maintaining risk management policies and establishing and enforcing risk limits and risk management procedures 
these risk limits and risk management procedures cannot eliminate all risk associated with these activities  particularly if intentional misconduct is involved 
financial derivatives reforms could increase the liquidity needs and costs of cleco power s commercial trading operations 
in july  congress enacted federal legislation to reform financial markets that significantly altered how over the counter otc derivatives are regulated 
the law increased regulatory oversight of otc energy derivatives  including requiring standardized otc derivatives to be traded on registered exchanges regulated by the commodity futures trading commission cftc  imposing new and potentially higher capital and margin requirements and authorizing the establishment of overall volume and position limits 
the law gave the cftc authority to exempt end users of energy commodities which could reduce  but not eliminate  the applicability of these measures to cleco power and other end users 
these requirements could cause cleco power s future otc transactions to be more costly and have an adverse effect on its liquidity due to additional capital requirements 
in addition  by standardizing otc products  these reforms could limit the effectiveness of cleco power s hedging programs because cleco power would have less ability to tailor otc cleco corporation cleco power form k derivatives to match the precise risk it is seeking to protect 
commodity prices cleco power is subject to the fluctuation in the market prices of various commodities which may increase the cost of producing power 
cleco power purchases natural gas  petroleum coke  lignite  and coal under long term contracts and on the spot market 
historically  the markets for natural gas  petroleum coke  and coal have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
cleco power s retail and wholesale rates include a fuel adjustment clause that enables it to adjust rates for monthly fluctuations in the cost of fuel and purchased power 
however  recovery of any of these fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to  and may be disallowed as part of  a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit conducted by the lpsc or ferc 
global economic environment and uncertainty the global economic environment and uncertainty may negatively impact cleco s business and financial condition  pension plan  lenders  and customers 
the global economic environment and uncertainty may have an impact on cleco s business and financial condition 
cleco s ability to access capital markets could be severely restricted 
this could have a material adverse impact on cleco s ability to fund capital expenditures or debt service  or on cleco s flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
cleco s pension plan portfolio has experienced significant volatility due to market conditions and may experience material losses in the future 
the losses  in conjunction with plan funding requirements  could result in required pension plan contributions significantly higher and earlier than previously anticipated  which could have a material adverse impact on cleco s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
further  the current economic environment and uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on cleco s lenders or its customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to cleco or to delay payment of such obligations 
additionally  the current economic environment and uncertainty could lead to reduced electricity usage  which could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
future electricity sales cleco power s future electricity sales and corresponding base revenue and cash flows could be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
general economic conditions can negatively impact the businesses of cleco power s industrial and commercial customers  resulting in decreased power purchases and lower base revenue 
the recent recession adversely affected mwh sales due to closures and a reduction in load requirements across cleco power s industrial customer base  particularly among manufacturers of wood and paper products 
the paper industry remains vulnerable to decreasing demand for its products  and the downturn in residential home construction has also caused a significant reduction in the demand and prices for lumber and other wood products 
reduced production or the shut down of any of these customers facilities could substantially reduce cleco power s base revenue 
future electricity sales could be impacted by industrial customers switching to alternative sources of energy  including on site power generation  and retail customers consuming less electricity due to increased conservation efforts or increased electric usage efficiency 
cleco power generation facilities cleco power s generation facilities are susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements  and interruption of fuel deliveries 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel supply interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
almost one third of cleco power s net capacity is at facilities that were originally constructed before older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant expenditures to operate at peak efficiency or availability  or in compliance with environmental permits 
if cleco power fails to make adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance  cleco power risks incurring more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel or power purchase costs  and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
newer equipment  such as that installed at madison unit  can be subject to startup issues  such as failures due to immaturity of control equipment safeguards and experience with operating under forced outage conditions 
cleco power s generating facilities are fueled primarily by coal  natural gas  petroleum coke  and lignite 
the deliverability of these fuel sources may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances or lack of transportation capacity 
if the suppliers are unable to deliver the contracted volume of fuel  cleco power would have to replace any deficiency with alternative sources  which may not be as favorable and could increase the ultimate cost of fuel to customers 
fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered from customers through the fuel adjustment clause  which is subject to refund until either a prudency review or a periodic fuel audit is conducted by the lpsc 
competition for access to other natural resources  particularly oil and natural gas  could negatively impact cleco power s ability to access its lignite reserves 
land owners may grant other parties access for oil and natural gas drilling in the same area to which cleco has been granted access for lignite reserves 
placement of drilling rigs and pipelines for developing oil and gas reserves can preclude access to lignite in the same areas  making right of first access critical with respect to extracting lignite 
competition for the right of first access may need to be determined through legal processes 
additionally  cleco power could be liable for the impacts of other companies activities on lands that have been mined and reclaimed by cleco power 
loss of access to lignite reserves or the liability for impacts on reclaimed lands could have material adverse effects to the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco corporation cleco power form k reliability and infrastructure protection standards compliance cleco is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards 
fines and civil penalties are imposed on those who fail to comply with these standards 
nerc serves as the ero with authority to establish and enforce mandatory reliability and infrastructure protection standards  subject to ferc approval  for users of the nation s transmission system 
ferc enforces compliance with these standards 
new standards are being developed and existing standards are continuously being modified 
as these standards continue to be adopted and modified  they may impose additional compliance requirements on cleco power and midstream operations  which may result in an increase in capital expenditures and operating expenses 
failure to comply with these standards can result in the imposition of material fines and civil penalties 
in february  the spp re notified cleco that an audit would be conducted to determine cleco s compliance with the nerc reliability standard and critical infrastructure protection cybersecurity standard requirements 
the audit was conducted in april cleco submitted mitigation plans and evidence of remedial efforts in connection with the spp s initial findings from the audit 
cleco and the spp agreed to a financial settlement totaling less than million  which has been approved by nerc 
cleco s next scheduled audit will begin in management is unable to predict the outcome of the future audit or whether it will have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
environmental compliance cleco s costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations are significant 
the costs of compliance with new environmental laws and regulations  as well as the incurrence of incremental environmental liabilities  could be significant to the registrants 
cleco is subject to extensive environmental oversight by federal  state  and local authorities and is required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations related to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  and health and safety 
cleco also is required to obtain and comply with numerous governmental permits in operating its facilities 
existing environmental laws  regulations  and permits could be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to cleco 
for example  the epa has announced rules that regulate co and hazardous air pollutants from electric generating units 
cleco may incur significant capital expenditures or additional operating costs to comply with these revisions  reinterpretations  and new requirements 
if cleco fails to comply  it could be subject to civil or criminal liabilities and fines or may be forced to shut down or reduce production from its facilities 
cleco cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals 
environmental advocacy groups  states  other organizations  some government agencies  and the presidential administration are focusing considerable attention on the potential role in climate change from power generation facilities emissions  including co emissions 
future changes in environmental regulations governing power plant emissions could make some of cleco s electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate 
in addition  any legal obligation that would require cleco to substantially reduce its emissions beyond present levels could require extensive mitigation efforts and could raise uncertainty about the future viability of some fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generation facilities 
cleco cannot predict the outcome of pending or future legislative and rulemaking proposals 
cleco power may request recovery from its customers of its costs to comply with new environmental laws and regulations 
if the lpsc were to deny cleco power s request to recover all or part of its environmental compliance costs  there could be a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
regulatory compliance cleco operates in a highly regulated environment  and adverse regulatory decisions or changes in applicable regulations could have a material adverse effect on the registrants businesses or result in significant additional costs 
cleco s business is subject to extensive federal  state  and local energy  environmental and other laws and regulations 
the lpsc regulates cleco s retail operations  and ferc regulates cleco s wholesale operations 
the construction  planning  and siting of cleco s power plants and transmission lines also are subject to the jurisdiction of the lpsc and ferc 
additional regulatory authorities have jurisdiction over some of cleco s operations and construction projects including the epa  the us bureau of land management  the us fish and wildlife services  the us department of energy  the us army corps of engineers  the us department of homeland security  the occupational safety and health administration  the us department of transportation  the ldeq  the louisiana department of health and hospitals  the louisiana department of natural resources  the louisiana department of public safety  regional water quality boards  and various local regulatory districts 
cleco must periodically apply for licenses and permits from these various regulatory authorities and abide by their respective orders 
should cleco be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or should these regulatory authorities initiate any investigations or enforcement actions or impose penalties or disallowances on cleco  cleco s business could be adversely affected 
existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to cleco or cleco s facilities in a manner that may have a detrimental effect on the registrants business or result in significant additional costs because of cleco s need to comply with those requirements 
weather sensitivity the operating results of cleco power are affected by weather conditions and may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis 
weather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity  particularly kwh sales to residential customers 
in cleco power s service territory  demand for power typically peaks during the hot summer months 
as a result  cleco power s financial results may fluctuate on a seasonal basis 
in addition  cleco power has sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions were milder 
unusually mild weather in the future could have a material adverse impact on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
severe weather  including hurricanes and winter storms  cleco corporation cleco power form k can be destructive  causing outages and property damage that can potentially result in additional expenses and lower revenue 
extreme drought conditions can impact the availability of cooling water to support the operations of generating plants  which can also result in additional expenses and lower revenue 
retail electric service cleco power s retail electric rates and business practices are regulated by the lpsc  and reviews may result in refunds to customers 
cleco power s retail rates for residential  commercial  and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the lpsc  which conducts an annual review of cleco power s earnings and regulatory return on equity 
through  cleco power filed annual monitoring reports with the lpsc for month periods ended september in  the reports were filed for month periods ended june and september beginning in  cleco power filed the annual monitoring report for the month period ended june cleco power could be required to make a substantial refund of previously recorded revenue as a result of the lpsc review  and such refund could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
wholesale electric service cleco power s wholesale electric rates and business practices are regulated by ferc  and cleco could lose the right to sell at market based rates 
cleco power s wholesale rates are regulated by ferc  which conducts a review of cleco power s generation market power every three years in addition to each time generation capacity changes 
if ferc determines cleco power possesses generation market power in excess of certain thresholds  cleco power could lose the right to sell wholesale generation at market based rates within its control area  which could result in a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco credit ratings a downgrade in cleco corporation s or cleco power s credit rating could result in an increase in their respective borrowing costs and a reduced pool of potential investors and funding sources 
while the senior unsecured debt ratings of cleco corporation and cleco power are currently investment grade  in recent years such ratings have been downgraded or put on negative watch by moody s and standard poor s 
neither cleco corporation nor cleco power can assure that its current debt ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of its debt ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
if moody s and standard poor s were to downgrade cleco corporation s or cleco power s long term ratings  particularly below investment grade  the value of their debt securities would likely be adversely affected  and the borrowing cost of cleco corporation or cleco power  as the case may be  would likely increase 
in addition  cleco corporation or cleco power  as the case may be  would likely be required to pay higher interest rates in future debt financings and be subject to more onerous debt covenants  and its pool of potential investors and funding sources could decrease 
holding company cleco corporation is a holding company  and its ability to meet its debt obligations and pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the cash generated by its subsidiaries 
cleco corporation is a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its subsidiaries 
substantially all of cleco s consolidated assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  cleco corporation s ability to meet its debt obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock is largely dependent upon the cash generated by these subsidiaries 
cleco corporation s subsidiaries are separate and distinct entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on cleco corporation s debt or to make any funds available for such payment 
in addition  cleco corporation s subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to cleco corporation may be restricted by their obligations to holders of their outstanding securities and to other general business creditors 
cleco corporation s right to receive any assets of any subsidiary  and therefore the right of its creditors to participate in those assets  will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
in addition  even if cleco corporation were a creditor of any subsidiary  its rights as a creditor would be subordinated to any security interest in the assets of that subsidiary and any indebtedness of the subsidiary senior to that held by cleco corporation 
moreover  cleco power  cleco corporation s principal subsidiary  is subject to regulation by the lpsc  which may impose limits on the amount of dividends that cleco power may pay cleco corporation 
midstream generation facility midstream s generation facility is susceptible to unplanned outages  significant maintenance requirements  interruption of fuel deliveries  and transmission constraints 
the operation of power generation facilities involves many risks  including breakdown or failure of equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
if adequate expenditures for equipment maintenance are not made  a facility may incur more frequent unplanned outages  higher than anticipated operating and maintenance expenditures  increased fuel costs  and potentially the loss of revenue related to competitive opportunities 
midstream s generation facility is fueled by natural gas 
the deliverability of this fuel source may be constrained due to such factors as higher demand  production shortages  weather related disturbances  or lack of transportation capacity 
due to midstream s generation facility s location on the transmission grid  midstream relies on one main supplier of electric transmission when accessing external power markets 
however  at times  physical constraints limit the amount of power this transmission provider can deliver 
cleco power s rates the lpsc and ferc regulate the rates that cleco power can charge its customers 
cleco power s ongoing financial viability depends on its ability cleco corporation cleco power form k to recover its costs from its lpsc jurisdictional customers in a timely manner through its lpsc approved rates and its ability to pass through to its ferc customers in rates its ferc authorized revenue requirements 
cleco power s financial viability also depends on its ability to recover in rates an adequate return on capital  including long term debt and equity 
if cleco power is unable to recover any material amount of its costs in rates in a timely manner or recover an adequate return on capital  the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
cleco power s revenues and earnings are substantially affected by regulatory proceedings known as rate cases 
during those cases  the lpsc or ferc determines cleco power s rate base  depreciation rates  operation and maintenance costs  and administrative and general costs that cleco power may recover from its retail or wholesale customers through its rates 
these proceedings may examine  among other things  the prudence of cleco power s operation and maintenance practices  level of subject expenditures  allowed rates of return  and previously incurred capital expenditures 
the lpsc and ferc have the authority to disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred 
these regulatory proceedings typically involve multiple parties  including governmental bodies and officials  consumer advocacy groups  and various consumers of energy  who have differing concerns but who have the common objective of limiting rate increases or reducing rates 
rate cases generally have long timelines  which may be limited by statute 
decisions are typically subject to appeal  potentially leading to additional uncertainty 
alternative generation technology changes in technology may negatively impact the value of the cleco power and midstream generation facilities 
a basic premise of cleco s business is that generating electricity at central power plants achieves economies of scale and produces electricity at a relatively low price 
there are alternative technologies to produce electricity  most notably fuel cells  microturbines  wind turbines  and photovoltaic solar cells 
many companies and organizations conduct research and development activities to seek improvements in alternative technologies 
it is possible that advances will reduce the cost of alternative methods of electricity production to a level that is equal to or below that of most central station production 
also  as new technologies are developed and become available  the quantity and pattern of electricity usage by customers could decline  with a corresponding decline in revenues derived by generators 
in addition  the current presidential administration and certain members of the us congress have voiced support for such alternative energy sources 
as a result  the value of the cleco power and midstream generation facilities could be significantly reduced 
insurance cleco s insurance coverage may not be sufficient 
cleco currently has general liability and property insurance in place to cover certain of its facilities in amounts that it considers appropriate 
such policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles and do not include business interruption coverage 
insurance coverage may not be available in the future at current costs or on commercially reasonable terms  and the insurance proceeds received for any loss of  or any damage to  any of cleco s facilities may not be sufficient to restore the loss or damage without negative impact on cleco s results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
like other utilities that serve coastal regions  cleco does not have insurance covering its transmission and distribution system  other than substations  because it believes such insurance to be cost prohibitive 
in the future  cleco may not be able to recover the costs incurred in restoring transmission and distribution properties following hurricanes or other natural disasters through issuance of storm recovery bonds or a change in cleco power s regulated rates or otherwise  or any such recovery may not be timely granted 
therefore  cleco may not be able to restore any loss of  or damage to  any of its transmission and distribution properties without negative impact on its results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
litigation the outcome of legal proceedings cannot be predicted 
an adverse finding could have a material adverse effect on the registrants financial condition 
the registrants are party to various litigation matters arising out of their business operations 
the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined  nor  in many cases  can the liability that could potentially result from a negative outcome in each case presently be reasonably estimated 
the liability that the registrants may ultimately incur with respect to any of these cases in the event of a negative outcome may be in excess of amounts currently reserved and insured against with respect to such matters and  as a result  these matters may have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
taxes changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact the registrants financial condition 
the registrants make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities 
these tax obligations include income  franchise  real estate  sales and use  and employment related taxes 
these judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken 
changes in federal  state  or local tax laws  adverse tax audit results  or adverse tax rulings on positions taken by the registrants could negatively affect their results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
health care reform cleco may experience increased costs arising from health care reform 
in march  congress passed  and the president signed  the ppaca 
this law may have a significant impact on health care providers  insurers  and others associated with the health care industry 
cleco is continuing to evaluate the impact of this comprehensive law on its business and has made the required changes to its health plan for federal and state governments may propose other health care initiatives and revisions to the health care and health insurance systems 
it is uncertain what legislative programs  if any  will be adopted in cleco corporation cleco power form k the future  or what action congress or state legislatures may take regarding other health care reform proposals or legislation 
although the law has passed  many regulations have yet to be written  therefore  management cannot quantify the impact of these regulations  including those relating to the establishment of exchanges and the applicability of excise taxes on excess health benefits 
the new regulations may have a material adverse effect on the registrants results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
technology and terrorism threats man made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may negatively impact the registrants operating results 
man made problems such as computer viruses or terrorism may disrupt the registrants operations and harm the registrants operating results 
the registrants operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
despite the implementation of security measures  all of the registrants technology systems are vulnerable to disability or failures due to hacking  viruses  acts of war or terrorism  and other causes 
if the registrants technology systems were to fail and the registrants were unable to recover in a timely way  the registrants would be unable to fulfill critical business functions  which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
in addition  the cleco power and midstream generation plants  fuel storage facilities  transmission  and distribution facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt the registrants ability to produce or distribute some portion of their energy products 
any such disruption could result in a material decrease in revenues and significant additional costs to repair and insure the registrants assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the registrants business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries and create further uncertainties or otherwise materially harm the registrants business  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
cleco power unsecured and unsubordinated obligations cleco power s unsecured and unsubordinated obligations  including  without limitation  its senior notes  will be effectively subordinated to any secured debt of cleco power and the debt and any preferred equity of any of cleco power s subsidiaries
