we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of our three most recent fiscal years and our financial condition at december  except for historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a leading global provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit board pcb products and backplane assemblies pcbs populated with electronic components  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we provide our customers time to market and advanced technology products and offer a one stop manufacturing solution to customers from engineering support to prototype development through final volume production 
we serve a diversified customer base in various markets throughout the world  including manufacturers of networking communications infrastructure products  touch screen tablets and mobile media devices cellular phones and smartphones 
we also serve high end computing  commercial aerospace defense  and industrial medical industries 
our customers include both original equipment manufacturers oems and electronic manufacturing services ems providers 
in april  we acquired from meadville all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of four of its subsidiaries 
these four companies and their respective subsidiaries collectively referred to as the pcb subsidiaries  comprised meadville s pcb manufacturing and distribution business 
see note in our consolidated financial statements 
based on customer inputs regarding new product introductions and overall prospects for our business  the majority of our net sales for are expected in the second half of the year 
additionally  in january we temporarily closed a significant facility  dongguan shengyi electronics ltd 
sye  located in dongguan  china  for repairs and upgrades 
the closure is expected to last until approximately june a majority of sye s production and a significant portion of its work force will be temporarily transferred to our other facilities located in south china during this period 
we estimate net sales in our asia pacific operating segment will be reduced by approximately million to million in each of the first two quarters of as a result of this temporary closure 
while our customers include both oem and ems providers  we measure customers based on oem companies as they are the ultimate end customers 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed orders of  or more in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately  customers and as of december  we had approximately  customers 
sales to our largest customers accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated 
end markets aerospace defense cellular phone computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other networking communications other total 
table of contents sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
for pcbs  we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
we also deliver a significant percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we typically receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of pcbs and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective pcbs and backplane assemblies 
we record an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we generally do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  with the exception of the supply arrangement to purchase laminate and prepregs from a related party controlled by a significant shareholder  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  bad debt expense  gains or losses on the sale or disposal of property  plant and equipment  and acquisition related expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and requires management to make judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has 
table of contents discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  derivative instruments and hedging activities  realizability of deferred tax assets  and determining self insurance reserves 
allowance for doubtful accounts we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and judgments as to expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
inventories in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
when the market value of inventory is less than the carrying value  the inventory cost is written down to their estimated net realizable value thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements with those customers 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
sales returns and allowances we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenue upon shipment 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale using our judgment based on historical information and anticipated returns as a result of current period sales 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
long lived assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  definite lived intangibles  and goodwill 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
as necessary  we make judgments regarding future cash flow forecasts in the assessment of impairment 
during the fourth quarter of each year  and when events and circumstances warrant an evaluation  we perform our annual impairment assessment of goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on discounted cash flows and market approach analyses as considered necessary and consider factors such as the state of the economy  reduced expectations for future cash flows coupled with a decline in the market price of our stock and market capitalization for a sustained period as indicators for potential goodwill impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of december   our assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the carrying value of goodwill for our shanghai backplane assembly reporting unit  in our north america segment  was in excess of its fair value  and therefore goodwill for the north america segment was impaired 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we also assess other long lived assets  specifically definite lived intangibles and property  plant and equipment  for potential impairment given similar impairment indicators 
when indicators of impairment exist related to our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets  we use an estimate of the undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether the carrying amount of the assets is recoverable 
measurement of the amount of impairment  if any  is based upon the difference between the asset s carrying value and estimated fair value 
fair value is determined through various valuation techniques  including market and income approaches as considered necessary  which involve judgments related to future cash flows and the application of the appropriate valuation model 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the asia pacific operating segment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
derivative instruments and hedging activities as a matter of policy  we use derivatives for risk management purposes  and we do not use derivatives for speculative purposes 
derivatives are typically entered into as hedges of changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates  and other risks 
when we determine to designate a derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge  we formally document the hedging relationship and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  the hedging instrument  the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged  how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed  and a description of the method of measuring ineffectiveness 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivative that is used in hedging transactions is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with measurement at fair value 
fair value of the derivative instruments is determined using pricing models developed based on the underlying swap interest rate  foreign currency exchange rates  and other observable market data as appropriate 
the values are also adjusted to reflect nonperformance risk of the counterparty and the company  as necessary 
for derivatives that are designated as a cash flow hedge  changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  to the extent the derivative is effective at offsetting the changes in cash flow being hedged until the hedged item affects earnings 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded in earnings each period 
income taxes deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized based on our estimate of future taxable income 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to establish a valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 
in addition  we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
additionally  our calculations of income taxes are based on our interpretations of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
self insurance we are primarily self insured in north america for group health insurance and worker s compensation benefits provided to our us employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against annual claims at the individual and aggregate level 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not reported at the end of each 
table of contents reporting period 
we use our judgment using our historical claim data and information and analysis provided by actuarial and claim advisors  our insurance carriers and brokers on an annual basis to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to individual insured stop loss coverage for both programs which is  per individual 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 
results of operations the year ended december  does not include the results of operations from our acquired pcb subsidiaries  as the acquisition occurred on april  included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  are days of results of operations for the asia pacific operations for the period from april  through december  the acquisition has had and will continue to have a significant effect on our operations as discussed in the various comparisons noted below 
the following table sets forth the relationship of various items to net sales in our consolidated statement of operations year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles impairment of goodwill impairment of long lived assets restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense other  net total other expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest net income attributable to ttm technologies  inc stockholders prior to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  we had two operating segments  pcb manufacturing and backplane assembly  consistent with the nature of our operations 
due to the acquisition  we reassessed our operating segments and now manage our worldwide operations based on two geographic operating segments north america  which consists of seven domestic pcb fabrication plants  including a facility that provides follow on value added services primarily for one of the pcb fabrication plants  and one backplane assembly plant in shanghai  china  which is managed in conjunction with our us operations and its related european sales support infrastructure  and asia pacific  which consists of the pcb subsidiaries and their seven pcb fabrication plants  which include a substrate facility 
each segment operates predominantly in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar customized products for our customers and use similar means of product distribution in their respective geographic regions 

table of contents the following table compares net sales by reportable segment for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands net sales north america asia pacific total sales inter segment sales total net sales net sales total net sales increased by million  or  from  million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  sales related to the north america segment decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decline in net sales reflects a decrease in pcb sales volume of and the closure of our hayward  california backplane assembly facility  partially offset by a increase in average pcb selling price and increased sales at our other backplane assembly facilities 
sales for the asia pacific segment  excluding inter segment sales  increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to the inclusion of a full year of asia pacific net sales in compared to months in due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april in addition  we experienced an increase in pcb prices of approximately resulting from a product mix shift from standard hdi and conventional pcbs to advanced hdi pcbs  partially offset by a decrease of approximately in daily pcb production 
net sales from advanced hdi pcb s as a percentage of asia pacific net sales increased from approximately for the year ended december  to approximately for the year ended december  total net sales increased million  from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  sales for the north america segment remained consistent with net sales of million for the year ended december  and net sales of million for the year ended december  sales volume at a number of our facilities increased due to an improved economy and the transfer of work from our closed facilities partially offset by the lost revenue resulting from the closure of our los angeles  california facility in november  and our hayward  california facility in march the revenue reflects a decrease of in our average pcb selling price from the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  and an increase in pcb volume of from the year ended december  as compared to december  due to the improved economy 
sales for the asia pacific segment  excluding inter segment sales  increased by million due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april the inter segment sales for the years ended december  and are sales from the asia pacific operating segment to the north america operating segment 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold increased by million from million for the year ended december  to  million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold related to the north america segment decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower sales volume and lower labor costs at several pcb manufacturing plants 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold for the north america segment increased slightly from for the year ended december  to for the year ended 
table of contents december  cost of goods sold related to the asia pacific segment increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of costs following our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april the increase in costs was also due to higher labor costs in asia and increased overhead  mainly driven by higher depreciation expense 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold related to the asia pacific segment increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  for the reasons mentioned above 
cost of goods sold increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold for the north america segment decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to reduced overhead from the facility closures discussed above  as well as lower direct material costs due to lower volumes of backplane assemblies  which inherently have a higher material content  partially offset by increased pcb production volume 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   primarily due to cost savings from our closed facilities and increased absorption of fixed costs across a smaller plant footprint following the closure of our los angeles and hayward  california facilities 
cost of goods sold related to the asia pacific segment were million for the year ended december  due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april gross profit as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the overall gross margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher labor costs in china and increases in depreciation expense in our asia pacific segment 
gross profit increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
overall gross margin increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  due primarily to historically higher overall profit margins for the asia pacific segment  which were primarily attributable to that segment s sale of hdi pcbs  partially offset by million of increased costs in the asia pacific segment due to the fair value mark up of acquired inventory of the pcb subsidiaries 
overall gross margin also increased due to cost savings from our closed us facilities and higher fixed cost absorption on higher volumes in our north america segment 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in selling and marketing expense for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales is due to the inclusion of a full year of results for the asia pacific segment  which has lower selling expenses than our north america segment 
selling and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
as a percentage of net sales  selling and marketing expenses were for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decline in selling and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales is due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april  which have lower selling expenses than our north america segment 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  
table of contents the increase in expense for the year ended december  primarily relates to inclusion of a full year of results for the asia pacific segment 
the decrease in general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales is related to million of acquisition related costs incurred in general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase in expense primarily relates to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april amortization of definite lived intangibles intangible amortization expense increased by million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  due to the inclusion of a full year of results for the asia pacific operating segment 
intangible amortization expense increased million from million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  to million  or of net sales  for the year ended december  the increase was due to our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries in april identifiable intangible assets include customer relationships  trade name and order backlog 
impairment of goodwill during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million related to our shanghai backplane assembly facility  which was part of our acquisition of tyco s pcb business 
as a result of our annual goodwill impairment testing  giving consideration to factors such as a weakening demand for this facility s products  as well as price pressure from a key telecommunications infrastructure customer and reduced expectations for future cash flows as indicators for potential goodwill impairment  we determined that the carrying value of our shanghai backplane assembly reporting unit  which is included as a part of our north america operating segment  exceeded its implied fair value  resulting in an impairment charge 
impairment of long lived assets during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge in the amount of million to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the asia pacific operating segment 
the impairment charge includes million related to manufacturing equipment held for use at a plant acquired by meadville in we had previously reduced the carrying value for some of these assets during our purchase price allocation related to the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries 
weaker than expected operating performance at this manufacturing plant in the first six months of  resulting from a downturn in the profitability of its products as well as a reduction in expected future demand for these products  resulted in an asset impairment during the second quarter of based on the undiscounted cash flows for this plant  an impairment of the manufacturing assets was indicated 
in addition  the manufacturing equipment at this plant cannot be used at our other manufacturing sites 
the fair value of these manufacturing assets was determined using a discounted cash flow model over their remaining useful life with the impairment being the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the asset group 
the impairment charge also includes million related to manufacturing equipment that  due to the change in market conditions noted above  has become or is expected to become technologically obsolete 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we revised our classification of these assets to assets held for sale or disposal 
the fair value of these assets was determined using third party quotes or other estimates of salvage value  and the assets carrying value was written down to salvage value 
the new carrying value of the assets held for sale or disposal is approximately million  which is included in machinery and equipment in property  plant and equipment  net in the accompanying consolidated condensed balance sheet 
impairment of long lived assets of million for the year ended december  related to the further reduction in the value of the dallas  oregon facility to record the estimated fair value less cost to sell given the then current market conditions 
we sold this facility in july impairment of long lived assets for the year ended december  in the amount of million was related to the closure of the redmond  washington and los angeles  california production facilities  and the 
table of contents then pending closure of our hayward  california facility  and consists of machinery and equipment 
additionally  during the year ended december  we reduced the value of the redmond  washington and dallas  oregon buildings  which were classified as assets held for sale  by million to record the estimated fair value less costs to sell given current market conditions 
other income expense total other expense  net increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in total other expense  net for the year ended december  was primarily due to interest expense related to the debt assumed at the date of acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  partially offset by a realized gain of million related to the early settlement of a related party financing obligation related to the remaining interest in meadville aspocomp bvi holdings ltd  as well as approximately million of foreign currency transaction gains 
total other expense  net increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in total other expense  net was primarily due to interest expense related to the debt assumed at the date of acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  as well as increased amortization of costs related to the issuance of this debt 
for the year ended december   the increase in interest expense was partially offset by million of foreign currency transaction gains 
income taxes the provision for income taxes remained consistent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased in primarily due to the impairment of long lived assets  for which a tax benefit was not recorded  partially offset by an increase in total earnings generated in lower tax jurisdictions  which have a lower effective tax rate than our north america operations 
in addition  our tax rate benefited from research and development credits in our north america operations 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the us federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  tax rates in china and hong kong  generation of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
certain foreign losses generated are not more than likely to be realizable  and thus no income tax benefit has been recognized on these losses 
additionally  as of december  and  we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
based on our forecast for future taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods 
the provision for income taxes increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily due to higher pre tax income 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  our effective tax rate decreased in primarily due to the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  which have a lower effective tax rate than our north america operations  partially offset by the impact of the non deductibility of certain transaction costs 
additionally  certain foreign losses generated are not likely to be realizable  and thus no income tax benefit has been recognized on these losses 
our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the us federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  tax rates in china and hong kong  generation of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items 
additionally  as of december   we had net deferred income tax assets of approximately million 
based on our forecast for future taxable earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the deferred income tax assets in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  the issuance of convertible notes and  more recently  the issuance of term and revolving debt 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance capital expenditures  meet debt service requirements  fund working capital requirements and finance acquisitions 
we anticipate that servicing debt  financing capital expenditures  funding working capital requirements  and 
table of contents acquisitions will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
we have approximately million of debt payments due in the next months 
as of february   there was approximately million outstanding and approximately million available on our revolving loan 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million compared to million as of december  this decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to an increase in current liabilities for debt repayments due in the next months as of december  as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  million of which was located in asia 
cash and cash equivalents located in our asia pacific operating segment are expected to remain for use in local operations 
cash and cash equivalents located in our backplane assembly facility in shanghai  china  which is managed in conjunction with our us operations  are expected to be repatriated 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million of which approximately million relates to our asia pacific segment 
it will fund capital equipment purchases to increase production capacity  especially for advanced hdi and rigid flex pcb manufacturing  expand our technological capabilities and replace aging equipment 
additionally  our asia pacific segment estimates that approximately million of the million in planned capital expenditures will be used for the repair and upgrade of our sye facility in dongguan  china  as discussed in our results of operations 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  cash on hand and cash available from borrowings under our existing credit arrangements will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated capital expenditure  debt service  working capital  and acquisition needs for the next months 
we believe that there is minimal risk of not being in compliance with our existing financial covenants so as to accelerate the maturity of the credit agreement 
however  the semiannual repayments on our existing term loan increase as the related debt nears maturity in should we choose to maintain a significant level of annual capital expenditures or to pursue an acquisition during the next two years  refinancing of our existing debt would likely be necessary 
any such refinancing would seek to address all possible demands on our liquidity listed above 
in the event we decide to engage in a significant refinancing transaction  the adequacy of our liquidity will depend on our ability to achieve access to capital markets 
credit agreement on april   in conjunction with the acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  we became a party to a credit agreement credit agreement  entered into on november  by certain pcb subsidiaries  which are now our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
the credit agreement was put in place in contemplation of the acquisition in order to refinance the then existing credit facilities of the pcb subsidiaries 
the credit agreement consists of a million senior secured term loan  an million senior secured revolving loan  a million factoring facility  and an million letters of credit facility  all of which mature on november  the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the assets of the pcb subsidiaries 
the company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the full and punctual payment of all obligations of the pcb subsidiaries under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate of libor term election by company plus an applicable interest margin 
borrowings bear interest at a rate of libor plus under the term loan  libor plus under the revolving loan  and libor plus under the factoring facility 
at december   the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 
borrowings under the credit agreement are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include maintaining maximum total leverage ratios and minimum net worth  current assets  and interest coverage ratios at both the company and pcb subsidiaries level 
during the years ended december  and  we entered into amendments to the credit agreement that amended certain of the credit agreement financial covenants related to us and our pcb subsidiaries 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants 
we are required to pay a commitment fee of per annum on any unused portion of loan or facility under the credit agreement 
for both of the years ended december  and  we incurred million in commitment fees related to the unused portion of the loan or facility under the credit agreement 
as of 
table of contents december   the remaining term loan of million and million of letters of credit were outstanding 
available borrowing capacity under the revolving loan and factoring facility was million and million  respectively 
as of february   there was approximately million outstanding and approximately million available on our revolving loan 
bank loans bank loans are made up of bank lines of credit in mainland china and are used for working capital and capital investment for our mainland china facilities 
these facilities are denominated in either us dollars or chinese renminbi rmb  with interest rates tied to either libor or people s bank of china rates with a margin adjustment 
these bank loans expire at various dates through august convertible notes in may  we issued million of convertible notes 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears on may and november of each year 
the convertible notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally to our future unsecured senior indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our future subordinated indebtedness 
offering expenses are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
at any time prior to november   holders may convert their convertible notes into cash and  if applicable  into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment  under the following circumstances during any calendar quarter beginning after june  and only during such calendar quarter  if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day of such preceding calendar quarter  during the five business day period after any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per note for each day of that consecutive trading day period is less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on such day  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions described in the prospectus supplement related to the convertible notes  which can be found on the sec s website at www 
sec 
gov 
as of december   none of the conversion criteria had been met 
on or after november  until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day preceding the may  maturity of the convertible notes  holders may convert their notes at any time  regardless of the foregoing circumstances 
upon conversion  for each  principal amount of notes  we will pay cash for the lesser of the conversion value or  and shares of our common stock  if any  based on a daily conversion value calculated on a proportionate basis for each day of the applicable trading day observation period 
the maximum number of shares issuable upon conversion  subject to certain conversion rate adjustments  would be approximately million shares 
we are not permitted to redeem the notes at any time prior to maturity 
in the event of a fundamental change or certain default events  as defined in the prospectus supplement  holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into a convertible note hedge and warrant transaction call spread transaction  with respect to our common stock 
the convertible note hedge  which cost an aggregate of million and was recorded  net of tax  as a reduction of additional paid in capital  consists of our option to purchase up to million shares of common stock at a price of per share 
this option expires on may  and can only be executed upon the conversion of the convertible notes 
additionally  we sold warrants for the option to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrants expire ratably beginning august through february the proceeds from the sale of warrants of million was recorded as an addition to additional paid in capital 
the call spread transaction has no effect on the terms of the convertible notes and reduces potential dilution by effectively increasing the conversion price of the convertible notes to per share of our common stock 

table of contents other letters of credit in addition to the letters of credit obtained by the pcb subsidiaries pursuant to the credit agreement  we maintain several letters of credit a million standby letter of credit expiring on december  associated with our insured workers compensation program  a million standby letter of credit expiring on february  related to the lease for one of our production facilities  and various other letters of credits aggregating to approximately million related to purchases of machinery and equipment with various expiration dates through june contractual obligations and commitments the following table provides information on our contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations convertible debt obligations interest on debt obligations interest rate swap liabilities foreign currency forward contract liabilities equipment payables purchase obligations operating lease commitments total contractual obligations unrecognized uncertain tax benefits of million are not included in the table above as we are not sure when the amount will be paid 
estimated environmental liabilities of million  not included in the table above  are accrued and recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
seasonality as a result of the product and customer mix of our asia pacific operating segment  a portion of our revenue is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
these fluctuations include seasonal patterns in the computer and cellular phone industry  which together have become a significant portion of the end markets that we serve 
this seasonality typically results in higher net sales in the third quarter due to end customer demand for fourth quarter sales of consumer electronics products 
seasonal fluctuations also include the chinese new year holiday in the first quarter  which typically results in lower net sales 
in addition  our accounting calendar causes the first quarter of the fiscal year to have fewer days than the other quarters  especially the fourth quarter 
in some cases  the number of days can differ by as many as ten days between the first and fourth quarters  which can cause significantly lower first quarter sales 

table of contents impact of inflation we believe that our results of operations are not materially impacted by moderate changes in the inflation rate as we expect that we generally will be able to continue to pass along component price increases to our customers 
severe increases in inflation  however  could affect the global and us economies and have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may not be able to pass along to our major customers significant increases in the costs of gold  copper and other commodities used in our products  which could have a material adverse impact on our gross profit margins 
recently issued accounting standards on january   we adopted asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires companies to make new disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements including significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value hierarchies and information on purchases  sales  issuance and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition in multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this standard eliminates the residual method of revenue allocation by requiring entities to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of the delivered goods and services based on a selling price hierarchy 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to an accounting standard related to comprehensive income  whereby an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the amendments on january   and our adoption is not expected to have a material impact 
in september  the fasb issued an update to an accounting standard related to testing goodwill for impairment whereby an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the amendments on january  and our adoption is not expected to have a material impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business operations we are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we have not experienced any losses to date on any derivative financial instruments due to counterparty credit risk 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward positions  both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with their underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 

table of contents interest rate risk our business is exposed to interest rate risk resulting from fluctuations in interest rates 
our interest expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of libor and the people s bank of china interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
increases in interest rates would increase interest expenses relating to the outstanding variable rate borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries and increase the cost of debt 
fluctuations in interest rates can also lead to significant fluctuations in the fair value of the debt obligations 
on april   we entered into a two year pay fixed  receive floating month libor  amortizing interest rate swap arrangement with an initial notional amount of million  for the period beginning april  and ending on april  the interest rate swap applies a fixed interest rate against the first interest payments of a portion of the million term loan for this period 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases to zero over its term  consistent with our risk management objectives 
the notional value underlying the hedge at december  was million 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the company will pay a fixed rate of and will receive floating month libor during the swap period 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings as interest expense 
no ineffectiveness was recognized for the year ended december  at inception  the fair value of the interest rate swap was zero 
as of december  and  the fair value of the swap was recorded as a liability of million and million  respectively  in other long term liabilities 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated condensed balance sheet 
during the year ended december   the interest rate swap increased interest expense by million 
there was no impact to interest expense for the year ended december  as the interest rate swap did not hedge interest payments until the period beginning april  we have designated this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 
we also  through our acquisition of the pcb subsidiaries  assumed a long term pay fixed  receive floating month libor  amortizing interest rate swap arrangement with an initial notional amount of million  for the period beginning october  and ending on july  the notional amount of the interest rate swap amortizes to zero over its term  consistent with our risk management objectives 
the notional value underlying the hedge at december  was million 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  we will pay a fixed rate of and will receive floating month libor during the swap period 
as the borrowings attributable to this interest rate swap were paid off upon acquisition  we did not designate this interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge 
as of december  and  the fair value of the swap was recorded as a liability of million in other accrued expenses and million in other long term liabilities  respectively 
the change in fair value of this interest rate swap is recorded as other  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   approximately of our long term debt was based on fixed rates  including notional amounts related to interest rate swaps 
based on our borrowings as of december   an assumed change in variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by million 
foreign currency risks we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar as a normal part of the reporting process 
our asia pacific operations utilize the chinese renminbi rmb and the hong kong dollar hkd as the functional currencies  which results in us recording a translation adjustment that is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
our foreign exchange exposure results primarily from employee related and other costs of running operations in foreign countries  foreign currency denominated purchases and translation of balance sheet accounts denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary foreign exchange exposure is to the rmb 
we do not generally engage in hedging to manage foreign currency risk related to revenue and expenses denominated in rmb and hkd nor do we currently use derivative instruments to reduce exposure to foreign currency risk for loans due from our foreign subsidiaries 
however  we may consider the use of derivatives in the future 
in general  our prc customers pay us in rmb  which partially mitigates this foreign currency exchange risk 

table of contents we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and to reduce the volatility of purchases and other obligations generated in currencies other than the functional currencies 
our foreign subsidiaries may at times purchase forward exchange contracts to manage their foreign currency risk in relation to particular purchases or obligations  such as the related party financing obligation arising from the put call option to purchase the remaining of a majority owned subsidiary  which was settled in june when the put call option was settled in cash  and certain purchases of machinery denominated in foreign currencies other than our foreign functional currency 
the notional amount of the foreign exchange contracts at december  was approximately million 
we have designated certain of these foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges  with the exception of the foreign exchange contracts in relation to the related party financing obligation  which was settled in june in this instance  the hedged item was a recognized liability subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses and  therefore  changes in the hedged item due to foreign currency exchange rates were already recorded in earnings 
therefore  hedge accounting was not applied
