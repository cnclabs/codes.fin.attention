table of contents supervision and regulation general capital one financial corporation is a bank holding company bhc under section of the bank holding company act of  as amended usc the bhc act and is subject to the requirements of the bhc act  including its capital adequacy standards and limitations on our nonbanking activities 
we are also subject to supervision  examination and regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve 
permissible activities for a bhc include those activities that are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto  such as consumer lending and other activities that have been approved by the federal reserve by regulation or order 
certain servicing activities are also permissible for a bhc if conducted for or on behalf of the bhc or any of its affiliates 
impermissible activities for bhcs include activities that are related to commerce such as retail sales of nonfinancial products 
under federal reserve policy  we are expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to any banks that we control  including the banks and ing bank  and to commit resources to support them 
on may   we became a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act amendments to the bhc act the glba 
the glba removed many of the restrictions on the activities of bhcs that become financial holding companies 
a financial holding company  and the nonbank companies under its control  are permitted to engage in activities considered financial in nature including  for example  insurance underwriting  agency sales and brokerage  securities underwriting and dealing and merchant banking activities  incidental to financial activities or complementary to financial activities if the federal reserve determines that they pose no risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general 
our election to become a financial holding company under the glba certifies that the depository institutions we control meet certain criteria  including capital  management and community reinvestment act cra requirements 
effective july   under amendments to the bhc act enacted under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act  capital one financial corporation also must be well capitalized and well managed 
if we were to fail to continue to meet the criteria for financial holding company status  we could  depending on which requirements we failed to meet  face restrictions on new financial activities or acquisitions or be required to discontinue existing activities that are not generally permissible for bank holding companies 
the banks are national associations chartered under the laws of the united states  the deposits of which are insured by the deposit insurance fund the dif of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic up to applicable limits 
ing bank is a federal savings bank chartered under the laws of the united states  the deposits of which are also insured by the dif 
in addition to regulatory requirements imposed as a result of cobna s international operations discussed below  the banks and ing bank are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  the fdic and  effective july   by the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb 
we are also registered as a financial institution holding company under virginia law and  as such  we are subject to periodic examination by virginia s bureau of financial institutions 
we also face regulation in the international jurisdictions in which we conduct business see below under regulation of international business by non us authorities 
regulation of business activities the activities of the banks and ing bank as consumer lenders also are subject to regulation under various federal laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting 
table of contents act the fcra  the cra and the servicemembers civil relief act  as well as under various state laws 
depending on the underlying issue and applicable law  regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and  in certain cases  to order banks to compensate injured borrowers 
borrowers may also have a private right of action for certain violations 
federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of a bank to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers 
these laws may affect the ability of banks to collect outstanding balances 
new regulations of consumer lending activities the credit card act amending the truth in lending act enacted in may  and related changes to regulation z  impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and update the disclosures required for open end credit 
overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent  and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained 
the amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation 
the credit card act also significantly restricts the ability of a card issuer to increase rates charged on pre existing card balances 
card issuers are generally prohibited from raising rates on pre existing balances when generally prevailing interest rates change 
moreover  the circumstances under which a card issuer can raise the interest rate on pre existing balances of a customer whose risk of default increases are restricted 
payments above the minimum payment must be allocated first to balances with the highest interest rate 
the amount of fees charged to credit card accounts with lower credit lines is limited 
a consumer s ability to pay must be taken into account before issuing credit or increasing credit limits 
state consumer financial laws the dodd frank act created a new independent supervisory body  the cfpb that is the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes 
state attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the cfpb 
state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the national bank act under the existing standard set forth in the supreme court decision in barnett bank of marion county  na v 
nelson  which preempts any state law that significantly interferes with or impairs banking powers 
occ determinations of such preemption  however  must be on a case by case basis  and courts reviewing the occ s preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review 
these laws may affect the ability of the banks and ing bank to collect outstanding balances 
mortgage lending the dodd frank act prescribes additional disclosure requirements and substantive limitations on our mortgage lending activities 
most of these provisions require the issuance of regulations by the cfpb or other federal agencies before they become effective 
though we do not expect the resulting regulations to have a material impact on our operations  one new requirement under the dodd frank act  the requirement for mortgage loan securitizers to retain a portion of the economic risk associated with certain mortgage loans  could impact the type and amount of mortgage loans we offer  depending on the final regulations 
debit interchange fees the dodd frank act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction 
in june  the federal reserve adopted a final rule and an interim final rule implementing the portion of the dodd frank act that limits interchange fees received by a debit card issuer 
the final rule limits interchange fees per debit card transaction to 
plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provides  through the interim final rule  for an additional 
fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements 

table of contents dividends  stock repurchases and transfers of funds in november  the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar 
under the rules  bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions 
the purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress 
as part of its evaluation of a capital plan  the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan  the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters 
traditionally  dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet our other obligations 
there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks and ing bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
in general  federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit  without first obtaining regulatory approval  insured depository institutions  such as the banks and ing bank  from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet applicable capital adequacy standards 
capital adequacy the banks and ing bank are subject to capital adequacy guidelines adopted by federal banking regulators 
for a further discussion of the capital adequacy guidelines  see md a capital management and note regulatory and capital adequacy 
the banks and ing bank exceeded minimum regulatory requirements under these guidelines as of december  fdicia and prompt corrective action in general  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia subjects banks to significantly increased regulation and supervision 
among other things  fdicia requires federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action for banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
fdicia establishes five capital ratio levels well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under applicable regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and is not subject to any supervisory agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it maintains a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for certain highly rated institutions  and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
the three undercapitalized categories are based upon the amount by which a bank falls below the ratios applicable to adequately capitalized institutions 
the capital categories are determined solely for purposes of applying fdicia s prompt corrective action provisions  and such capital categories may not constitute an accurate representation of the banks or ing bank s overall financial condition or prospects 
as of december   each of the banks and ing bank met the requirements for a well capitalized institution 

table of contents as an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions  fdicia requires regulators to establish certain non capital safety and soundness standards 
the standards relate generally to operations and management  asset quality  interest rate exposure and executive compensation 
the agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards 
enhanced prudential standards and other requirements under the dodd frank act with the enactment of the dodd frank act  because we are a bank holding company with consolidated assets of billion or greater a covered company  we are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards  including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council the council and implemented by the federal reserve and other regulators 
as a result  we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions  including risk based capital requirements  leverage limits and liquidity requirements 
the council also may issue recommendations to the federal reserve or other primary financial regulatory agency to apply new or heightened standards to risky financial activities or practices 
in december  the federal reserve released proposed rules beginning to implement the enhanced prudential standards 
if finalized as proposed  we will be subject to new requirements regarding liquidity management  risk management  single counterparty credit limits and annual stress tests conducted by the federal reserve  and we will be required to conduct our own semiannual stress tests 
the proposal also implements an early remediation framework  under which a covered company could be subject to enforcement actions  growth limits  prohibitions on capital distributions and other consequences if a triggering event were to occur 
the federal reserve also indicates in the proposal that it intends to implement the basel iii capital surcharge framework  although the extent to which that would apply to the company is unclear 
under rules proposed by the occ in january  each of the banks and ing bank would be required to conduct semiannual stress tests 
in addition  in  the federal reserve finalized rules requiring the company to implement resolution planning for orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company often referred to as living wills 
the fdic has issued similar rules regarding resolution planning applicable to the banks and ing bank 
in addition to the provisions described throughout this supervision and regulation section  the dodd frank act imposes new  more stringent standards and requirements with respect to bank and nonbank acquisitions and mergers  affiliate transactions  and proprietary trading the volcker rule 
it is also possible that cona will be designated as a swap dealer under the dodd frank act due to its derivative activities associated with commercial lending  which would result in oversight by the commodity futures trading commission and more requirements for our current and future derivative transactions 
the dodd frank act also prohibits conflicts of interest relating to securitizations and generally requires securitizers to retain a economic interest in the credit risk of assets sold through the issuance of asset backed securitizations  with an exemption for traditionally underwritten residential mortgage loans 
in addition  the dodd frank act includes provisions related to corporate governance and executive compensation and new fees and assessments  among others 
the federal agencies have significant discretion in drafting the implementing rules and regulations of the dodd frank act 
these rules may result in modifications to our business models and organizational structure  and may subject us to escalating costs associated with any such changes 
however  the full impact of the dodd frank act will not be known for many months or  in some cases  years 
in addition  the dodd frank act requires various studies and reports to be delivered to congress  which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
basel ii us federal banking regulators finalized the advanced version of basel ii in december and they issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for the standardized version in june the rules are mandatory for those institutions with consolidated total assets of billion or more or consolidated total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more 
we expect to become subject to these rules at the end of as a result of the ing direct acquisition 

table of contents prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  organizations must complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters  known as the parallel run  during which they must meet the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of their primary us banking regulator 
based on current growth estimates  we would expect to enter parallel run january  this will require completing a written implementation plan and building processes and systems to comply with the rules 
compliance with the basel ii rules will require a material investment of resources 
the collins amendment within the dodd frank act and the us banking regulators implementing final rules establish a risk based capital floor so that organizations subject to basel ii rules may not hold less capital than would be required using basel i capital calculations 
our current analysis suggests that our risk weighted assets will increase under the basel ii framework  and therefore we would need to hold more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio 
we will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us 
basel iii in december  the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee released proposals for additional capital and liquidity requirements  which have been clarified and amended in recent pronouncements basel iii 
in september  the basel committee announced a package of reforms that included detailed capital ratios and capital conservation buffers  subject to transition periods through in december  the basel committee published a final framework on capital and liquidity  consistent in large part with the prior proposals 
the liquidity framework included two standards for liquidity risk supervision  each subject to observation periods and transitional arrangements 
one standard promotes short term resilience by requiring sufficient high quality liquid assets to survive a stress scenario lasting for days  the other promotes longer term resilience by requiring sufficient stable funding over a one year period  based on the liquidity characteristics of assets and activities 
how us banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear  particularly given the capital surcharge regulations that the federal reserve intends to implement under the dodd frank act and the current prompt corrective action framework 
us regulators have not yet implemented any portion of the basel iii framework  although we expect them to do so in the future 
we expect that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of basel iii  the dodd frank act and related activity 
we will continue to monitor regulators implementation of the new rules with respect to the institutions that are subject to them and assess the potential impact to us 
deposits and deposit insurance each of cona  cobna and ing bank  as an insured depository institution  is a member of the dif maintained by the fdic 
through the dif  the fdic insures the deposits of insured depository institutions up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the dif was formed on march   upon the merger of the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund in accordance with the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
the reform act permits the fdic to set a designated reserve ratio drr for the dif 
to maintain the dif  member institutions may be assessed an insurance premium  and the fdic may take action to increase insurance premiums if the drr falls below its required level 
prior to passage of the dodd frank act  the fdic had established a plan to restore the dif in the face of recent insurance losses and future loss projections  which resulted in several rules that generally increased deposit insurance rates and purported to improve risk differentiation so that riskier institutions bear a greater share of insurance premiums 
the dodd frank act reformed the management of the dif in several ways raised the minimum drr to from the former minimum of and removed the upper limit on the drr  required that the reserve ratio reach by september  rather than by the end of  required that in setting assessments  the fdic must offset the effect of meeting the increased reserve ratio on 
table of contents small insured depository institutions  and eliminated the requirement that the fdic pay dividends from the dif when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels 
the fdic has set the drr at and  in lieu of dividends  has established progressively lower assessment rate schedules as the reserve ratio meets certain trigger levels 
the dodd frank act also required the fdic to change the deposit insurance assessment base from deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
in february  the fdic finalized rules to implement this change that significantly modified how deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for those banks with assets of billion or greater 
banks may accept brokered deposits as part of their funding 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  as discussed in md a liquidity risk  only well capitalized and adequately capitalized institutions may accept brokered deposits 
adequately capitalized institutions  however  must first obtain a waiver from the fdic before accepting brokered deposits  and such deposits may not pay rates that significantly exceed the rates paid on deposits of similar maturity from the institution s normal market area or  for deposits from outside the institution s normal market area  the national rate on deposits of comparable maturity 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a bank s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the bank s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and its earnings 
overdraft protection the federal reserve amended regulation e in november to limit the ability to assess overdraft fees for paying atm and one time debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer s account  unless the consumer opts in to such payment of overdrafts 
the rule does not apply to overdraft services with respect to checks  ach transactions  or recurring debit card transactions  or to the payment of overdrafts pursuant to a line of credit or a service that transfers funds from another account 
we are required to provide to customers written notice describing our overdraft service  fees imposed and other information  and to provide customers with a reasonable opportunity to opt in to the service 
before we may assess fees for paying discretionary overdrafts  a customer must affirmatively opt in  which could negatively impact our deposit business revenue 
source of strength and liability for commonly controlled institutions under the regulations issued by the federal reserve  a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks the so called source of strength doctrine 
the dodd frank act codified the source of strength doctrine  directing the federal reserve to require bank holding companies to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks 
under the cross guarantee provision of the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea  insured depository institutions such as the banks and ing bank may be liable to the fdic with respect to any loss incurred  or reasonably anticipated to be incurred  by the fdic in connection with the default of  or fdic assistance to  any commonly controlled insured depository institution 
the banks and ing bank are commonly controlled within the meaning of the firrea cross guarantee provision 
fdic orderly liquidation authority the dodd frank act provided the fdic with liquidation authority that may be used to liquidate a financial company if the treasury secretary  in consultation with the president  based on the recommendation of the federal reserve and another federal agency  determines that doing so is necessary to mitigate serious adverse effects on us financial stability 
upon such a determination  the fdic would be appointed receiver and must 
table of contents liquidate the company in a way that mitigates significant risks to financial stability and minimizes moral hazard 
the costs of a liquidation of a financial company would be borne by shareholders and unsecured creditors and then  if necessary  by risk based assessments on large financial companies 
the fdic has issued rules implementing this authority  and may issue additional rules in the future 
ffiec account management guidance on january   the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec released account management and loss allowance guidance the guidance 
the guidance applies to all credit lending of regulated financial institutions and generally requires that banks properly manage several elements of their lending programs  including line assignments  over limit practices  minimum payment and negative amortization  workout and settlement programs  and the accounting methodology used for various assets and income items related to loans 
we believe that our account management and loss allowance practices are prudent and appropriate and  consistent with the guidance 
we caution  however  the guidance provides wide discretion to bank regulatory agencies in the application of the guidance to any particular institution and its account management and loss allowance practices 
accordingly  under the guidance  bank examiners could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices in the future  and such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
privacy and fair credit reporting the glba requires a financial institution to describe in a privacy notice certain of its privacy and data collection practices and requires that customers or consumers  before their nonpublic personal information is shared  be given a choice through an opt out notice to limit the sharing of such information about them with nonaffiliated third parties unless the sharing is required or permitted under the glba as implemented 
we  the banks and ing bank have written privacy notices that are available either through our website  the website of the relevant legal entity  or both  and are delivered to consumers and customers when required under the glba 
in accordance with the privacy notices  we  the banks and ing bank protect the security of information about our customers  educate our employees about the importance of protecting customer privacy and allow our customers to remove their names from the solicitation lists used and shared with others by us and the banks or ing bank to the extent they use or share such lists 
we  the banks and ing bank require business partners with whom we share such information to have adequate security safeguards and to abide by the redisclosure and reuse provisions of the glba 
to the extent that the glba and the fcra require us or one or more of the banks or ing bank to provide customers and consumers the opportunity to opt out of sharing information  then the relevant entity or entities provide such options in the privacy notice 
in addition to adopting federal requirements regarding privacy  the glba also permits individual states to enact stricter laws relating to the use of customer information 
to date  at least california and vermont have done so by statute  regulation or referendum  and other states may consider proposals which impose additional requirements or restrictions on us  the banks or ing bank 
if the federal or state regulators of the financial subsidiaries establish further guidelines for addressing customer privacy issues  we  one or more of the banks  or ing bank may need to amend our privacy policies and adapt our internal procedures 
under section b of the glba  among other sources of statutory authority  including state law  we are required to observe various data security related requirements  including establishing information security and data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions 
the failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject us to enforcement action or litigation 
like other financial institutions  the banks and ing bank rely upon consumer reports for prescreen marketing  underwriting new loans and for reviewing and managing risks associated with existing accounts 
in addition  the 
table of contents banks and ing bank furnish customer account information to the major consumer reporting agencies 
the use of consumer reports by the banks and ing bank and furnishing of account information to the consumer reporting agencies is regulated under the fcra on a uniform  nationwide basis 
this includes restrictions on the ability of the banks and ing bank to share consumer report information with affiliates and to use customer account information shared by affiliates for a marketing purpose 
the fair and accurate credit transactions act of the fact act  extends the federal preemption of the fcra permanently  although the law authorizes states to enact laws regulating certain subject matters so long as they are not inconsistent with the conduct required by the fcra 
the fact act also added new provisions to the fcra designed to address the growing crime of identity theft and to improve the accuracy of consumer credit information 
generally  fcra rulemaking and enforcement authority with respect to the banks and ing bank now resides with cfpb 
in addition  the fcra creates a limited private right of action for consumers to seek relief for certain violations for the fcra 
investment in the company  the banks and ing bank certain acquisitions of our capital stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal or state law 
investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not  directly or indirectly  acquire shares of our capital stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval 
each of the banks and ing bank is an insured depository institution within the meaning of the change in bank control act 
consequently  federal law and regulations prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without  in most cases  prior written approval of the federal reserve or the occ  as applicable 
control is conclusively presumed if  among other things  a person or company acquires more than of any class of our voting stock 
a rebuttable presumption of control arises if a person or company acquires more than of any class of voting stock and is subject to any of a number of specified control factors as set forth in the applicable regulations 
additionally  cobna and cona are banks within the meaning of chapter of title of the code of virginia governing the acquisition of interests in virginia financial institutions the financial institution holding company act 
the financial institution holding company act prohibits any person or entity from acquiring  or making any public offer to acquire  control of a virginia financial institution or its holding company without making application to  and receiving prior approval from  the virginia bureau of financial institutions 
because ing bank is a federal savings bank located in delaware  acquisitions of interests in ing bank are governed by chapter of title of the delaware code the delaware banking code 
the delaware banking code prohibits any person or entity from acquiring ownership or control of a federal savings bank located in delaware  or its holding company if its holding company is located in delaware  without making application to  and receiving prior approval from  the delaware state bank commissioner

cross border interchange fees are under scrutiny from the european commission ec and the oft 
the timing of any final resolution of the matter by the ec or the oft  which has suspended its own investigation into domestic interchange  is uncertain  but it is anticipated that the oft will await the outcome of the ec court decision before concluding its own investigation  currently expected to be spring if the ec decision is appealed to the european court of justice  we would expect the oft to continue the suspension 
an appeal to the european court of justice is unlikely to be decided before in january  the ec released a green paper that aims at identifying potential measures to create an integrated european market for card  internet and mobile payments 
the current scope of the paper is broad and includes issues such as market fragmentation  transparency and cost effective pricing of payment services  lack of standardization  interoperability between payment service providers  and security privacy concerns of payment service users 
the paper also looks at whether interchange arrangements create challenges for a fully integrated european market  which may increase the likelihood of further legislation in this area outside of the court process outlined above 
the ec will review comments from interested parties  which are due april  to decide next steps and what  if any  further regulation is required to create a single european market

the fcac guidance sets out the fcac commissioner s interpretation of the requirement under the credit business practices banks  authorized foreign banks  trust and loan companies  retail associations  canadian insurance companies and foreign insurance companies regulations to obtain express consent from a borrower prior to increasing the credit limit on a credit card 
the fcac s expectation is that credit card issuers obtain express consent from borrowers in each instance of a proposed credit limit increase by the issuer and that such consent is obtained at the time of the proposed credit limit increase 
the fcac guidance became effective in july in june  the bank act was amended to allow for certain information that is to be provided in writing  to be satisfied by the provision of an electronic document 
at the same time  the electronic documents banks and bank holding companies regulations  which prescribe additional requirements for the provision of electronic documents  became effective 
the additional requirements include obtaining customer consent to receive documents electronically and the provision of a notification to customers containing prescribed information 
the amendments specify that customers may revoke consent at any time  and confirmations of such revocation must be provided without delay 
the amendments also provide that if there is a reason to believe that a customer did not receive the electronic document  a paper document must be mailed 
in july  amendments to the financial consumer agency of canada act became effective  expanding the mandate of the fcac to include monitoring and evaluating trends and consumer issues that may have an impact on consumers of financial products and services 
in november  the fcac published a new compliance framework  which among other changes included amendments to the content  scope and frequency of existing reporting requirements and introduced a new requirement to self report certain compliance issues 
some of the new reporting requirements were effective immediately  while others will be effective on april  competition each of our business segments operates in a highly competitive environment  and we face competition in all aspects of our business from numerous bank and non bank providers of financial services 
our credit card business competes with international  national  regional and local issuers of visa and mastercard credit cards  as well as with american express  discover card and  to a certain extent  issuers of debit cards 
in general  customers are attracted to credit card issuers largely on the basis of price  credit limit and other product features  and customer loyalty is often limited 
our consumer banking and commercial banking businesses compete with national and state banks and direct banks for deposits  auto loans  mortgages and trust accounts and with savings and loan associations and credit unions for loans and deposits 
our competitors also include automotive finance companies  mortgage banking companies and other financial services providers that provide loans  deposits  and other similar services and products 
in addition  we compete against non depository institutions that are able to offer these products and services 
securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions 
combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business 
the financial services industry is also likely to become more 
table of contents competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
these technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties 
in addition  competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides our customers the ability to rapidly deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors 
our businesses generally compete on the basis of the quality and range of their products and services  transaction execution  innovation and price 
competition varies based on the types of clients  customers  industries and geographies served 
with respect to some of our products and geographies and products  we compete globally and with respect to others  we compete on a regional basis 
our ability to compete depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain our professional and other associates and on our reputation 
in the current environment  customers are generally attracted to depository institutions that are perceived as stable  with solid liquidity and funding 
we believe that we are able to compete effectively in our current markets 
there can be no assurance  however  that our ability to market products and services successfully or to obtain adequate returns on our products and services will not be impacted by the nature of the competition that now exists or may later develop  or by the broader economic environment 
for a discussion of the risks related to our competitive environment  please refer to item a 
risk factors 
employees a central part of our philosophy is to attract and retain a highly capable staff 
we had  employees  whom we refer to as associates  as of december  none of our associates are covered under a collective bargaining agreement  and management considers our employee relations to be satisfactory 
additional information geographic diversity our consumer loan portfolios  including credit cards  are diversified across the united states with modest concentration in california  texas  new york  florida  louisiana and illinois 
we also have credit card loans in the uk and canada 
our commercial loans are concentrated in new york  texas  louisiana and new jersey 
see md a credit risk profile and note significant concentration of credit risk for additional information 
technology systems we leverage information technology to achieve our business objectives and to develop and deliver products and services that satisfy our customers needs 
a key part of our strategic focus is the development of efficient  flexible computer and operational systems to support complex marketing and account management strategies  the servicing of our customers  and the development of new and diversified products 
we believe that the continued development and integration of these systems is an important part of our efforts to reduce costs  improve quality and provide faster  more flexible technology services 
consequently  we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems  processes and competencies to meet our unique business requirements 
as part of our continuous efforts to review and improve our technologies  we may either develop such capabilities internally or rely on third party outsourcers who have the ability to deliver technology that is of higher quality  lower cost  or both 
over time  we have increasingly relied on third party outsourcers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure 
these relationships include but are not limited to total system services inc tsys for processing services for our north american and united kingdom portfolios of consumer and small business credit card accounts  fidelity national information services fidelity for the capital one banking systems and ibm corporation for management of our north american data centers 

table of contents to protect our systems and technologies  we employ security  backup and recovery systems and generally require the same of our third party service providers 
in addition  we perform  or cause to be performed  a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms  systems and applications used to provide our products and services in an effort to ensure that any attacks on these platforms  systems and applications are unlikely to succeed 
to date  to our knowledge  we have not been targeted with a direct  material cyber attack 
we do not believe that the direct attacks we have seen have resulted in outside entities successfully penetrating our security controls 
intellectual property as part of our overall and ongoing strategy to protect and enhance our intellectual property  we rely on a variety of protections  including copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  patents and certain restrictions on disclosure  solicitation  and competition 
we also undertake other measures to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use certain intellectual property or proprietary information without authorization 
our precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information 
in addition  our competitors and other third parties also file patent applications for innovations that are used in our industry 
the ability of our competitors and other third parties to obtain such patents may adversely affect our ability to compete 
conversely  our ability to obtain such patents may increase our competitive advantage 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts  or that the ability of our competitors to obtain such patents may not adversely impact our financial results

table of contents other risk factors listed from time to time in reports that we file with the sec 
any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made or as of the date indicated  and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward looking statements as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
you should carefully consider the factors discussed above in evaluating these forward looking statements 
for additional information on factors that could materially influence forward looking statements included in this report  see the risk factors set forth under part i item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
item a 
risk factors business risks this section highlights specific risks that could affect our business 
although we have tried to discuss all material risks of which we are aware at the time this annual report on form k has been filed  other risks may prove to be important in the future  including those that are not currently ascertainable 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward looking statements include the current business environment  including a slow or delayed economic recovery  may adversely affect our industry  business  results of operations and capital levels 
the recent global recession resulted in a general tightening in the credit markets  lower levels of liquidity  reduced asset values including commercial properties  sharp and prolonged declines in residential home values and sales volumes  reduced business profits  increased rates of business and consumer repayment delinquency  increased rates of business and consumer bankruptcy  and increased and prolonged unemployment  some of which have had a negative impact on our results of operation 
although the overall economic recovery seems to be underway  it has remained modest and fragile 
a recovery that is only shallow and very gradual  marked by continued elevated unemployment rates and reduced home prices  or another downturn  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations as customers default on their loans or maintain lower deposit levels or  in the case of credit card accounts  carry lower balances and reduce credit card purchase activity 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events adverse macroeconomic conditions may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in addition  changes in consumer behavior  including decreased consumer spending and a shift in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fees  over limit fees  finance charges and other fees  could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
increases in bankruptcies could cause increases in our charge off rates  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged off may be limited  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the processes and models we use to estimate inherent losses may no longer be reliable because they rely on complex judgments  including assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation in an unpredictable economic environment  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers may be impaired if the criteria or models we use to underwrite and manage our customers become less predictive of future losses  which could cause our losses to rise and have a negative impact on our results of operations 

table of contents significant concern regarding the creditworthiness of some of the governments in europe has contributed to volatility in the financial markets and led to greater economic uncertainty worldwide 
sovereign debt concerns in europe could diminish economic recovery and lead to further stress in the financial markets  both globally and in the united states  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
our ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events  including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations  which could limit our access to funding 
the interest rates that we pay on our securities are also influenced by  among other things  applicable credit ratings from recognized rating agencies 
a downgrade to any of these credit ratings could affect our ability to access the capital markets  increase our borrowing costs and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
increased charge offs  rising libor and other events may cause our securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled  which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other sources 
we have increased our reliance on deposit funding over the past several years  in particular with the acquisition of ing direct  and an inability to accept or maintain deposits or to obtain other sources of funding could materially affect our liquidity position and our ability to fund our business 
many other financial institutions have also increased their reliance on deposit funding and  as such  we expect continued competition in the deposit markets 
we cannot predict how this competition will affect our costs 
if we are required to offer higher interest rates to attract or maintain deposits  our funding costs will be adversely impacted 
regulators  rating agencies or investors could change their standards regarding appropriate capital levels for banks in general or us in particular 
if the new standards call for capital levels higher than the capital we have or that we anticipate  it could have negative impacts on our ability to lend or to grow deposits and on our business results 
interest rates have remained at historically low levels for a prolonged period of time  and the flat yield curve associated with current interest rates generally leads to lower revenue and reduced margins because it limits our opportunity to increase the spread between asset yields and funding costs 
the continued presence of a flat yield curve for a sustained period of time could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and our net interest margin 
the historically low interest rate environment also increases our exposure to prepayment risk  particularly with respect to the originated mortgage portfolio we acquired from ing direct 
increased prepayments  refinancing or other factors would reduce expected revenue associated with mortgage assets and could also lead to a reduction in the value of our mortgage servicing rights  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
compliance with new and existing laws and regulations may increase our costs  reduce our revenue  limit our ability to pursue business opportunities  and increase compliance challenges 
there has been increased legislation and regulation with respect to the financial services industry in the last few years  and we expect that oversight of our business will continue to expand in scope and complexity 
a wide and increasing array of banking and consumer lending laws apply to almost every aspect of our business 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial  structural and operational penalties  including receivership  and could result in negative publicity or damage to our reputation with regulators or the public 
in addition  establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act  as well as the related rules and regulations adopted by various regulatory agencies  could have a significant adverse impact on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the dodd frank act is a comprehensive financial reform act that requires  among other things  enhanced prudential standards including capital and liquidity 
table of contents requirements  enhanced supervision including stress testing  recovery and resolution planning often referred to as living wills  prohibitions on proprietary trading and increased transparency and regulation of derivatives trading 
the dodd frank act also provides heightened expectations for risk management and regulatory oversight of all aspects of large financial institutions  including us 
many aspects of the law remain to be implemented under the rulemaking and regulatory authority of the sec  the cftc and federal banking regulators 
although it is clear that the dodd frank act will materially impact large financial institutions like us  the ultimate effect and scope of that impact may not be understood for years 
though some aspects of the dodd frank act will clearly have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations  other aspects of the law may not apply to us 
nevertheless  the law will increase our need to build new compliance processes and infrastructure and to otherwise enhance our risk management throughout all aspects of our business 
the cumulative impact will include higher expectations for capital and liquidity  as discussed in more detail below under the header we may not be able to maintain adequate capital levels or liquidity  which could have a negative impact on our financial results  and higher operational costs once regulators fully implement the law 
in addition  us government agencies charged with adopting rules and regulations under the dodd frank act may do so in an unforeseen manner  including ways that potentially expand the reach of the legislation more than as initially contemplated 
there are a number of other provisions in the dodd frank act that will impact our business  including the dodd frank act created a new independent supervisory body  the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb that became the primary regulator for federal consumer financial statutes on july  rule writing authority for specified consumer financial statutes transferred to cfpb from other federal regulators 
in addition  supervisory authority for consumer compliance over various institutions  including us  was transferred to the cfpb 
state attorneys general will be authorized to enforce new regulations issued by the cfpb 
although state consumer financial laws will continue to be preempted under the national bank act under the existing standard set forth in the supreme court decision in barnett bank of marion county  na v 
nelson  occ determinations of such preemption must be on a case by case basis  and courts reviewing the occ s preemption determinations will now consider the appropriateness of those determinations under a different standard of judicial review 
as a result  state consumer financial laws enacted in the future that might previously have been preempted may be held to apply to our business activities 
the cost of complying with these additional laws could have a negative impact on our financial results 
the dodd frank act requires that the amount of any interchange fee received by a debit card issuer with respect to debit card transactions be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction 
on june   the federal reserve adopted a final rule and an interim final rule implementing the portion of the dodd frank act that limits interchange fees received by a debit card issuer 
the final rule limits interchange fees per debit card transaction to 
plus five basis points of the transaction amount and provides  through the interim final rule  for an additional 
fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements 
these rules will negatively impact revenue from our debit card business 
under the dodd frank act  many trust preferred securities will cease to qualify for tier capital  subject to a three year phase out period expected to begin in also  the dodd frank act will most likely subject us to the supervision of regulatory agencies that historically have not regulated our businesses  such as the commodity futures trading commission with respect to our derivatives activities 
these provisions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition by increasing our cost of funding  our cost of capital or our cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations 
the credit card act amending the truth in lending act and related changes to regulation z impose a number of restrictions on credit card practices impacting rates and fees and also update the disclosures required for open end credit 
overlimit fees may not be imposed without prior consent of the customer  and the number of such fees that can be charged for the same violation is constrained 
the amount of any penalty fee or charge must be reasonable and proportional to the violation 
in addition  the ability of a card issuer to increase rates charged 
table of contents on pre existing card balances has been significantly restricted 
card issuers are generally prohibited from raising rates on pre existing balances when generally prevailing interest rates change 
moreover  the circumstances under which a card issuer can raise the interest rate on pre existing balances of a customer whose risk of default increases are restricted 
as a result  the rules implementing the credit card act could make the card business generally less resilient in future economic downturns 
under the various state and federal statutes and regulations  we are required to observe various data security and privacy related requirements  including establishing information security and data security breach response programs and properly authenticating customers before processing or enabling certain types of transactions or interactions 
future federal and state legislation and regulation could further restrict how we collect  use  share and secure customer information 
the failure to observe any one or more of these requirements could subject us to litigation or enforcement actions and impact some of our current or planned business initiatives 
certain laws and regulations  and any interpretations and applications with respect thereto  may benefit consumers  borrowers and depositors  but not stockholders 
the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control  may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue  costs  earnings  growth and capital levels 
our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations 
for a description of the laws and regulations to which we are subject  please refer to supervision and regulation in item business 
we may experience increased delinquencies and credit losses 
like other lenders  we face the risk that our customers will not repay their loans 
rising losses or leading indicators of rising losses such as higher delinquencies  higher rates of non performing loans  higher bankruptcy rates  lower collateral values or elevated unemployment rates may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses  which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce costs to compensate for higher losses 
in particular  we face the following risks in this area missed payments 
our customers may miss payments 
loan charge offs including from bankruptcies are generally preceded by missed payments or other indications of worsening financial condition for our customers 
customers are more likely to miss payments during an economic downturn or prolonged periods of slow economic growth 
in addition  we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change for example  an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customers to repay debt  causing a long term rise in delinquencies and charge offs 
estimates of inherent losses 
the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings 
we allow for and reserve against credit risks based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in our loan portfolios 
this process  which is critical to our financial results and condition  requires complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions 
we may underestimate our inherent losses and fail to hold a loan loss allowance sufficient to account for these losses 
incorrect assumptions could lead to material underestimates of inherent losses and inadequate allowance for loan and lease losses 
in addition  our estimate of inherent losses impacts the amount of allowances we build to account for those losses 
in cases where we modify a loan  if the modifications do not perform as anticipated we may be required to build additional allowance on these loans 
the increase or release of allowances impacts our current financial results 
underwriting 
our ability to assess the credit worthiness of our customers may diminish 
if the models and approaches we use to select  manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customers become less predictive of future charge offs due  for example  to rapid changes in the economy  including the unemployment rate  our credit losses may increase and our returns may deteriorate 
business mix 
our business mix could change in ways that could adversely affect credit losses 
we engage in a diverse mix of businesses with a broad range of credit loss characteristics 
consequently  changes in our business mix may change our charge off rate 

table of contents charge off recognition 
the rules governing charge off recognition could change 
we record charge offs according to accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules 
these guidelines and rules  including the ffiec account management guidance  could require changes in our account management or loss allowance practices and cause our charge offs to increase for reasons unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio 
such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
industry practices 
our charge off and delinquency rates may be negatively impacted by industry developments  including new regulations applicable to our industry 
collateral 
collateral  when we have it  could be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses 
when customers default on their loans and we have collateral  we attempt to seize it where permissible and appropriate 
however  the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan  and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customers 
particularly with respect to our commercial lending and home loan activities  decreases in real estate values adversely affect the value of property used as collateral for our loans and investments 
thus  the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate us for the value of these loans 
borrowers may be less likely to continue making payments on loans if the value of the property used as collateral for the loan is less than what the borrower owes  even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payments 
new york concentration 
although our lending is geographically diversified  approximately of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the new york metropolitan area 
the regional economic conditions in the new york area affect the demand for our commercial products and services as well as the ability of our customers to repay their commercial loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in the new york region could have a material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our results of operations 
we may experience increased losses associated with mortgage repurchases and indemnification obligations 
certain of our subsidiaries  including greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  capital one home loans and capital one  na  as successor to chevy chase bank  may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that have been sold to investors in the event there are certain breaches of certain representations and warranties contained within the sales agreements 
we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans that we sell to investors in the event that there was improper underwriting or fraud or in the event that the loans become delinquent shortly after they are originated 
these subsidiaries also may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur in the event of breaches of representations and warranties and in various other circumstances  including securities fraud claims  and the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
consequently  we may be exposed to credit risk associated with sold loans 
we have established reserves in our consolidated financial statements for potential losses that are considered to be both probable and reasonably estimable related to the mortgage loans sold by our originating subsidiaries 
the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred will depend on  among other things  the actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests  the actual success rate of claimants  developments in litigation related to us and the industry  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
due to uncertainties relating to these factors  there can be no assurance that our reserves will be adequate or that the total amount of losses incurred will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
for additional information related to our mortgage loan repurchase and indemnification obligations and related reserves and our estimate of the upper end of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels as of december   see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees 

table of contents we may not be able to maintain adequate capital levels or liquidity  which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
as a result of the dodd frank act and international accords  financial institutions will become subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirements 
although it is not yet clear what form these requirements will take or how they will apply to us  it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital levels above the levels in our current financial plans 
these new requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend  grow deposit balances or make acquisitions and on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases 
higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity 
recent developments in capital and liquidity requirements that may impact us include the following in december  the basel committee on banking supervision published a final framework commonly known as basel iii on capital and liquidity 
the key elements of the capital proposal include raising the quality  consistency and transparency of the capital base  strengthening the risk coverage of the capital framework  introducing a leverage ratio that is different from the us leverage ratio measures  promoting the build up of capital buffers  and imposing a capital surcharge for global systemically important institutions 
the liquidity framework includes two standards for liquidity risk supervision  one standard promoting short term resilience and the other promoting longer term resilience 
how us banking regulations will be modified to reflect these international standards remains unclear  particularly given the forthcoming capital and other prudential requirement regulations under the dodd frank act and the current prompt corrective action framework 
we expect  however  that minimum capital and liquidity requirements for us and other institutions will increase as a result of basel iii  the dodd frank act and related activity 
in november  the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar 
under the rules  bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions 
the purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress 
as part of its evaluation of a capital plan  the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan  the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters 
because we are a consolidated bank holding company with consolidated assets of billion or greater  we are subject to certain heightened prudential standards under the dodd frank act  including requirements that may be recommended by the financial stability oversight council and implemented by the federal reserve 
as a result  we expect to be subject to more stringent standards and requirements than those applicable for smaller institutions  including risk based capital requirements  leverage limits and liquidity requirements 
in december  the federal reserve released proposed rules beginning to implement the enhanced prudential requirements  including a detailed liquidity framework 
if finalized as proposed  these requirements would increase our liquidity requirements and associated compliance and operational costs 
the basel ii final rules as implemented in the united states are mandatory for those institutions with consolidated total assets of billion or more or consolidated total on balance sheet foreign exposure of billion or more 
we expect to become subject to these rules at the end of as a result of the acquisition of ing direct 
prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  organizations must complete a qualification period of four consecutive quarters  known as the parallel run  during which they must meet the requirements of the rule to the satisfaction of their primary us banking regulator 
based on current growth estimates  we would expect to enter parallel run january  this will require 
table of contents completing a written implementation plan and building processes and systems to comply with the rules 
compliance with the basel ii rules will require a material investment of resources 
in addition  our current analysis suggests that our risk weighted assets will increase under the basel ii framework  and therefore we would need to hold more regulatory capital in order to maintain a given capital ratio 
see item business supervision and regulation for additional information 
we face risk related to our operational  technological and organizational infrastructure 
our ability to grow and compete is dependent on our ability to build or acquire necessary operational  technological and organizational infrastructure 
we are in the process of completing significant development projects to complete the systems integration of prior acquisitions and to build a scalable infrastructure in both our retail banking and commercial banking businesses 
we anticipate making additional infrastructure changes and upgrades in connection with the integration of ing direct and the pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business 
our pending acquisition of the hsbc us credit card business in particular involves the transfer of intellectual property  servicing platforms  infrastructure  contact centers and a significant number of employees 
we expect that decoupling and transitioning these assets  infrastructure and systems from hsbc s current systems and operations and integrating them into our own business operations will be a highly complex process 
these infrastructure changes  upgrades and integrations may cause disruptions to our existing and acquired businesses  including  but not limited to  systems interruptions  transaction processing errors  interruptions to collection processes and system conversion delays  all of which could have a negative impact on us 
in addition  we expect to enter into numerous transitional service arrangements with hsbc entities that will provide for services associated with the decoupling and transition of the business 
under these arrangements  hsbc will provide certain services to us and we will provide certain services to hsbc 
these transitional service arrangements will continue for various dates until the separation of the business from hsbc is complete  and during that time we will rely on the ability of the applicable hsbc entities to provide these services 
the complexities and requirements of these arrangements will increase the operational risk associated with the transition and integration of the business  and this increased risk could lead to unanticipated expenses  disruptions to our operations or other adverse consequences 
while we expect the pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business will close in the second quarter of  the complexities of the decoupling and transition could present risks of delay to our anticipated closing timing 
any significant delay in closing the acquisition could have a negative impact on our results of operations due to increased costs or a delay in our realization of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
similar to other large corporations  we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest itself in many ways  such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes  faulty or disabled computer systems  fraud by employees or persons outside of our company and exposure to external events 
in addition  we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems which we use to manage our internal financial and other systems  interface with our customers and develop and implement effective marketing campaigns 
our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones and to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on the functionality and reliability of our operational and technology systems 
any disruptions or failures of our operational and technology systems  including those associated with improvements or modifications to such systems  could cause us to be unable to market and manage our products and services or to report our financial results in a timely and accurate manner  all of which could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
in some cases  we and the businesses we are acquiring outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality to third parties 
these third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control 
any increase in the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to third parties may increase our exposure to these risks 

table of contents in addition  our on going investments in infrastructure  which may be necessary to maintain a competitive business  integrate newly acquired businesses such as ing direct and hsbc s us credit card business and establish scalable operations  may increase our expenses 
further  as our business develops  changes or expands  additional expenses can arise as a result of a reevaluation of business strategies  management of outsourced services  asset purchases or other acquisitions  structural reorganization  compliance with new laws or regulations or the integration of newly acquired businesses 
if we are unable to successfully manage our expenses  our financial results will be negatively affected 
we could incur increased costs or reductions in revenue or suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft  loss or misuse of information  including as a result of a cyber attack 
our products and services involve the gathering  storage and transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers and their accounts 
our ability to provide such products and services  many of which are web based  relies upon the management and safeguarding of information  software  methodologies and business secrets 
to provide these products and services  we use information systems and infrastructure that we and third party service providers operate 
we also have arrangements in place with retail partners and other third parties where we share and receive information about their customers who are or may become our customers 
as a financial institution  we also are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection laws  regulations and guidance  as well as to our own internal privacy and information security policies and programs 
if unauthorized persons were somehow to get access to personal  confidential or proprietary information  including customer information  in our possession or to our proprietary information  software  methodologies and business secrets  it could result in significant legal and financial exposure  supervisory liability  damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems  products and services that could adversely affect our business 
information security risks for large financial institutions like us have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies  the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime  perpetrators of fraud  hackers  terrorists  activists and other external parties 
as noted above  our operations rely on the secure processing  transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks 
our businesses rely on our digital technologies  computer and email systems  software and networks to conduct their operations 
in addition  to access our products and services  our customers may use computers  personal smartphones  tablet pc s and other mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems 
although we believe we have a robust suite of authentication and layered information security controls  our technologies  systems  networks and our customers devices may become the target of cyber attacks or other attacks that could result in the unauthorized release  gathering  monitoring  misuse  loss or destruction of our or our customers confidential  proprietary or other information  including their access credential to accounts with online functionality  or that could result in disruptions to the business operations of us or our customers or other third parties 
further  a breach or attack affecting one of our third party service providers or partners could impact us through no fault of our own 
because the methods and techniques employed by perpetrators of fraud and others to attack  disable  degrade or sabotage platforms  systems and applications change frequently and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have been launched  we and our third party service providers and partners may be unable to anticipate certain attack methods in order to implement effective preventative measures 
should a cyber attack against us succeed on any material scale  market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed  and we could face the aforementioned risks 
though we have insurance against some cyber risks and attacks  it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event 
the growth of our online banking business presents certain risks 
as a result of our strategic decisions and recent acquisitions  including ing direct  we have grown our online banking business significantly over the past few years 
today  we operate one of the largest online banking 
table of contents businesses in the world  with over billion in deposits as of december  while online banking represents a significant opportunity for customers in terms of greater and more flexible access to banking services at reduced costs  it also presents significant risks 
in addition to the software  infrastructure and cyber attack risks discussed above  we face risks related to online banking  including we face strong competition in the online banking market 
aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balances and the cost efficient acquisition of new deposit funds and may affect our growth and profitability 
when general economic conditions improve  new competitors may forcefully enter the market and pursue a discount pricing strategy in order to attract loan origination volume  particularly if the new entrants target high quality loans 
in addition  the effects of a competitive environment may be exacerbated by the flexibility of online banking and the increasing financial and technological sophistication of our customer base 
customers could close their online accounts or reduce balances or deposits in favor of products and services offered by competitors 
these shifts  which could be rapid  could result from general dissatisfaction with our products or services  including concerns over pricing  online security or our reputation 
for example  once we transition from the ing direct brand for the online banking business we recently acquired  the new brand may not be as readily accepted by customers as we anticipate  and these customers may not accept our branding  image  name  reputation  policies or level of service or may be dissatisfied with perceived differences regarding how they manage their online accounts after the transition  and as a result may transfer their accounts and business to a competitor 
our online businesses are dependent on our ability to process  record and monitor a large number of complex transactions 
if any of our financial  accounting  or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings  we could be materially adversely affected 
third parties with which we do business could also be sources of operational risk  particularly in the event of breakdowns or failures of such parties own systems 
any of these occurrences could diminish our ability to operate one or more of our online banking businesses  or result in potential liability to clients  reputational damage and regulatory intervention  any of which could result in a material adverse effect 
we may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  which may include  for example  computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages  cyber attacks  as discussed above  natural disasters  other damage to property or physical assets or events arising from local or larger scale politics  including terrorist acts 
such disruptions may give rise to losses in service to customers and loss or liability to us 
we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our mergers and acquisitions  which failure could result in adverse effects on our results of operations or dilution of our common stockholders 
we have engaged in merger and acquisition activity over the past several years and may continue to engage in such activity in the future 
we have explored  and expect to continue to explore  opportunities to acquire financial services companies and financial assets and to enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy 
for example  as described under recent acquisition and disposition activity ing direct  we announced the ing direct acquisition in june and the acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business in august in addition  we entered into credit card partnership agreements with  kohl s corp  sony corporation and hudson s bay company during the past two years  including the acquisition of the related credit card loan portfolios  and we acquired chevy chase bank in february we continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in  among other merger and acquisition activity  additional strategic partnerships and selected acquisitions of financial institutions and other financial assets  including credit card and other loan portfolios 
any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake will entail certain risks  which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
if we experience greater than anticipated costs to integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  including cost savings and other synergies  our business could be negatively affected 
in addition  it is possible that the ongoing integration processes could result in the loss of key 
table of contents employees  errors or delays in systems implementation  the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients  customers  depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership 
integration efforts also may divert management attention and resources 
these integration matters may have an adverse effect on us during any transition period 
in addition  we may face the following risks in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  including the ing direct acquisition and the pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card businesses new businesses and geographic or other markets 
our merger  acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new businesses and new geographic areas or other markets which present risks resulting from our relative inexperience in these new businesses or markets 
these new businesses or markets may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of businesses and could react differently to economic and other external factors 
we face the risk that we will not be successful in these new businesses or in these new markets 
identification and assessment of merger and acquisition targets and deployment of acquired assets 
we cannot assure you that we will identify or acquire suitable financial assets or institutions to supplement our organic growth through acquisitions or strategic partnerships 
in addition  we may incorrectly assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we acquire 
further  our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to assess the asset quality and value of the particular assets or institutions we partner with  merge with or acquire 
we may be unable to profitably deploy any assets we acquire 
regulatory approval 
any future and pending merger or acquisition may be subject to regulatory or governmental approvals  which will require  among other things  review of our resulting financial condition  our ability to manage our resulting size  competitive considerations and our service to the community 
we cannot assure you that we will receive any regulatory or governmental approvals 
if such regulatory approvals of a merger or acquisition are not granted or are granted with conditions that become applicable to the parties  delayed or failed implementation of our strategic objectives could result  including failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger or acquisition 
in addition  governmental authorities from which approvals are typically required frequently have broad discretion in administering governing regulations 
these governmental authorities may impose requirements  limitations or costs  or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our or another party s business after the completion of merger or acquisition transaction 
dilutive issuances 
we may issue common stock  other equity securities or debt in connection with future mergers and acquisitions  including in public offerings to fund such mergers and acquisitions or to provide adequate capital for the additional assets acquired 
issuances of our common stock  other equity securities or debt  whether as consideration for such mergers or acquisitions or to raise necessary funds or capital  may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and our common stockholders equity 
accuracy of assumptions 
in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  we may make certain assumptions relating to the proposed merger or acquisition that may be  or may prove to be  inaccurate  including as the result of the failure to realize the expected benefits of any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership 
the inaccuracy of any assumptions we may make could result in unanticipated consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
assumptions we might make when considering a proposed merger  acquisition or strategic partnership may relate to numerous matters  including projections of a target or partner company s future net income and our earnings per share  our ability to issue equity and debt to complete any merger or acquisition  our expected capital structure and capital ratios after any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  projections as to the amount of future loan losses in any target or partner company s portfolio  
table of contents the amount of goodwill and intangibles that will result from any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  certain purchase accounting adjustments that we expect will be recorded in our financial statements in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  cost  deposit  cross selling and balance sheet synergies in connection with any merger  acquisition or strategic partnership  merger  acquisition or strategic partnership costs  including restructuring charges and transaction costs  our ability to maintain  develop and deepen relationships with customers of a target or partner company  our ability to grow a target or partner company s customer deposits and manage a target or partner company s assets and liabilities  higher than expected transaction and integration costs and unknown liabilities as well as general economic and business conditions that adversely affect the combined company following any merger or acquisition transaction  the extent and nature of regulatory oversight over a target or partner company  projected or expected tax benefits or assets  accounting matters related to the target or partner company  including accuracy of assumptions and estimates used in preparation of financial statements such as those used to determine allowance for loan losses  fair value of certain assets and liabilities  securities impairment and realization of deferred tax assets  our expectations regarding macroeconomic conditions  including the unemployment rate  housing prices  the interest rate environment  the shape of the yield curve  inflation and other economic indicators  and other financial and strategic risks associated with any merger or acquisition 
target specific risk 
assets and companies that we acquire will have their own risks that are specific to a particular asset or company 
these risks include  but are not limited to  particular or specific regulatory  accounting  operational  reputational and industry risks  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
indemnification rights  if any  may be insufficient to compensate us for any losses or damages resulting from such risks 
in addition to regulatory approvals discussed above  certain of our merger  acquisitions or partnership activity may require third party consents in order for us to fully realize the anticipated benefits of any such transaction 
termination fees 
termination of agreements relating to the acquisition of an entity or assets  or merger with another entity  may  under certain circumstances  result in termination fees that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
reputational risk and social factors may impact our results 
our ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon the perceptions of consumer and commercial borrowers and deposit holders and other external perceptions of our business practices or our financial health 
adverse perceptions regarding our reputation in the consumer  commercial and funding markets could lead to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them 
in particular  negative perceptions regarding our reputation could lead to decreases in the levels of deposits that consumer and commercial customers and potential customers choose to maintain with us 
negative public opinion could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances  including lending practices  regulatory compliance  inadequate protection of customer information  or sales and marketing  and from actions taken by regulators or other persons in response to such conduct 

table of contents in addition  a variety of social factors may cause changes in borrowing activity  including credit card use  payment patterns and the rate of defaults by accountholders and borrowers domestically and internationally 
these social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels  the public s perception regarding consumer debt  including credit card use  and changing attitudes about the stigma of bankruptcy 
if consumers develop or maintain negative attitudes about incurring debt  or if consumption trends decline  our business and financial results will be negatively affected 
damage to our brands could impact our financial performance 
our brands have historically been very important to us 
as with many financial services institutions  maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and to continue to provide high quality products and services 
negative public perception of our brands could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance  regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information  as well as from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to that conduct 
if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands  or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our online banking brands may also be negatively impacted by a number of factors  including service outages  product malfunctions  data privacy  lack of training  security issues and integration difficulties from recent acquisitions 
we face intense competition in all of our markets 
we operate in a highly competitive environment  and we expect competitive conditions to continue to intensify 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
we compete on the basis of the rates we pay on deposits and the rates and other terms we charge on the loans we originate or purchase  as well as the quality of our customer service 
price competition for loans might result in origination of fewer loans or earning less on our loans 
we expect that competition will continue to increase with respect to most of our products 
some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are  which may give those competitors advantages  including a more diversified product and customer base  the ability to reach out to more customers and potential customers  operational efficiencies  more versatile technology platforms  broad based local distribution capabilities  lower cost funding and larger existing branch networks 
in addition  some of our competitors are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject  which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we have recently expanded our partnership business with the addition of kohl s  hudson s bay company and sony  and we expect to add a significant number of partnerships with the pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business 
the market for key business partners  especially in the card business  is very competitive  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships 
we face the risk that we could lose partner relationships  even after we have invested significant resources  time and expense in acquiring and developing the relationships 
the loss of any of our business partners could have a negative impact on our results of operations  including lower returns  excess operating expense and excess funding capacity 
in such a competitive environment  we may lose entire accounts or may lose account balances to competing firms  or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base 
customer attrition from any or all of our lending products  together with any lowering of interest rates or fees that we might implement to retain customers  could reduce our revenues and therefore our earnings 
similarly  customer attrition from our deposit products  in addition to an increase in rates or services that we may offer to retain those deposits  may increase our expenses and therefore reduce our earnings 

table of contents if we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry  our financial performance may suffer 
our ability to deliver to stockholders strong financial performance and returns on investment will depend in part on our ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of our customers 
with our recent acquisition of ing direct and our pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business  we expect to market new products to our growing customer base 
our ability to sell more products to customers is a key part of our strategy to grow revenue and earnings 
many of our competitors are also focusing on cross selling  which could limit our ability to execute our cross sell strategy or require lower interest rates or fees on our lending products or offer higher interest rates on deposits  as well as affect our ability to maintain existing customers 
this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers 
fluctuations in market interest rates or volatility in the capital markets could adversely affect our revenue and expense  the value of assets and obligations  our cost of capital or our liquidity 
like other financial institutions  our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the capital markets 
changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us 
for example  we borrow money from other institutions and depositors  which we use to make loans to customers and invest in debt securities and other earning assets 
we earn interest on these loans and assets and pay interest on the money we borrow from institutions and depositors 
fluctuations in interest rates  including changes in the relationship between short term rates and long term rates and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate  may have negative impacts on our net interest income and therefore our earnings 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations and competitor responses to those changes may affect the rate of customer prepayments for mortgage  auto and other term loans and may affect the balances customers carry on their credit cards 
these changes can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio 
changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts they have with us 
in addition  changes in valuations in the debt and equity markets could have a negative impact on the assets we hold in our investment portfolio 
finally  such market changes could also have a negative impact on the valuation of assets for which we provide servicing 
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on assumptions about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate changes 
we take risk mitigation actions based on those assessments 
we face the risk that changes in interest rates could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than those we assumed 
see md a market risk management for additional information 
our business could be negatively affected if it is unable to attract  retain and motivate skilled senior leaders 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to retain key senior leaders  and competition for such senior leaders can be intense in most areas of our business 
the executive compensation provisions of the dodd frank act and the regulations issued thereunder  and any further legislation  regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation  may limit the types of compensation arrangements that we may enter into with our most senior leaders and could have a negative impact on our ability to attract  retain and motivate such leaders in support of our long term strategy 
these laws and regulations may not apply in the same manner to all financial institutions  and we therefore may face more restrictions than other institutions and companies with whom we compete for talent 
if we are unable to retain talented senior leadership  our business could be negatively affected 

table of contents our businesses are subject to the risk of increased litigation 
our businesses are subject to increased litigation risks as a result of a number of factors and from various sources  including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry  the focus of state and federal prosecutors on banks and the financial services industry  the structure of the credit card industry and business practices in the mortgage lending business 
substantial legal liability against us could have a material adverse effect or cause significant reputational harm to us  which could seriously harm our business 
for a description of the litigation risks that we face  see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees 
we face risks from unpredictable catastrophic events 
despite our substantial business contingency plans  the impact from natural disasters and other catastrophic events  including terrorist attacks  may have a negative effect on our business and infrastructure  including our information technology systems 
the impact of such events and other catastrophes on the overall economy may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks from the use of estimates in our financial statements 
pursuant to united states generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing our financial statements  including  but not limited to  estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
if the assumptions or estimates underlying our financial statements are incorrect  we may experience unexpected material losses 
for a discussion of our use of estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  see note summary of significant accounting policies 
our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends 
we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries 
dividends to us from our direct and indirect subsidiaries  including our bank subsidiaries  have represented a major source of funds for us to pay dividends on our common stock  make payments on corporate debt securities and meet other obligations 
there are various federal law limitations on the extent to which the banks can finance or otherwise supply funds to us through dividends and loans 
these limitations include minimum regulatory capital requirements  federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits or surplus  sections a and b of the federal reserve act and regulation w governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  as well as general federal regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
if our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels  our liquidity may be affected and we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common stockholders  to make payments on outstanding corporate debt securities or meet other obligations  each and any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial position or perception of financial health 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the stability and actions of other financial services institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  servicing  counterparty and other relationships 
with our recent acquisition of ing direct and our pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card businesses  we have exposure to increasing numbers of financial institutions and counterparties 
these counterparties include institutions and counterparties that may be exposed to various risks over which we have little or no control  including european or us sovereign debt that is currently or may become in the future subject to significant price pressure  rating agency downgrade or default risk 

table of contents in addition  we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients  resulting in a significant credit concentration with respect to the financial services industry overall 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
likewise  adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of our competitors  the financial services industry as a whole and the general economic climate or sovereign debt could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments 
in addition  adverse developments with respect to third parties with whom we have important relationships also could negatively impact perceptions about us 
these perceptions about us could cause our business to be negatively affected and exacerbate the other risks that we face

table of contents item selected financial data we prepare our consolidated financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap  which we refer to as our reported results 
below we present selected consolidated financial data from our reported results of operations for the five year period ended december   as well as selected consolidated balance sheet data as of the end of each year within this five year period 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
the historical financial information presented may not be indicative of our future performance 
prior to january   we also presented and analyzed our results on a non gaap managed basis 
our managed presentation assumed that securitized loans accounted for as sales and reported as off balance sheet in accordance with applicable accounting guidance in effect prior to january   remained on balance sheet  and the earnings from the loans underlying these trusts are reported in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings from loans that we own 
while our managed presentation resulted in differences in the classification of revenues in our income statement  net income on a managed basis was the same as reported net income 
effective january   we prospectively adopted two new accounting standards related to the transfer and servicing of financial assets and consolidations that changed how we account for our securitization trusts 
the adoption of these new accounting standards  which we refer to in this report as new consolidation accounting standards  resulted in the consolidation of substantially all of our securitization trusts

introduction we are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non banking subsidiaries that offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers  small businesses and commercial clients through branches  the internet and other distribution channels 
we continue to deliver on our strategy of combining the power of national scale lending and local scale banking 
we had billion in total loans outstanding and billion in deposits as of december   compared with billion in total loans outstanding and billion in deposits as of december  our revenues are primarily driven by lending to consumers and commercial customers and by deposit taking activities  which generate net interest income  and by activities that generate non interest income  such as fee based services provided to customers  merchant interchange fees with respect to certain credit card transactions  gains and losses and fees associated with the sale and servicing of loans 
our expenses primarily consist of the cost of funding our assets  our provision for loan and lease losses  operating expenses including associate salaries and benefits  infrastructure maintenance and enhancements and branch operations and expansion costs  marketing expenses and income taxes 
we expect expenses associated with the integration of the ing direct and the pending acquisition of the hsbc us credit card business to represent a significant portion of our expenses in our principal operations are currently organized  for management reporting purposes  into three primary business segments  which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking 
the operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments 
certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in our other category 
credit card consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending  national small business lending  national closed end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in canada and the united kingdom 
consumer banking consists of our branch based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses  national deposit gathering  national auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities 
commercial banking consists of our lending  deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and middle market customers 
our middle market customers typically include commercial and industrial companies with annual revenues between million to billion 
table summarizes our business segment results  which we report based on income from continuing operations  net of tax  for  and we provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our consolidated results using us gaap in note business segments of this report

table of contents executive summary and business outlook we continued to operate in an environment of elevated economic and regulatory uncertainty during the overall economic recovery remained modest and fragile 
the unemployment rate remained persistently high and the housing market continued to struggle  due in part to the large backlog of homes in the foreclosure process and high rate of delinquent loans 
the ongoing and expected development of new regulations and regulatory organizations resulting from the dodd frank act contributed to continued regulatory uncertainty 
despite the challenges presented by these conditions  we experienced loan growth and stabilization in credit performance during financial highlights we reported net income of billion per diluted share in  with each of our three business segments contributing to our earnings 
in comparison  we reported net income of billion per diluted share in our capital levels continued to increase during  with total stockholders equity up billion from year end our tier risk based capital ratio under basel i was as of december   up basis points from december   and our tier common equity ratio  a non gaap measure  was as of december   up basis points from the prior year period  reflecting strong internal capital generation as well as the continued decline in the amount of disallowed deferred tax assets 
our stockholders equity and capital ratios as of december  do not reflect any impact from the equity forward sale agreements executed in july referenced below  as they had not been settled in whole or in part as of that date 
we present the calculation of our regulatory capital ratios and a reconciliation of our supplemental non gaap capital measures below under md a supplemental tables 
in  we acquired hbc s existing billion credit card loan portfolio and kohl s existing billion private label credit card loan portfolio 
in june  we entered into a definitive agreement with the ing sellers to acquire ing direct and closed the acquisition on february  in addition  in august we entered into a purchase agreement with hsbc to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume liabilities of hsbc s credit card and private label credit card business in the united states for an estimated cash premium of billion as of june  we provide additional information on the ing direct and hsbc acquisitions below 
we took several actions during the year to manage the anticipated impact of the ing direct acquisition on our market risk exposure and regulatory capital requirements 
from the date we entered into the agreement to acquire ing direct to early august  interest rates declined substantially  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the ing direct net assets and liabilities 
in order to capture some of the anticipated benefits to regulatory capital on the closing date attributable to this decline in interest rates  in early august  we entered into various interest rate swap transactions with a total notional principal amount of approximately billion 
we subsequently rebalanced the hedge in october adding an additional billion in notional principal for a total combined notional principal amount of approximately billion 
these combined swap transactions were intended to mitigate the effect of a rise in interest rates on the fair values of a significant portion of the ing direct assets and liabilities during the period from when we entered into the swap transactions to the anticipated closing date of the ing direct acquisition in early although the interest rate swaps represented economic hedges  they were not designated for hedge accounting under us gaap 
therefore  we recorded changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in earnings 
in  we recorded a mark to market loss of million related to these interest rate swaps  which was attributable to the decline in interest rates 
this million loss was largely offset by a gain of million related to the sale of approximately billion of investment securities  consisting predominantly of agency mortgage backed securities mbs 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ing direct on february   we terminated the billion in interest rate swaps related to the acquisition 
at termination  the fair value of the swaps was a net loss of million 
based on current estimates  we believe the interest rate swaps related to the acquisition were effective in meeting our hedging objective 
for additional information  see market risk profile and note derivative instruments and hedging activities 

table of contents below are additional highlights of our performance for these highlights generally are based on a comparison between our and results 
the changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of december   compared with our financial condition and credit performance as of december  we provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this executive summary and business outlook 
total company earnings our earnings of billion in increased by million  or  from the increase in net income was primarily attributable to significantly lower credit costs due to improvements in loan credit quality 
the increase in net income for also reflected a substantial reduction in the provision for mortgage repurchase losses for legacy mortgage related representation and warranty claims 
these factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily due to continued investment in growing our businesses  accelerating the building of our infrastructure and increased marketing expenditures 
total loans period end loans held for investment increased by billion  or  in  to billion as of december   from billion as of december  the increase was primarily attributable to growth in our credit card  commercial banking  and auto finance businesses  which included the additions of the billion hbc credit card loan portfolio in the first quarter of and the billion kohl s private label credit card loan portfolio in the second quarter of excluding the impact of the additions of the hbc and kohl s credit card loan portfolios  total loans increased by billion  or  in  due to strong purchase volume growth across the domestic card business  a significant increase in auto loan originations and steady loan growth in our commercial banking business 
the impact from these factors was partially offset by the continued expected run off of installment loans in our credit card business and legacy home loans in our consumer banking business  other loan paydowns and charge offs 
charge off and delinquency statistics our net charge off rate declined by basis points to in  from in the day delinquency rate also declined during the year to as of december   from as of december  the improvement in overall credit trends reflected the impact from strong underlying credit performance and tighter underwriting standards 
allowance for loan and lease losses we reduced our allowance by billion in to billion as of december  in comparison  after taking into consideration the allowance build resulting from the january  adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards  we reduced our allowance by billion in the significant reduction in the allowance release in from the allowance release in reflected the impact of stabilizing credit trends in while our net charge off rate improved by basis points in from  the allowance coverage ratio decreased by only basis points to as of december   from as of december  representation and warranty reserve our representation and warranty reserve totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  this reserve  which relates to our mortgage loan repurchase exposure for legacy mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to various parties under contractual provisions that include various representations and warranties  reflects losses as of each balance sheet date that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable 
we recorded a provision for this exposure of million in  compared with a provision of million in business segments credit card our credit card business generated net income from continuing operations of billion in  the same level as net income from continuing operations in our credit card business results for 
table of contents reflected the benefit from improved credit performance  which resulted in a significant decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses 
the provision decrease  however  was offset by an increase in non interest expense attributable to increased operating and integration costs related to the acquisitions of the credit card loan portfolios of sony  hbc and kohl s and increased marketing expenditures 
new account originations have continued to grow in our credit card business  due in part to these acquisitions 
consumer banking our consumer banking business generated net income from continuing operations of million in  compared with net income from continuing operations of million in the decrease in net income for reflected the impact of the absence of a one time pre tax gain of million recorded in the first quarter of from the deconsolidation of certain option adjustable rate mortgage trusts and an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses primarily attributable to growth in auto loans 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in total revenue resulting from a shift in our loan product mix toward higher priced auto loans  coupled with lower cost deposit growth through our retail banking branches 
strong growth in auto loan originations during more than offset a continued run off in legacy home loans 
commercial banking our commercial banking business generated net income from continuing operations of million in  compared with net income from continuing operations of million in the improvement in results for our commercial banking business reflected an increase in revenues  a modest decrease in non interest expense and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses due to the improvement in credit quality 
as a result of the improvement in credit quality  we reduced the allowance for loan and lease losses for our commercial banking business by million during to million as of december  we continued to experience steady loan and deposit growth in our commercial banking business 
business environment and significant recent developments recent business and regulatory developments the challenging economic environment continued through due to concerns about the us debt ceiling and subsequent downgrade of the us debt  the continued elevated us unemployment rate and the european debt crisis 
these concerns resulted in increased economic uncertainty and market volatility 
we believe actions we took in underwriting and managing our business through the recession  including focusing on our most resilient businesses  have continued to drive our strong credit performance 
as a result  we believe our internal portfolio credit metrics remain strong  and expect normal seasonality to re emerge after a long period of cyclical improvement in we provide more information on recent regulatory developments in supervision and regulation in item business of this report 
acquisition related developments ing direct we completed the acquisition of ing direct on february  the aggregate consideration paid was  shares of common stock and approximately billion in cash 
the ing direct acquisition consists of assets  which include cash and cash equivalents  investment securities and loans with a total estimated fair value of billion as of december  and deposits of approximately billion as of december  equity and debt offerings on july   we closed a public offering of four different series of our senior notes  for total proceeds of approximately billion 
the offering of senior notes included million aggregate principal amount of our floating rate senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due 
table of contents on february   we settled forward sale agreements that we entered into with certain counterparties acting as forward purchasers in connection with a public offering of shares of our common stock on july  pursuant to the forward sale agreements  we issued million shares of our common stock 
after underwriter s discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company were at a forward sale price per share of for a total of approximately billion 
we used the net proceeds of these offerings  along with cash sourced from current liquidity  to fund the billion in cash consideration paid in connection with the ing direct acquisition 
hsbc acquisition us credit card business in august  we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume liabilities of hsbc s credit card and private label credit card business in the united states for a premium estimated at billion as of june  we currently expect the hsbc acquisition to close in the second quarter of  subject to customary closing conditions  including certain governmental clearances and approvals 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we have the option  subject to certain conditions  to pay up to million of the consideration to hsbc in the form of our common stock valued at per share 
business outlook we discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near term based on market conditions  the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this annual report on form k 
the statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies 
our expectations take into account  and should be read in conjunction with  our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in item business and md a of this report 
certain statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from those in our forward looking statements 
forward looking statements do not reflect i any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies  ii the effect of any acquisitions  divestitures or similar transactions  except for the forward looking statements specifically discussing the ing direct acquisition or the pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business  or iii any changes in laws  regulations or regulatory interpretations  in each case after the date as of which such statements are made 
see forward looking statements in item business of this report for factors that could materially influence our results 
total company expectations our strategies and actions are designed to deliver profitable long term growth through the acquisition and retention of franchise enhancing customer relationships across our businesses 
we believe that franchise enhancing customer relationships produce strong long term economics through low credit costs  low customer attrition and a gradual build in loan balances and revenues over time 
examples of franchise enhancing customer relationships include rewards customers and new partnerships in our credit card business  long term retail deposit customers in our consumer banking business and primary banking relationships with commercial customers in our commercial banking business 
we intend to grow these customer relationships by continuing to invest in our bank infrastructure to allow us to provide more convenient and flexible customer banking options  including a broader range of fee based and credit products and services  by leveraging our direct bank customer franchise with national reach and by continued marketing investments to further strengthen our brand 
we believe our actions have created a well positioned balance sheet and capital and liquidity levels which have provided us with investment flexibility to take advantage of attractive opportunities and adjust  where we believe appropriate  to changing market conditions 
our existing loan portfolio returned to growth in the second half of  reflecting seasonal consumer spending trends and increasing balances in our private label partnerships 
we expect loan balances to increase in with the addition of the ing direct and hsbc loan portfolios 
the timing and pace of expected loan growth  excluding growth from acquired loans  will depend on broader economic trends that impact overall consumer and commercial demand 

table of contents the growth in non interest expenses in the  which was more pronounced in the fourth quarter of  was primarily due to the continued investment in growing our businesses and building our infrastructure 
in  we expect that operating expenses will increase significantly as a result of integration and direct operating costs associated with the acquisition of ing direct and the pending acquisition of hsbc s us credit card business 
we believe our marketing investments in were in equilibrium with current market opportunities 
we expect that any changes in marketing expenditures in would be driven by changes in the level and attractiveness of market opportunities 
as noted above  we closed the acquisition of ing direct in the first quarter of and expect to close the acquisition of the us credit card business of hsbc in the second quarter of we expect these acquisitions will have a material impact on our reported results of operations and financial condition 
while we continue to expect that the combined acquisitions will deliver compelling financial performance and strategic benefit in and beyond  we anticipate a potentially significant negative impact from the acquisitions to our earnings per share 
the expected negative impact will result from  among other things  the impact to common shares outstanding resulting from our settlement of the equity forward sale agreements and the issuance of common stock to the ing sellers in the first quarter of as well as an additional planned equity issuance of approximately billion discussed below under capital management pending hsbc us credit card business acquisition  integration and other merger related expenses  purchase accounting impacts and provision for loan losses as we build allowance for acquired current revolving credit accounts 
purchase accounting impacts include  for example  amortization of acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles  purchased credit card relationships and contract intangibles and the amortization of fair value marks 
business segment expectations credit card business in domestic card  we returned to modest growth with expected seasonal patterns in the second half of new account growth is a leading indicator of future growth in loans and revenues as spending and balances build on these accounts over time 
because of the strong growth trends in purchase volumes and new accounts  we expect that our domestic card business will continue to post strong returns in  with modest underlying growth reflecting seasonal patterns 
we expect to add significant new customer relationships and loan portfolios with the acquisition of the hsbc us credit card business  which we expect to close in the second quarter of after this initial increase in loan volumes  the hsbc us credit card business acquisition may diminish our domestic card growth trajectory due to the expected run off of portions of the hsbc credit card portfolio 
consumer banking business in our consumer banking business  we expect the strong trajectory in loans and revenues will continue in our auto finance business in we also believe we have reached a cyclical low point for auto finance charge offs  and that seasonal patterns will drive quarterly credit trends in our retail banking business added significant new customer relationships  loans and deposits with the acquisition of ing direct  and we expect the acquisition will have a significant impact on consumer banking loan and deposit growth trajectories 
we expect that the growth in auto loans will be more than offset by a sizeable run off of the ing direct home loan portfolio and the continuing run off of our legacy home loan portfolio  which will drive a declining trend in consumer banking loan volumes 
commercial banking business our commercial banking business continues to grow loans  deposits  and revenues as we attract new customers and deepen relationships with existing customers 
commercial banking credit metrics improved and stabilized in although we anticipate some quarterly fluctuations in nonperforming loan and charge off rates  we expect our commercial banking business to continue the strong and steady performance trends it delivered throughout 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make a number of judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements 
we provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in note summary of significant accounting policies 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition 
these critical accounting policies govern loan loss reserves representation and warranty reserve asset impairment fair value derivative and hedge accounting income taxes we evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions 
management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed these policies with the audit and risk committee of the board of directors 
loan loss reserves we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that represents management s estimate of incurred credit losses inherent in our held for investment loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we maintain a separate reserve for the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees on credit card loans 
allowance for loan and lease losses we have an established process  using analytical tools  benchmarks and management judgment  to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we calculate the allowance for loan and lease losses by estimating incurred losses for segments of our loan portfolio with similar risk characteristics 
the allowance totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  we generally review and assess our allowance methodologies and adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis 
our assessment involves evaluating many factors including  but not limited to  historical loss and recovery experience  recent trends in delinquencies and charge offs  risk ratings  the impact of bankruptcy filings  the value of collateral underlying secured loans  account seasoning  changes in our credit evaluation  underwriting and collection management policies  seasonality  general economic conditions  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance for loan and lease losses 
key factors that have a significant impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses include assumptions about unemployment rates  home prices  and the valuation of commercial properties  consumer real estate  and autos 
although we examine a variety of externally available data  as well as our internal loan performance data  to determine our allowance for loan and lease losses  our estimation process is subject to risks and uncertainties  including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance 
accordingly  our actual credit loss experience may not be in line with our expectations 
for example  as a result of improving credit performance trends during and  charge offs 
table of contents began to decrease and we recorded significant allowance releases of billion in and billion in we provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments in note summary of significant accounting policies 
we provide information on the components of our allowance  disaggregated by impairment methodology  and changes in our allowance in note allowance for loan and lease losses 
finance charge and fee reserve we recognize finance charges and fees on credit card loans as revenue when the amounts are billed to the customer and include these amounts in the loan balance  net of the estimated uncollectible amount of finance charges and fees 
we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off  however  when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue 
revenue was reduced by million  million and billion in  and  respectively  for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees 
the finance charge and fee reserve totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables 
accordingly  the estimation process is subject to similar risks and uncertainties  including a reliance on historical loss and trend information that may not be representative of current conditions and indicative of future performance 
changes in key assumptions may have a material impact on the amount of billed finance charges and fees we estimate as uncollectible in each period 
we determine the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis  primarily based on the use of a roll rate methodology 
we refine our estimation process and key assumptions used in determining our loss reserves as additional information becomes available 
in the third quarter of  we revised the manner in which we estimate expected recoveries of finance charge and fee amounts previously considered to be uncollectible 
our revised recovery assumptions better reflect the post recession pattern of relatively low delinquency roll rates combined with increased recoveries of finance charges and fees previously considered uncollectible 
this change in assumptions resulted in reduction in our uncollectible finance charge and fee reserves of approximately million as of september   and in a corresponding increase in revenues 
we also applied these revised assumptions to the estimated recovery of principal charge offs in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses 
the revision  however  had an insignificant impact on the overall determination of our allowance for lease and loan losses 
representation and warranty reserve in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  certain subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan  indemnify the investor or insurer  or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors  depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 

table of contents during  we made significant refinements to our process for estimating our representation and warranty reserve  due primarily to increased counterparty activity and our ability to extend the timeframe  in most instances  over which we estimate the repurchase liability for mortgage loans sold by our subsidiaries to gses and those mortgage loans placed into active insured securitizations to the full life of the mortgage loans 
prior to the second quarter of  we generally estimated the amount of probable repurchase requests to be received over the next months 
as a result of these refinements  we recorded a substantial increase in our representation and warranty repurchase reserve in the first and second quarters of approximately million of the provision for representation and warranty reserves of million recorded in resulted from the extension of our repurchase liability estimates to the full life of the loan effective in the second quarter of the remaining million related primarily to changing counterparty activity in the form of updated estimates around active and probable litigation  most of which occurred in the first quarter of our aggregate representation and warranty mortgage repurchase reserves  which we report as a component of other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million as of december   compared with million as of december  the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by us or one of our subsidiaries will depend on  among other things  actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests  the actual success rates of claimants  developments in litigation  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
see consolidated balance sheet analysis potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities below and note commitments  contingencies and guarantees for additional information 
asset impairment we review other assets for impairment on a regular basis 
this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimates and assumptions 
our investment securities and goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our other assets 
accordingly  below we describe our process for assessing impairment of these assets and the key estimates and assumptions involved in this process 
investment securities we regularly review investment securities for other than temporary impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criteria 
if we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell a security before its anticipated recovery  the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings 
if we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost  we evaluate other qualitative criteria to determine whether a credit loss exists 
our evaluation requires significant management judgment and a consideration of many factors  including  but not limited to  the extent and duration of the impairment  the health of and specific prospects for the issuer  including whether the issuer has failed to make scheduled interest or principal payments  recent events specific to the issuer and or industry to which the issuer belongs  the payment structure of the security  external credit ratings  the value of underlying collateral and current market conditions 
quantitative criteria include assessing whether there has been an adverse change in expected future cash flows 
for equity securities  our evaluation criteria include the length of time and magnitude of the amount that each security is in an unrealized loss position

goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of our acquisitions  principally hibernia corporation in  north fork bancorporation in  and chevy chase bank in  we have goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally 
table of contents determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
we had goodwill of billion recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 
other intangible assets consist primarily of core deposit intangibles 
other intangible assets  which we report on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets  totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
goodwill and other intangible assets together represented of our total assets as of december  and goodwill is not amortized but must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment on an annual basis or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment 
a reporting unit is a business segment or one level below 
our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing are domestic card  international card  auto finance  other consumer banking and commercial banking 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test for all reporting units as of october each year using a two step process 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its current carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value  the related goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no further analysis is necessary 
if  however  the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and a second step of testing is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any  for that reporting unit 
estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets  liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments  particularly related to cash flows  the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium 
management judgment is required to assess whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit 
there are widely accepted valuation methodologies  such as the market approach earnings multiples and or transaction multiples and or discounted cash flow methods  that are used to estimate the fair value of reporting units 
in applying these methodologies  we utilize a number of factors  including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections  and market data 
we also may engage an independent valuation specialist to assist in our valuation process 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the goodwill impairment analyses  fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions 
in some instances  minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount 
furthermore  a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying amount 
also  to the extent step two of the goodwill analyses is required  changes in the estimated fair values of individual assets and liabilities may impact other estimates of fair value for assets or liabilities and result in a different amount of implied goodwill  and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
in conducting our goodwill impairment test for  we determined the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis  a form of the income approach 
our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth  revenue growth  credit losses  and capital rates 
we relied on each reporting unit s internal cash flow forecast and calculated a terminal value using a growth rate that reflected the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units 
we adjusted cash flows as necessary to maintain each reporting unit s equity capital requirements 
the cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that were largely based on our external cost of equity  adjusted for risks inherent in each reporting unit 
we corroborated the key inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis with market data  where available  to validate that our assumptions were within a reasonable range of observable market data 
based on the results of step one of our goodwill impairment test  we determined that the fair value of each of our reporting units  including goodwill  significantly exceeded the carrying value for each reporting unit 
fair value as a percentage of carrying value for our five reporting units ranged from to  with the 
table of contents international reporting unit being at the low end of this range 
as such  none of our reporting units was at risk of failing step one of the impairment test 
accordingly  the goodwill for each of our reporting units was considered not impaired 
therefore  the second step of impairment testing was not required 
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test  we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry 
continued market volatility and uncertainty regarding overall economic conditions have led to a decline in market capitalization in recent years resulting in significantly higher control premiums than what had been seen historically 
we will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in  overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their estimated lives and evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset s or asset group s carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment loss  generally calculated as the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of an asset or asset group  is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value 
we did not recognize impairment on our other intangible assets in  or we provide additional information on the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  including the process and methodology used to conduct goodwill impairment testing  in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted prices in active markets or observable market parameters 
when quoted prices and observable data in active markets are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
changes in market conditions  such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities  may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine fair value 
we have developed policies and procedures to determine when markets for our financial assets and liabilities are inactive if the level and volume of activity has declined significantly relative to normal conditions 
if markets are determined to be inactive  it may be appropriate to adjust price quotes received 
when significant adjustments are required to price quotes or inputs  it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable inputs 

table of contents significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instruments measured at fair value are included in level or level in making this determination  we consider all available information that market participants use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs used 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
our financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis represented approximately of our total reported assets of billion as of december   compared with of our total reported assets of billion as of december  financial assets for which the fair value was determined using significant level inputs represented approximately of these financial instruments less than of total assets as of december  and we discuss changes in the valuation inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our financial instruments  including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable inputs to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these inputs  in note fair value of financial instruments 
key controls over fair value measurement we have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable 
our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties 
our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types  price verification and review of valuation judgments  methods  models  process controls and results 
groups independent from our trading and investing functions  including our valuations group and valuations advisory committee  participate in the review and validation process 
the valuation advisory committee includes senior representation from business areas  our enterprise risk oversight division and our finance division 
our valuations group performs monthly independent verification of fair value measurements by comparing the methodology driven price to other market source data to the extent available  and uses independent analytics to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable 
for example  in cases where we rely on third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures  we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the pricing used by comparing the information to additional sources  including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources 
the valuations advisory committee regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we primarily use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate risk  and to a lesser extent  foreign currency risk 
our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free standing derivatives 
free standing derivatives consist of customer accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that we enter into for risk management purposes that are not linked to specific assets or liabilities or to forecasted transactions and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges or net investment hedges 
although all derivative financial instruments  whether designated for hedge accounting or not  are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets  the accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments differs based on whether the derivative has been designated as a qualifying accounting hedge and the type of accounting hedge 

table of contents to obtain and maintain hedge accounting  we must be able to establish at hedge inception and throughout the hedge term that the hedging instrument is highly effective at offsetting exposures to the hedged risk attributable to the hedged item both retrospectively and prospectively and ensure documentation meets stringent requirements 
we apply critical and complex judgment regarding the data and values used in assessing hedge effectiveness and in interpreting the results of tests performed to assess hedge effectiveness especially when the regression analysis method is used 
without hedge accounting  we may experience significant volatility in our earnings as we would be required to recognize all changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments in earnings 
we provide detail on derivatives gains and losses recognized in our earnings in  and and amounts related to cash flow hedges recorded in aoci as of december  and in note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
income taxes our annual provision for income tax expense is based on our income  statutory tax rates and other provisions of tax law applicable to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions  including evaluating uncertainties 
we review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available 
our income tax expense consists of two components current and deferred taxes 
our current income tax expense approximates taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period 
it also includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions and revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes resulting from the resolution of income tax controversies 
our deferred income tax expense results from changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management s judgment that realization is more likely than not 
we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income from all sources  including taxable income in carryback years  reversal of taxable temporary differences  forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies 
these sources of income rely heavily on estimates 
we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecasts to provide insight 
at december   we have recorded deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities and valuation allowances  of approximately billion  a decrease of million from billion at december  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to fully realize the net deferred tax asset amounts at the end of if changes in circumstances lead us to change our judgment about our ability to realize deferred tax assets in future years  we will adjust our valuation allowances in the period that our change in judgment occurs and record a corresponding increase or charge to income 
we provide additional information on income taxes in consolidated results of operations and in note income taxes 
consolidated results of operations as indicated above under item selected financial data  our reported results prior to january  are not presented on a basis consistent with our reported results subsequent to january  as a result of our adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards 
our reported results subsequent to january  are more comparable to our managed results because we assumed for our managed based reporting that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in

accordingly  the section below provides a comparative discussion between our reported results of operations for and and between our reported results of operations for and our managed results for our net income on a managed basis for is the same as our reported net income  however  there are differences in the classification of certain amounts in our managed income statement  which we identify in our discussion 
see md a supplemental tables for a reconciliation of our non gaap managed based information for periods prior to january  to the most comparable reported us gaap information 
net interest income net interest income represents the difference between the interest income and applicable fees earned on our interest earning assets  which include loans held for investment and investment securities  and the interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities  which include interest bearing deposits  senior and subordinated notes  securitized debt and other borrowings 
we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem are collectible 
our net interest margin represents the difference between the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  including the impact of non interest bearing funding 
prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on january   our reported net interest income did not include interest income from loans in our off balance sheet securitization trusts or the interest expense on third party debt issued by these securitization trusts 
beginning january   servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to consolidated securitization trusts are included in net interest income

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
our net interest income of billion for increased by million  or  from  driven by a basis points expansion in our net interest margin to  which was partially offset by a modest decrease in average interest earning assets 
net interest margin the increase in our net interest margin in reflected the benefit from the improvement in our cost of funds  as we shifted the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and 
table of contents commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources and the decline in deposit interest rates as a result of the overall interest rate environment 
the decrease in yield on interest earning assets was attributable to the addition of the kohl s portfolio 
under our partnership agreement with kohl s  we share a fixed percentage of revenues  consisting of finance charges and late fees 
we report revenues related to kohl s credit card loans on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements  which has the effect of reducing the yield on our average interest earning assets 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by the run off of lower margin installment loans  a reduced level of new accounts with low introductory promotional rates  and an increase in the recognition of billed finance charges and fees due to the improvement in credit performance as well as the change we made in the third quarter of in our estimation of non principal recoveries used in determining our uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve 
average interest earning assets the decrease in average interest earning assets in reflected the continued run off of businesses that we exited or repositioned  including our installment  home loan and small ticket commercial real estate loan portfolios  which were slightly offset by the impact of modest revolving credit card loan growth and the addition of the existing hbc credit card loan portfolio of billion in the first quarter of and the addition of the existing kohl s private label credit card loan portfolio of billion in the second quarter of our reported net interest income of billion in increased by million  or  from managed net interest income of billion in driven by a basis points expansion in of our net interest margin to  which was partially offset by a decrease in average interest earning assets 
net interest margin the increase in net interest margin in was primarily attributable to a significant reduction in our average cost of funds  coupled with an increase in the average yield on interest earning assets 
our cost of funds continued to benefit from the shift in the mix of our funding to lower cost consumer and commercial banking deposits from higher cost wholesale sources 
also  the overall interest rate environment  combined with our disciplined pricing  drove a decrease in our average deposit interest rates 
the increase in the average yield on our interest earning assets during reflected the benefit of pricing changes that we implemented during  which contributed to an increase in the average yield on our loan portfolio  as well as improved credit conditions  which has allowed us to recognize a greater proportion of previously reserved uncollected finance charges into income 
average interest earning assets the decrease in average interest earning assets resulted from the run off of loans in businesses that we exited or repositioned  elevated charge offs and weak consumer demand 
non interest income non interest income primarily consists of service charges and other customer related fees  interchange income net of rewards expense and other non interest income 
the servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net of charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our consolidated securitization trusts are reported as a component of non interest income 
prior to the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards on january   our reported non interest income included servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our securitization trusts as a component of non interest income 
in addition  when we created securitization trusts  we recognized gains or losses on the transfer of loans to these trusts and recorded our initial retained interests in the trusts 
effective january   unless we qualify for sale accounting under the new consolidation accounting standards  we no longer recognize a gain or loss or record retained interests when we transfer loans into securitization trusts 
the servicing fees  finance charges  other fees  net of charge offs and interest paid to third party investors related to our consolidated securitization trusts are now reported as a component of net interest income instead of as a component of non interest income

non interest income of billion in decreased by million  or  from non interest income of billion in this decrease was attributable to the absence of a one time pre tax gain of million recorded in the first quarter of and net gains on the sale of securities in  and the impact of contra revenue amounts recorded in the second and fourth quarters of  including a provision of million for anticipated refunds to uk customers related to retrospective regulatory requirements pertaining to payment protection insurance ppi in our uk business 
the decrease was partially offset by increased customer fees related to treasury management and public financing activities  and the decrease in the provision for mortgage loan repurchases 
non interest income of billion in decreased by billion  or  from managed non interest income of billion in this decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in over limit fees as a result of provisions under the card act  a decline in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights due to the run off of our legacy home loan portfolio and an increase in the provision for mortgage loan repurchases 
provision for loan and lease losses we build our allowance for loan and lease losses through the provision for loan and lease losses 
our provision for loan and lease losses in each period is driven by charge offs and the level of allowance for loan and lease losses that we determine is necessary to provide for probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we recorded a reported provision for loan and lease losses of billion in  compared with billion in and billion in the managed provision for loan and lease losses totaled billion in 
table of contents the decrease in the provision in and was largely driven by a substantial decline in net charge offs across all of our business segments  reflecting the improvement in the credit performance of our loan portfolio

the increase in the average yield on our credit card loan portfolio reflected the benefit of pricing changes that were implemented during and a reduction in the level of loans with low introductory promotional rates 
net interest income also reflected the benefit of the recognition into income of an increased amount of previously suppressed billed finance charges and fees as a result of improving credit trends 
non interest income non interest income decreased by billion  or  in the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in penalty fees resulting from the implementation of provisions of the card act and a reduction in customer accounts 

table of contents provision for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses related to our credit card business decreased by billion in  to billion 
the substantial reduction in the provision was driven by improved credit trends  as evidenced by a reduction in the net charge off rate and a decrease and stabilization of delinquency rates throughout the year  as well as lower period end loan balances

potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities in recent years  we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers  including purchasers who created securitization trusts 
these subsidiaries are capital one home loans  which was acquired in february  greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  which was acquired in december as part of the north fork acquisition  and chevy chase bank  which was acquired in february and subsequently merged into cona 
in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with 
table of contents applicable federal  state and local laws 
the representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans  but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty 
each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties 
in the event of a repurchase  the subsidiary is typically required to pay the then unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses including  in certain cases  legal costs incurred by the purchaser and or others 
the subsidiary then recovers the loan or  if the loan has been foreclosed  the underlying collateral 
the subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral 
in some instances  rather than repurchase the loans  a subsidiary may agree to make a cash payment to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims 
in addition  our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties 
in some cases  the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
these subsidiaries  in total  originated and sold to non affiliates approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between and  which are the years or vintages with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims 
table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations  by vintage for through for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the outstanding principal balance as of december  and table unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to third parties based on category of purchaser unpaid principal balance december  original unpaid principal balance dollars in billions total government sponsored enterprises gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total gses include fannie mae and freddie mac 
between and  our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the gses 
of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance insured securitizations  approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries active insured securitizations  and the remaining approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries inactive insured securitizations 
insured securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors 
bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers  and they often have super majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors 

table of contents because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others  we do not have complete information about the current ownership of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to gses or placed in insured securitizations 
we have determined based on information obtained from third party databases that about billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans are currently held by private label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance uninsured securitizations 
in contrast with the bond insurers in insured securitizations  investors in uninsured securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can direct a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases  including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes 
an additional approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans 
of this amount  we believe approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were ultimately purchased by gses 
for purposes of our reserves setting process  we consider these loans to be private label loans rather than gse loans 
various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in this category 
with respect to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between and  we estimate that approximately billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of december   approximately billion in losses have been realized and approximately billion in unpaid principal balance is at least days delinquent 
because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others  we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans 
these amounts reflect our best estimates  including extrapolations where necessary 
these extrapolations occur on the approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans for which we do not have complete information about the current holders or the underlying credit performance 
these estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis 
the subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of december   compared with billion as of december  as of december   the majority of new repurchase demands received over the last year and  as discussed below  the majority of our million reserve relates to the billion of original principal balance of mortgage loans originally sold to the gses or to active insured securitizations 
currently  repurchase demands predominantly relate to the and vintages 
we have received relatively few repurchase demands from the and vintages  mostly because greenpoint ceased originating mortgages in august the following table presents information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request 
the amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances 
table open pipeline all vintages all entities dollars in millions all amounts are original principal balance gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total open claims as of december  gross new demands received loans repurchased made whole demands rescinded open claims as of december  gross new demands received loans repurchased made whole demands rescinded reclassifications open claims as of december  
table of contents the open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses 
accordingly  repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline 
moreover  repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue repurchase requests are included within the open pipeline unless the requesting party has formally rescinded its repurchase request 
finally  the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans 
activity in relates to repurchase demands from all years 
represents adjustments to correct the counterparty category as of december  for amounts that were misclassified 
the reclassification had no impact on the total pending repurchase requests  however  it resulted in an increase in open claims attributable to gses and insured securitizations and a decrease in open claims attributable to uninsured securitizations and other 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
these reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for repurchase losses  which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non interest income for loans originated and sold by chevy chase bank and capital one home loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser 
in establishing reserves for the billion original principal balance of gse loans  we rely on the historical relationship between gse loan losses and repurchase outcomes to estimate the percentage of current and future gse loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the gses over the lifetime of the gse loans  and the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases 
we also rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on gse loans 
this reserving approach to the gse loans reflects the historical interaction with the gses around repurchase requests  and also includes anticipated repurchases resulting from mortgage insurance rescissions 
the gses typically have stronger contractual rights than non gse counterparties because gse contracts typically do not contain prompt notice requirements for repurchase requests or materiality qualifications to the representations and warranties 
moreover  although we often disagree with the gses about the validity of their repurchase requests  we have established a negotiation pattern whereby the gses and our subsidiaries continually negotiate around individual repurchase requests  leading to the gses rescinding some repurchase requests and our subsidiaries agreeing in some cases to repurchase some loans or make the gses whole with respect to losses 
our lifetime representation and warranty reserves with respect to gse loans are grounded in this history 
for the billion original principal balance in active insured securitizations  our reserving approach also reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests 
typically  monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the active insured securitization category 
in response to these repurchase requests  our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements around a valid repurchase request have been satisfied 
in response to these requests for supporting documentation  monoline bond insurers typically initiate litigation 
accordingly  our reserves within the active insured securitization are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers  but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers 
every bond insurer within this category is pursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation 
accordingly  our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves 
in establishing litigation reserves for this category  we consider 
table of contents current and future losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization 
our estimated legal liability for each securitization within this category assumes that we will be responsible for only a portion of the losses inherent in each securitization 
our litigation reserves with respect to both the us bank litigation and the dbsp litigation  in each case as referenced below  are contained within the active insured securitization reserve category 
further  our litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third party securitizations sponsors  where greenpoint provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation  are also contained within this category 
for the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the inactive insured securitizations category and the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the uninsured securitizations and other whole loan sales categories  we establish reserves by relying on our historical activity and repurchase rates to estimate repurchase liabilities over the next twelve months 
we do not believe we can estimate repurchase liability for these categories for a period longer than twelve months because of the relatively irregular nature of repurchase activity within these categories 
some uninsured securitization investors from this category who have not made repurchase requests or filed representation and warranty lawsuits are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and or state securities laws 
although we face some direct and indirect indemnity risks from these litigations  we have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities 
the aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries were million as of december   as compared with million as of december  we recorded a total provision for repurchase losses for our representation and warranty repurchase exposure of million for the year ended december   primarily driven by increased repurchase activity from uninsured securitizations and other whole loan investors 
during  we had settlements of repurchase requests totaling million that were charged against the reserve 
the table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves for the years ended december  and the following table summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve for the full years of and table changes in representation and warranty reserve year ended december  dollars in millions representation and warranty repurchase reserve  beginning of period provision for repurchase losses net realized losses representation and warranty repurchase reserve  end of period reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities

the pre tax portion of the provision for mortgage repurchase claims recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations totaled million and million in and  respectively 
as indicated in the table below  most of the reserves relate to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly to the gses and to the billion in mortgage loans sold to purchasers who placed them into active insured securitizations 

table of contents table allocation of representation and warranty reserves reserve liability december  loans sold to dollars in millions  except for loans sold gses and active insured securitizations inactive insured securitizations and others total reflects  in billions  the total original principal balance of mortgage loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third party investors between and the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries will depend on  among other things  actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests including the extent  if any  to which inactive insured securitizations and other currently inactive investors ultimately assert claims  the actual success rates of claimants  developments in litigation  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
as part of our business planning processes  we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes that would justify an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards 
we believe that the upper end of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels  including reasonably possible future losses relating to the us bank litigation  dbsp litigation and the fhlb of boston litigation  could be as high as billion  the same level as we provided as of september  and an increase of million from the estimate we provided as of december  this increase is attributable to increased activity from uninsured investors  increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny of mortgage practices and continued difficulty in the housing market and overall economy 
notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of loss beyond our current accrual levels based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimated upper end of the amount of reasonably possible losses 
there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels  including  but not limited to  litigation outcomes  future repurchase claims levels  ultimate repurchase success rates and mortgage loan performance levels 
off balance sheet arrangements and variable interest entities in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies  partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities vies 
some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements  depending on the nature or structure of  and accounting required to be applied to  the arrangement 
these arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets 
our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms  including securitization and servicing activities  the purchase or sale of mortgage backed or other asset backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to vies that hold debt  equity  real estate or other assets 
under previous accounting guidance  we were not required to consolidate the majority of our securitization trusts because they were qualified special purpose entities qspes 
accordingly  we considered these trusts to be off balance sheet arrangements 
effective january   we prospectively adopted two new accounting standards related to the transfer and servicing of financial assets and consolidations that changed how we account 
table of contents for our securitization trusts 
the adoption of these new consolidation accounting standards resulted in the consolidation of substantially all of our securitization trusts 
our continuing involvement in unconsolidated vies primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of these unconsolidated vies was billion and million  respectively  as of december   and our maximum exposure to loss was billion 
we provide a discussion of our activities related to these vies in note variable interest entities and securitizations 
capital management the level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors  including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and an internal risk based capital assessment  and may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines  subsidiary capital requirements  the business environment  conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments 
capital standards and prompt corrective action bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the federal reserve and the occ  respectively 
the capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of their assets and off balance sheet items 
under the capital adequacy standards  bank holding companies and banks currently are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a tier leverage capital ratio of at least for banks that meet certain specified criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and the highest regulatory rating in order to be considered adequately capitalized 
national banks also are subject to prompt corrective action capital regulations 
under prompt corrective action regulations  a bank is considered to be well capitalized if it maintains a tier risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a total risk based capital ratio of at least basis points higher than the above minimum capital standard  a tier leverage capital ratio of at least and is not subject to any supervisory agreement  order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital reserve 
a bank is considered to be adequately capitalized if it meets these minimum capital ratios and does not otherwise meet the well capitalized definition 
currently  prompt corrective action capital requirements do not apply to bank holding companies 
in addition to disclosing our regulatory capital ratios  we also disclose tier common equity and tce ratios  which are non gaap measures widely used by investors  analysts  rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies 
there is currently no mandated minimum or well capitalized standard for tier common equity  instead the risk based capital rules state that voting common stockholders equity should be the dominant element within tier common equity 
while these non gaap capital measures are widely used by investors  analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies  they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we provide information on the calculation of these ratios and non gaap reconciliation in supplemental tables below 
table provides a comparison of our capital ratios under the federal reserve s capital adequacy standards  and the capital ratios of the banks under the occ s capital adequacy standards as of december  and table provides the details of the calculation of our capital ratios

under regulatory guidelines for risk based capital  on balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of any collateral 
the aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are aggregated for determining total risk weighted assets 
in november  the federal reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us commonly referred to as comprehensive capital analysis and review or ccar 
under the rules  bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more must submit capital plans to the federal reserve on an annual basis and must obtain approval from the federal reserve before making most capital distributions 
the purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust  forward looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress 
as part of its evaluation of a capital plan  the federal reserve will consider the comprehensiveness of the plan  the reasonableness of assumptions and analysis and methodologies used to assess capital adequacy and the ability of the bank holding company to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a tier common ratio of on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout a planning horizon of at least nine quarters 
the january  adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in our consolidating a substantial portion of our securitization trusts and establishing an allowance for loan and lease losses for the assets underlying these trusts  which reduced retained earnings and our tier risk based capital ratio 
in january  banking regulators issued regulatory capital rules related to the impact of the new consolidation accounting standards 
under these rules  we are required to hold additional capital for the assets we consolidated 
the capital rules also provided for an optional phase in of the impact from the adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards  including a two quarter implementation delay followed by a two quarter partial implementation of the effect on regulatory capital ratios 
we elected the phase in option  which required us to phase in of consolidated assets beginning with the third quarter of for purposes of determining risk weighted assets 
the phase in provisions expired after december   and we completed the final phase in during the first quarter of  which resulted in the addition of approximately billion of assets to the denominator used in calculating our regulatory ratios 
the addition of these assets negatively impacted our risk based regulatory capital ratios as of december  from december  under the dodd frank act  many trust preferred securities will cease to qualify for tier capital  subject to a three year phase out period expected to begin in dividend policy the declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders  as well as the amount thereof  are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our results of operations  financial condition  capital levels  cash requirements  future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
as a bank holding company  our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries 
for additional information on dividends  see item business supervision and regulation dividends  stock purchases and transfer of funds 
regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the banks to transfer funds to our bank holding company 
funds available for dividend payments from cobna and cona based on the earnings limitation test were 
table of contents billion and billion  respectively  as of december  although funds are available for dividend payments from the banks  we would execute a dividend from the banks in consultation with the occ 
applicable provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries may limit our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to us or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends 
we submitted a comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar to the federal reserve on january  along with eighteen other large us banking organizations 
we expect to incorporate any feedback from our regulators in response to the ccar submission in our ongoing capital management planning 
settlement of forward sale agreements on february   we settled forward sale agreements that we entered into with certain counterparties acting as forward purchasers in connection with a public offering of shares of our common stock on july  pursuant to the forward sale agreements  we issued million shares of our common stock at settlement 
after underwriter s discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company were at a forward sale price per share of for a total of approximately billion 
pending hsbc us credit card business acquisition in august  we announced that we entered into a purchase agreement with hsbc to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume liabilities of hsbc s credit card and private label credit card business in the united states 
we currently expect the hsbc acquisition to close in the second quarter of  subject to customary closing conditions  including certain governmental clearances and approvals 
we also announced that we expect a planned capital raise of an estimated billion in connection with the hsbc acquisition 
we have the option  subject to certain conditions  to issue million of the billion to hsbc in the form of our common stock valued at per share 
the decision to raise any capital and  if so  the amount of capital to be raised will be dependent on a number of factors  including the timing of the closing of the pending hsbc acquisition  changes in interest rates  regulatory expectations  our results of operations and financial condition and our assessment of the appropriate level of regulatory capital to hold at that time 
risk management overview risk management is an important part of our business model  as all financial institutions are exposed to a variety of business risks that can significantly affect their financial performance 
our business activities expose us to eight major categories of risks strategic risk  reputational risk  compliance risk  legal risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  market risk and operational risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from a borrower s or a counterparty s inability to meet its financial or contractual obligations 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our future financial obligations as they come due or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period 
market risk market risk is the risk that our earnings and or economic value of equity may be adversely affected by changes in market conditions  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  changes in credit spreads and price fluctuations and changes in value due to changes in market perception or the actual credit quality of issuers 
compliance risk compliance risk is the risk of financial loss due to regulatory fines or penalties  sanctions restricting or suspending our business or costs of mandatory corrective action resulting from a failure to 
table of contents comply with applicable laws  regulations  principles or other supervisory guidance requirements  or our own internal code of conduct and policies intended to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss  adverse customer experience  or negative regulatory or reputation impact resulting from inadequate or failed internal process  human factors  systems  or from external events 
legal risk legal risk represents the risk of material adverse impact due to new or changes in laws and regulations  new interpretations of law  the drafting  interpretation and enforceability of contracts  adverse decisions or consequences arising from litigation or regulatory scrutiny  the establishment  management and governance of our legal entity structure  or the failure to seek or follow appropriate legal counsel when needed 
reputational risk reputational risk is the risk that negative publicity  whether true or not  could adversely affect our market value  profitability  customer base  funding sources or operations or result in costly litigation 
strategic risk strategic risk is the risk that results from adverse business decisions  ineffective or inappropriate business plans  or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment  business cycles  customer preferences  product obsolescence  regulatory environment  business strategy execution  and or other inherent risks of the business 
we discuss below our overall risk management principles  roles and responsibilities  framework and risk appetite 
following this section  we address in more detail the specific procedures  measures and analysis of the major categories of risks that we manage 
risk management principles our risk management framework is intended to identify  assess and mitigate risks that affect or have the potential to affect our business 
we target financial returns that compensate us for the amount of risk that we take and avoid excessive risk taking 
our risk management framework consists of five key risk management principles individual businesses take and manage risk within established tolerance levels in pursuit of strategic  financial and other business objectives 
independent risk management organizations support individual businesses by providing risk management tools and policies and by aggregating risks  in some cases  risks are managed centrally 
the board of directors and senior management review our aggregate risk position  establish the risk appetite and work with management to ensure conformance to policy and adherence to our adopted mitigation strategy 
we employ a top risk identification system to maintain the appropriate focus on the risks and issues that may have the most impact and to identify emerging risks of consequence 
independent assurance functions  such as our internal audit and credit review teams  assess the governance framework and test transactions  business processes and procedures to provide assurance as to whether our risk programs are operating as intended 
our approach is reflected in five critical risk management practices of particular importance in the financial services industry due to changing regulatory environments and ongoing economic uncertainty 
first  we seek to mitigate liquidity risk strategically and tactically 
from a strategic perspective  we have acquired and built deposit gathering businesses and significantly reduced our loan to deposit ratio 
from a tactical perspective  we have accumulated a very large liquidity reserve comprising cash  high quality  unencumbered securities  and committed collateralized credit lines and conduit facilities 
second  we recognize that we are exposed to cyclical changes in credit quality 
consequently  we try to ensure our credit portfolio is resilient to economic downturns 
our most important tool in this endeavor is sound 
table of contents underwriting  using what we deem to be conservative assumptions 
in unsecured consumer loan underwriting  we generally assume that loans will be subject to an environment in which losses are significantly higher than those prevailing at the time of underwriting 
in commercial underwriting  we generally require strong cash flow  collateral and covenants and guarantees 
in addition to sound underwriting  we continually monitor our portfolio and take steps to collect or work out distressed loans 
third  we recognize that compliance is becoming more complex and that regulatory and consumer expectations are rising 
in the aftermath of the financial crisis  new rules and regulations were and continue to be promulgated and a new agency was created  the consumer financial protection bureau  to increase focus on consumer protection 
in response  we have been and will continue to expand the scope and intensity of our compliance activities including developing requirements  approving new products  establishing procedures and controls  training staff and testing the effectiveness of business controls and the overall program 
fourth  we recognize that reputational risk is of particular concern for financial institutions as a result of the aftermath of the recent financial crisis and economic downturn  which has resulted in increased regulation and widespread regulatory changes 
consequently  our chief executive officer and executive team manage both tactical and strategic reputation issues and build our relationships with the government  media and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our company and industry 
our actions include taking public positions in support of better consumer practices in our industry and  where possible  unilaterally implementing those practices in our business 
finally  we recognize that maintaining a strong capital position is essential to our business strategy and competitive position 
we also recognize that regulatory and market expectations for the amount and quality of capital are rising 
understanding and managing risks to our capital position is an underlying objective of all our risk programs 
stress testing and economic capital measurement  both of which incorporate inputs from across the risk spectrum  are key tools for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted returns 
we also consider risks to our reputation and to our ability to access capital markets as part of our process for evaluating our capital plans 
see md a capital management for additional information on our capital adequacy and strength 
risk management roles and responsibilities the board of directors is responsible for establishing our overall risk framework  approving and overseeing execution of the enterprise risk management policy and key risk category policies  establishing our risk appetite  and regularly reviewing our risk profile 
the chief risk officer  who reports to the chief executive officer  is responsible for overseeing our risk management program and driving appropriate action to resolve any weaknesses 
the risk management program begins with a set of policies and risk appetites approved by the board that are implemented through a system of risk committees and senior executive risk stewards 
we have established risk committees at both the corporate and divisional level to identify and manage risk 
in addition  we have assigned a senior executive expert to each of eight risk categories 
we refer to these experts as risk stewards 
these executive risk stewards work with the chief risk officer and the risk committees to identify and report risks  develop mitigation plans and controls and remediate issues 
the chief risk officer aggregates the results of these processes to assemble a view of our risk profile 
both management and the board of directors regularly review the risk profile 
risk management framework we use a consistent risk management framework to manage risk 
this framework applies at all levels  from the development of the enterprise risk management program itself to the tactical operations of the front line business team 
our risk management framework  which is built around governance  processes and people  consists of the following six key elements objective setting 
table of contents risk assessment control activities communication and information program monitoring organization and culture objective setting our risk management approach begins with objective setting 
we establish strategic  financial  operational and other objectives during our strategic and annual planning processes and throughout the year 
these objectives cascade through the organization to individual teams of associates 
the risk management approach helps identify and manage risks that have the potential to interfere with the achievement of our stated objectives 
risk assessment risk assessment is the process of identifying risks to our objectives  evaluating the impact of those risks and choosing and executing on a response 
our risk responses include risk avoidance  mitigation or acceptance 
generally  our risk responses are guided by our established risk appetite 
for certain risk categories legal  compliance  liquidity  credit and market risks  risk assessment is largely conducted by central risk groups or jointly between business areas and central groups 
for other risk categories strategic  reputational and operational risks  risk assessment is primarily the responsibility of business areas with less central support 
control activities we consider our control activities to be the day to day backbone of our risk management 
controls provide reasonable assurance that legal  regulatory  and business requirements are being met  and identified risks are being mitigated  avoided  or accepted according to our risk response choices and risk appetite 
we have practices in place designed to establish key controls and assess their effective in preventing a breakdown 
control activities include the monitoring of adherence to current policy and procedure requirements  sign offs  and regular reporting to management 
they also include the resolution of regulatory and audit findings and issues and the procedures that trigger objective setting and risk assessments when new business opportunities are evaluated or business hierarchy changes occur 
communication and information communication and information infrastructures must be solid and are necessary to support the objective setting  risk assessment  and control activities described above 
robust risk management requires well functioning communication channels to inform associates of their responsibilities  alert them to issues or changes that might affect their activities  and to enable an open flow of information up  down  and across our company 
robust risk management also requires management information to enable controls to work effectively and to support the analysis needed to set objectives and assess risk accurately 
our risk governance structure is designed to support solid and ongoing communication 
specific reports and communication infrastructure are defined within our individual risk category policies 
program monitoring program monitoring is critical to our overall risk management program 
program monitoring involves assessing the accuracy  sufficiency  and effectiveness of current objectives  risk assessments  controls  ownership  communication  and management support 
the assessment of a risk program or activity can be qualitative or quantitative 
we encourage the use of measurements and metrics where it is possible  recognizing that some risks 
table of contents or programs cannot be measured quantitatively 
where deficiencies are discovered  we seek to update the risk management program to resolve the deficiencies in a timely manner 
significant deficiencies are escalated to the appropriate risk executive or risk committee 
clear accountability is defined when resolving deficiencies so that the desired outcome is achieved 
risk management programs are monitored at every level from the overall enterprise risk management program to the individual risk management activities in each business area 
organization and culture our intent is to create and maintain an effective risk management organization and culture 
a strong organization and culture promotes risk management as a key factor in making important business decisions and helps drive risk management activities deeper into the company 
an effective risk management culture starts with a well defined risk management philosophy 
it requires established risk management objectives that align to business objectives and make targeted risk management activities part of ongoing business management activities 
we believe we staff risk functions at the appropriate levels with qualified associates and effective tools that support risk management practices and activities 
senior management and the board of directors are ultimately accountable for promoting adherence to sound risk principles and tolerances 
we seek to incent associates at all levels to perform according to corporate policies and risk tolerance and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations 
additionally  management establishes performance goals  plans  and incentives that are designed to promote financial performance within the confines of a sound risk management program and within defined risk tolerances 
we have a corporate code of business conduct and ethics the code available on the corporate governance page of our website at www 
capitalone 
com about under which each associate is obligated to behave with integrity in dealing with customers and business partners and to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
we disclose any waivers to the code on our website 
we also have an associate performance management process that emphasizes achieving business results while ensuring integrity  compliance  and sound business management 
risk appetite we have a defined risk appetite for each of our eight risk categories that is approved by the board of directors 
stated risk appetites define the parameters for taking and accepting risks and are used by management and the board of directors to make business decisions 
for some risk categories credit  liquidity  market  our risk appetite statements are translated into largely quantitative limits and guidelines 
for other risk categories  our risk appetite is defined more qualitatively and is supported by indicative metrics where appropriate 
we communicate risk appetite statements  metrics and limits to the appropriate levels in the organization and monitor adherence 
primary risk categories below we provide an overview of how we manage our eight primary risk categories 
following this section  we provide detailed information and metrics about three of our most significant risk exposures credit  liquidity and market 
credit risk management the chief risk officer  in conjunction with the consumer and commercial chief credit officers  is responsible for establishing credit risk policies and procedures  including underwriting and hold guidelines and credit approval authority  and monitoring credit exposure and performance of our lending related transactions 
these responsibilities are fulfilled by the chief consumer credit officer and the chief commercial credit officer 
division presidents are responsible for managing the credit risk within their division and maintaining processes 
table of contents to control credit risk and comply with credit policies and guidelines 
in addition  the chief risk officer establishes policies  delegates approval authority and monitors performance for non loan credit exposure entered into with financial counterparties or through the purchase of credit sensitive securities in our investment portfolio 
our credit policies establish standards in five areas customer selection  underwriting  monitoring  remediation  and portfolio management 
the standards in each area provide a framework comprising specific objectives and control processes 
these standards are supported by detailed policies and procedures for each component of the credit process 
starting with customer selection  our goal is to provide credit on terms that generate above hurdle returns 
we use stress tests in conjunction with our planning process to establish specific limits to help us achieve that goal 
we apply quantitative credit risk limits and guidelines to each of our lines of business 
we monitor performance and forecasts relative to these guidelines and report results and any required mitigating actions to the credit policy committee and to the audit and risk committee of the board

trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator  among other considerations  of credit risk within our loan portfolios 
the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses 
accordingly  key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates  as well as charge off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance  commercial loans 
the improvements we have experienced in our credit trends across all of our businesses are stabilizing and our credit performance is increasingly driven by seasonal trends 
we present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio  including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio 
see note loans for additional details 
delinquency rates we consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer s billing statement 
table compares day performing loan delinquency rates  by loan category  as of december  and we also present total day delinquent loans 
our day delinquency metrics include all held for investment loans that are or more days past due  whereas our day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are or more days past due and that are also currently classified as performing and accruing interest 
the day delinquency and day performing 
table of contents delinquency metrics are the same for credit card loans  as we continue to classify credit card loans as performing until they are charged off  generally when the loan is days past due 
however  the day delinquency and day performing delinquency metrics differ for other loan categories based on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming 
see note loans for additional information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming and for charging off loans 
the delinquency rates presented are calculated  by loan category  based on our total loan portfolio 
our total loan portfolio consists of loans recorded on our balance sheet  which includes purchased credit impaired pci loans acquired from chevy chase bank and loans held in our securitization trusts

table summarizes loans that were days or more past due as to interest or principal and still accruing interest as of december   and these loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between days and days past due 
as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the ffiec  we continue to accrue interest on credit card loans through the date of charge off  typically in the period the account becomes days past due

nonperforming assets nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and foreclosed property and repossessed assets 
nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
we do not report loans accounted for under the fair value option and loans held for sale as nonperforming 
our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming  by loan category  are as follows credit card loans as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the ffiec  our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes days past due 
consistent with industry conventions  we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged off 
when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of the credit card account by the estimated uncollectible portion of any billed finance charges and fees and exclude this amount from revenue 
installment loans are included in our credit card segment and classified as nonperforming when the loan is days past due 
consumer loans we classify other non credit card consumer loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or when the loan is days past due for auto  home loans  and unsecured small business revolving lines of credit and days past due for all other non credit card consumer loans 
commercial loans we classify commercial loans as nonperforming as of the date we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured 
modified loans and troubled debt restructurings modified loans  including troubled debt restructurings tdrs  that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected 
otherwise  the modified loan is classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance over several payment cycles  generally six months of consecutive payments  under the modified terms of the loan 
purchased credit impaired loans pci loans primarily include loans acquired from chevy chase bank  which we recorded at fair value at acquisition 
because the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans  our subsequent accounting for pci loans differs from the accounting for non pci loans 
we therefore separately track and report pci loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics

table of contents net charge offs net charge offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible  net of recovered amounts 
we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge offs 
charge offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
costs incurred to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non interest expense 
our charge off time frame for loans  which varies based on the loan type  is presented below 
credit card loans we generally charge off credit card loans when the account is days past due from the statement cycle date 
credit card loans in bankruptcy are charged off within days of receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court  except for uk credit card loans  which are charged off within days 
credit card loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
consumer loans we generally charge off consumer loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral 
our charge off time frame is days for home loans and unsecured small business lines of credit and days for auto and other non credit card consumer loans 
we calculate the charge off amount for home loans based on the difference between our recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the underlying property and estimated selling costs as of the date of the charge off 
we update our home value estimates on a regular basis and recognize additional charge offs for declines in home values below our initial fair value and selling cost estimate at the date home loans are charged off 
consumer loans in bankruptcy  except for auto and home loans  generally are charged off within days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court 
auto and home loans in bankruptcy are charged off in the period that the loan is both days or more past due and days or more past the bankruptcy notification date or in the period the loan becomes days past due for auto loans and days past due for home loans regardless of the bankruptcy notification date 
consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
commercial loans we charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible 
purchased credit impaired loans we do not record charge offs on purchased credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component

loan modifications and restructurings as part of our customer retention efforts  we may modify loans for certain borrowers who have demonstrated performance under the previous terms 
as part of our loss mitigation efforts  we may make loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty that are intended to minimize our economic loss and avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral 
we may provide short term three to twelve months or long term greater than twelve months modifications to improve the long term collectability of the loan 
our most common types of modifications include a reduction in the borrower s initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term  a reduction in the interest rate  or a combination of both 
these modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due  or certain installments due  under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan 
in some cases  we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower 
loan modifications in which an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are accounted for and reported as tdrs 
we also classify loan modifications that involve a trial period as tdrs 
in the third quarter of  we adopted accounting guidance that provides clarification on determining whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and whether a concession has been granted to the debtor for purposes of determining if a loan modification constitutes a tdr

in some cases  the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non payment  late payment or similar events 
we determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve an increase and are considered to be a tdr based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program 
in all cases  we cancel the customer s available line of credit on the credit card 
if the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms  then the credit card loan agreement will revert back to its original payment terms  with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category

impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
loans defined as individually impaired  based on applicable accounting guidance  include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and tdr loans 
we do not report nonperforming consumer loans that have not been modified in a tdr as individually impaired  as we collectively evaluate these smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance

purchased credit impaired loans purchased credit impaired loans decreased to billion as of december   from billion as of december  our portfolio of purchased credit impaired loans consists of loans acquired in the chevy chase bank transaction  which were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans 
therefore  no allowance for loan and lease losses was recorded for these loans as of the acquisition date 
however  we regularly update the amount of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results on an aggregated pool basis for loans with common risk characteristics 
probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through our provision for loan and lease losses 
probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and losses  with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans 
we reduced the allowance related to this pool of loans by million for the year ended december  we recorded impairment through our provision for loan and losses of million for the year ended december  the cumulative impairment recognized on pci loans totaled million as of december  and million as of december  the credit performance of the remaining pools has generally been in line with our expectations  and  in some cases  more favorable than expected  which has resulted in the reclassification of amounts from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield 
we provide additional information on the pci loans acquired from chevy chase bank in note loans 
allowance for loan and lease losses our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we do not maintain an allowance for held for sale loans or purchased credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component

market risk profile market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities  including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives 
below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk  our market risk management strategies and measures used to evaluate our market risk exposure 
primary market risk exposures our primary sources of market risk include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk  which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the level or volatility of interest rates  is our most significant source of market risk exposure 
banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities 
for example  if more assets are repricing than deposits and other borrowings when interest rates are declining  our earnings will decrease 
similarly  if more deposits and other borrowings are repricing than assets when interest rates are rising  our earnings will decrease 

table of contents interest rate risk also results from changes in customer behavior and competitors responses to changes in interest rates or other market conditions 
for example  decreases in mortgage rates generally result in faster than expected prepayments  which may adversely affect earnings 
increases in interest rates  coupled with strong demand from competitors for deposits  may influence industry pricing 
such competition may affect customer decisions to maintain balances in the deposit accounts  which may require replacing lower cost deposits with higher cost alternative sources of funding 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies 
the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated loans and securities  future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions  foreign currency denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates 
we are exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates  which may impact the earnings of our foreign operations 
our asset liability management policy requires that we use derivatives to hedge material foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk 
the estimated reduction in our month earnings due to adverse foreign exchange rate movements corresponding to a probability was less than as of december  and the precision of this estimate is limited due to the inherent uncertainty of the underlying forecast assumptions 
market risk management we employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk  which include  but are not limited to  changing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities 
derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
we execute our derivative contracts in both over the counter and exchange traded derivative markets 
although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps  we also use a variety of other derivative instruments  including caps  floors  options  futures and forward contracts  to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  this increase was primarily attributable to actions we took to manage the anticipated impact of the ing direct acquisition on our market risk exposure and regulatory capital requirements 
from the date we entered into the agreement to acquire ing direct to early august  interest rates declined substantially  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the ing direct net assets and liabilities 
in order to capture some of the anticipated benefits to regulatory capital on the closing date attributable to this decline in interest rates  in early august  we entered into various interest rate swap transactions with a total notional principal amount of approximately billion 
we subsequently rebalanced the hedge in october adding an additional billion in notional principal for a total combined notional principal amount of approximately billion 
these combined swap transactions were intended to mitigate the effect of a rise in interest rates on the fair values of a significant portion of the ing direct assets and liabilities during the period from when we entered into the swap transactions to the anticipated closing date of the ing direct acquisition in early although the interest rate swaps represented economic hedges  they were not designated for hedge accounting under us gaap 
therefore  we recorded changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in earnings 
in  we recorded a mark to market loss of million related to these interest rate swaps  which was attributable to the decline in interest rates 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ing direct on february   we terminated the billion in interest rate swaps related to the acquisition 
at termination  the fair value of the swaps was a net loss of million 
based on current estimates  we believe the interest rate swaps related to the acquisition were effective in meeting our hedging objective 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities for additional information 

table of contents market risk measurement we have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our asset liability management committee 
our objective is to manage our asset liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long term expectations 
because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk  we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure  assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates on our earnings and the economic value of equity 
we consider the impact on both earnings and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk 
our earnings sensitivity measure estimates the impact on net interest income and the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights  including derivative hedging activity  resulting from movements in interest rates 
our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities  including derivative hedging activity  resulting from movements in interest rates 
our earnings sensitivity and economic value of equity measurements are based on our existing assets and liabilities  including derivatives  and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes 
we do  however  assess and factor into our interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of growth assumptions  changing business activities and alternative interest rate scenarios  such as a steepening or flattening of the yield curve 
under our current asset liability management policy  our objective is to i limit the potential decrease in our projected net interest income resulting from a gradual plus or minus basis point change in forward rates to less than over the next months and ii limit the adverse change in the economic value of our equity due to an instantaneous parallel interest rate shock to spot rates of plus or minus basis points to less than 
the federal funds rate remained at a target range of zero to during given the level of short term rates as of december  and  a scenario where interest rates would decline by basis points is not plausible 
in  we temporarily revised our customary declining interest rate scenario of basis points to a basis point decrease  except in scenarios where a basis point decline would result in a rate less than in which case we assume a rate scenario of  to compensate for the continued low rate environment 
our current asset liability management policy also includes the use of derivatives to hedge material foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk 
table shows the estimated percentage impact on our adjusted projected net interest income and economic value of equity  calculated under our base case interest rate scenario  as of december  and  resulting from selected hypothetical interest rate scenarios 
our adjusted projected net interest income consists of net interest income adjusted to include changes in the fair value of mortgage service rights  including related derivative hedging activity  and changes in the fair value of free standing interest rate swaps 
in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our adjusted projected net interest income  we assume a hypothetical gradual increase in interest rates of basis points and a hypothetical gradual decrease of basis points to forward rates over the next twelve months 
in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity  we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of plus basis points and minus basis points to spot rates in measuring the sensitivity of the valuation of our economic value of equity 

table of contents table interest rate sensitivity analysis december  excluding ing direct swaps including ing direct swaps december  impact on adjusted projected base line net interest income basis points basis points impact on economic value of equity basis points basis points calculated excluding the impact of the interest rate swap transactions of approximately billion entered into to mitigate some of the interest rate risk related to the ing direct acquisition 
because of the large but temporary impact of the ing direct related swap transactions on our standard interest rate risk reporting measures  we expanded our standard interest rate sensitivity analysis to present our interest rate risk measures with and without the impact of the billion of interest rate swaps described above 
this presentation highlights changes in our core interest rate risk profile and the incremental impact of the ing direct related swaps on our core profile over the time period that the swaps will remain outstanding 
excluding the billion swap transactions  our interest rate sensitivity measures reflect that we became more asset sensitive between december  and december  our asset sensitivity position is larger when factoring in the effect of the billion of swaps  given their net pay fixed structure and non designation for hedge accounting in accordance with gaap 
our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures  both including and excluding the impact of the ing direct related swap transactions  were within our prescribed asset liability policy limits as of december  and as noted above  in conjunction with our close of the ing direct acquisition on february   we terminated the ing direct related swap transactions in february the interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information  internally developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies  which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments 
other market inputs  such as interest rates  market prices and interest rate volatility  are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures 
we regularly evaluate  update and enhance these assumptions  models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities 
limitations of market risk measures there are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates 
the above sensitivity analyses contemplate only certain movements in interest rates and are performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet  and do not incorporate other factors that may have a significant effect  most notably future business activities and strategic actions that management may take to manage interest rate risk 
actual earnings and economic value of equity could differ from the above sensitivity analyses

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements note summary of significant accounting policies the company capital one financial corporation  which was established in  is a diversified financial services holding company headquartered in mclean  virginia 
capital one financial corporation and its subsidiaries the company offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers  small businesses and commercial clients through branches  the internet and other distribution channels 
our principal subsidiaries include capital one bank usa  national association cobna and capital one  national association cona 
the company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as we  us or our 
cona and cobna are hereafter collectively referred to as the banks 
as one of the top largest banks in the united states based on deposits  we serve banking customers through branch locations primarily in new york  new jersey  texas  louisiana  maryland  virginia and the district of columbia 
in addition to bank lending and depository services  we offer credit and debit card products  mortgage banking and treasury management services 
we offer our products outside of the united states principally through operations in the united kingdom and canada 
our principal operations are currently organized into three primary business segments  which are defined based on the products and services provided  or the type of customer served credit card  consumer banking and commercial banking 
credit card consists of our domestic consumer and small business credit card lending  domestic small business lending  national closed end installment lending and the international credit card lending businesses in canada and the united kingdom 
consumer banking consists of our branch based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumer and small businesses  national deposit gathering  national auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities 
commercial banking consists of our lending  deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and middle market customers 
our middle market customers typically include commercial and industrial companies with annual revenues between million and billion 
certain activities that are not part of a segment are included in the other category 
the results of our individual businesses are prepared based on our internal management accounting system and reflect the manner in which management measures and evaluates performance 
the accounting policies with respect to activities specifically attributable to each business segment are generally the same as those used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
however  the preparation of business line results requires management to allocate funding costs and benefits  expenses and other financial elements to each line of business 
for details of our business segment accounting policies  allocation methodologies and business segment results  see note business segments 
basis of presentation and use of estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
additionally  where applicable  the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
these estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
while management makes its best judgment  actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of capital one financial corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
we determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie 
voting interest entities voting interest entities are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations 
the usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest 
accordingly  we consolidate our majority owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold  directly or indirectly  more than of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights 
investments in entities where we do not have a controlling financial interest but we have significant influence over the entity s financial and operating decisions generally defined as owning a voting interest of to are accounted for under the equity method 
if we own less than of a voting interest entity  we generally carry the investment at cost  except marketable equity securities  which we carry at fair value with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we typically report investments accounted for under the equity or cost method in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  and include our share of income or loss in other non interest income in our consolidated statements of income 
variable interest entities vies vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
either the entity does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or the entity has equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity s operations through voting rights  or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses  or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity 
the entity that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature  size and form of our involvement with the vie  such as our role in establishing the vie and our ongoing rights and responsibilities  our economic interests  including debt and equity investments  servicing fees  and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the vie  the design of the vie  including the capitalization structure  subordination of interests  payment priority  relative share of interests held across various classes within the vie s capital structure and the reasons why the interests are held by us 
we perform on going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the majority voting interest framework have become vies  based on certain events  and are therefore subject to the vie consolidation framework and whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with a vie result in a change in our consolidation conclusion 
our reassessment process considers whether we have acquired or divested the power to direct the activities of the vie through changes in governing documents or other circumstances 
the reassessment also considers whether we have acquired or disposed of a financial interest that could be significant to the vie  or whether an interest in the vie has become significant or is no longer significant 
the consolidation status of the vies with which we are involved may change as a result of such reassessments 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and resale agreements and interest bearing deposits at other banks  all of which  if applicable  have stated maturities of three months or less when acquired 
cash payments for interest expense totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash payments for income taxes totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
resale and repurchase agreements securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  principally us government and agency obligations  are not accounted for as sales but as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold  plus accrued interest 
we receive securities purchased under agreements to resell  make delivery of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  continually monitor the market value of these securities and deliver or obtain additional collateral as appropriate 
investment securities our investment securities consist primarily of fixed income debt securities and equity securities 
the accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities differs depending on the security classification 
we classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time and may sell prior to maturity in response to changes in our investment strategy  liquidity needs  interest rate risk profile or for other reasons are classified as available for sale 
all of our investment securities were classified as available for sale as of december  and although we currently do not have any securities classified as held to maturity  we may elect to do so in the future 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized net gains or losses  net of taxes  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
for most of our investment securities  interest income is recognized using the effective interest method 
deferred items  including unamortized premiums  discounts and other basis adjustments  are recognized in interest income over the contractual lives of the securities using the effective interest method 
we record purchases and sales of securities on a trade date basis 
realized gains and losses from the sale of debt securities are computed using the specific identification method and included in non interest income in our consolidated statements of income 
we regularly evaluate our securities whose value has declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary 
amortized cost reflects historical cost adjusted for amortization of premiums  accretion of discounts and other than temporary impairment writedowns 
we discuss our assessment of and accounting for other than temporary impairment in note investment securities 
we discuss the techniques we use in determining the fair value of our investment securities in note fair value of financial instruments 
loans our loan portfolio consists of credit card  other consumer and commercial loans 
other consumer loans consist of auto  home  and retail banking loans 
commercial loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate  middle market  specialty lending and small ticket commercial real estate loans 
we historically have securitized 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued credit card loans  auto loans  home loans and installment loans through trusts we established to purchase the loans 
the primary purposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and generate liquidity 
prior to january   the transfers of these loans to securitization trusts were generally accounted for as sales and the sold assets were removed from our consolidated balance sheets  which resulted in favorable regulatory capital treatment 
as a result of our january  adoption of the new consolidation accounting standards  we have consolidated these securitization trusts 
the loans underlying consolidated trusts are reported on our consolidated balance sheet under restricted loans for securitization investors 
loan classification we classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management s assessment of our intent and ability to hold loans for the foreseeable future or until maturity 
management s intent and ability with respect to certain loans may change from time to time depending on a number of factors  including economic  liquidity and capital conditions 
the accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification and whether the loans are originated or purchased 
the accounting for purchased loans also differs depending on whether the loan is considered credit impaired at the date of acquisition 
the classification criteria and accounting and measurement framework for loans held for investment  loans held for sale and purchased credit impaired loans are described below 
loans held for investment loans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with on balance sheet securitization transactions accounted for as secured borrowings are classified as held for investment 
the substantial majority of our loans  which include unrestricted loans and restricted loans for securitization investors  are classified as held for investment 
credit card loans classified as held for investment are reported at their outstanding unpaid principal balance plus uncollected billed interest and fees net of billed interest and fees deemed uncollectible 
other loans classified as held for investment  except for purchased credit impaired loans  are reported at amortized cost 
amortized cost is measured based on the outstanding unpaid principal amount  net of unearned income  unamortized deferred fees and costs and charge offs 
we generally defer certain loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans  premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees and recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and or commitment period or  for credit card loans  over a twelve month period  using the effective interest method 
interest income is recognized on loans held for investment  other than purchased credit impaired loans  on an accrual basis 
we establish an allowance for loan losses for probable losses inherent in our held for investment loan portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
cash flows related to unrestricted loans held for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows regardless of a subsequent change in intent 
because our securitization transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings  the cash flows from these transactions are presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than as cash flows from operating or investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows beginning in loans held for sale loans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale 
prior to january  we classified credit card loans necessary to support new 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued securitization transactions expected to take place in the next three months as held for sale 
management limited the timeframe in which it believed it could reasonably estimate the amount of existing credit card loans to support securitization transactions to three months because of the uncertainty of customer repayment behavior and the revolving nature of credit cards 
loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value as determined on an aggregate homogeneous portfolio basis  with any write downs or recoveries in fair value up to the amortized cost recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non interest income 
we recognize interest on loans held for sale classified as performing on an accrual basis 
because loans held for sale are reported at lower of cost or fair value  an allowance for loan losses is not established for loans held for sale 
the fair value of loans held for sale is estimated based on secondary market prices for loan portfolios with similar characteristics 
in certain circumstances  we may transfer loans to from held for sale or held for investment based on a change in strategy 
we transfer these loans at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer and establish a new cost basis upon transfer 
write downs on loans transferred from held for investment to held for sale are recorded as charge offs at the time of transfer 
we execute whole loan sales with either servicing rights released to the buyer or retained 
when loans are sold and the servicing rights are released to the buyer  the gain or loss recognized on the sale is calculated based on the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold 
when loans are sold and the servicing rights are retained  the fair value attributed to the retained servicing rights impacts the gain or loss recognized on the sale 
we report gains or losses on loans held for sale when realized in other non interest income 
we originated million and billion of conforming residential mortgage loans for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we retained servicing on approximately and of the conforming residential mortgage loans we sold for the years ended december  and  respectively and recognized gains of million  million  and less than million of the sale of held for sale loans for the years ended december    and  respectively 
loans acquired all purchased loans  including loans transferred in a business combination  acquired on or after january   are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition 
accordingly  any related allowance for loan losses is not carried over 
loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are considered purchased credit impaired pci loans 
evidence of credit deterioration may include statistics such as delinquency and accrual status  current loan to value ratio  the geographic location of the borrower or collateral and internal risk ratings 
in connection with the acquisition of chevy chase bank on february   we concluded that the substantial majority of loans we acquired from chevy chase bank were pci loans 
see note acquisitions and restructuring activities and note loans for additional information 
in accounting for pci loans we first determine the contractually required payments due  which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments  adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayments 
we then estimate the undiscounted cash flows we expect to collect 
we incorporate several key 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued assumptions to estimate cash flows expected to be collected  including default rates  loss severities and the amount and timing of prepayments 
we estimate the fair value by discounting the estimated cash flows we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest  when available  adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value 
we are permitted to aggregate pci loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pools if the loans have common risk characteristics 
a pool is then accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flows 
the difference between contractually required payments due and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition  considering the impact of prepayments  is referred to as the nonaccretable difference 
the nonaccretable difference  which is neither accreted into income nor recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  reflects estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
the excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of pci loans is referred to as the accretable yield 
this amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  but is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan  or pool of loans  using the effective interest method 
subsequent to acquisition  we complete quarterly evaluations of expected cash flows 
decreases in expected cash flows attributable to credit will generally result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan and lease losses and the establishment of an allowance for loan and lease losses 
increases in expected cash flows will generally result in a reduction in any allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition and an increase in the accretable yield through a reclassification from the nonaccretable difference 
the adjusted accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan  or pool of loans 
disposals of loans  which may include sales of loans to third parties  receipt of payments in full or part by the borrower  and foreclosure of the collateral result in removal of the loan from the pci loan portfolio at its carrying amount 
because the initial fair value of pci loans recorded at acquisition includes an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans  we separately track and report pci loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics 
even though substantially all of these loans are days or more contractually past due  they are considered to be accruing since we have a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected 
for acquired loans that are not deemed impaired at acquisition  subsequent to acquisition we recognize the difference between the initial fair value at acquisition and the undiscounted expected cash flows in interest income over the life of the loans using the effective interest method 
loan modifications and restructurings as part of our loss mitigation efforts  we may make loan modifications that are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral 
we may provide short term three to twelve months or long term greater than twelve months modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long term loan performance and collectability 
our modifications typically include a reduction in the borrower s initial monthly or quarterly principal and interest payment through an extension of the loan term  a reduction in the interest rate  or a combination of both 
for credit card loan agreements  such modifications may include canceling the customer s available line of credit on the credit card  reducing the interest rate on the card  and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding months 
these modifications may result in our receiving the full amount due  or certain installments due  under the loan over a period of time that is longer than the period of time originally provided for under the terms of the loan 
in some cases  we may curtail the amount of principal owed by the borrower 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued a loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty is accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
we describe our accounting for and measurement of impairment on restructured loans below under impaired loans 
see note loans for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings 
delinquent and nonperforming loans the entire balance of a loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer s billing statement 
delinquency is reported on loans that are or more days past due 
interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status  if applicable 
we generally place loans on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured 
nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
we do not report loans accounted for under the fair value option and loans held for sale as nonperforming 
our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming  by loan category  are as follows credit card loans as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec  our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes days past due 
consistent with industry conventions  we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged off 
when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of the credit card account by the estimated uncollectible portion of any billed finance charges and fees and exclude this amount from revenue 
consumer loans we classify other non credit card consumer loans as nonperforming at the earlier of the date when we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured or in the period in which the loan becomes days past due for auto  home loans  and unsecured small business revolving lines of credit and days past due for all other non credit card consumer loans  including installment loans 
commercial loans we classify commercial loans as nonperforming as of the date we determine that the collectability of interest or principal on the loan is not reasonably assured 
modified loans and troubled debt restructurings modified loans  including tdrs  that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected 
otherwise  the modified loan is classified as nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance over several payment cycles  generally six months of consecutive payments  under the modified terms of the loan 
purchased credit impaired loans pci loans primarily include loans acquired from chevy chase bank  which we recorded at fair value at acquisition 
because the initial fair value of these loans included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans  our subsequent accounting for pci loans differs from the accounting for non pci loans 
we therefore separately track and report pci loans and exclude these loans from our delinquency and nonperforming loan statistics 
interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended 
interest and fee income is 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payments 
however  if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal  all cash received is applied against the principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful 
impaired loans a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan 
loans with insignificant delays or insignificant short falls in the amount of payments expected to be collected are not considered to be impaired 
income recognition on impaired loans is consistent with that of nonaccrual loans discussed above under delinquent and nonperforming loans 
loans defined as individually impaired  based on applicable accounting guidance  include larger balance nonperforming loans and tdr loans 
our policies for identifying loans as individually impaired  by loan category  are as follows credit card loans credit card loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for as individually impaired 
consumer loans consumer loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for as individually impaired 
commercial loans commercial loans classified as nonperforming and commercial loans that have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring are reported as impaired 
purchased credit impaired loans we track and report pci loans separately from other impaired loans 
we do not report nonperforming consumer loans that have not been modified in a tdr as individually impaired  as we collectively evaluate these smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
held for sale loans are also not reported as impaired  as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value 
all individually impaired loans are evaluated for an asset specific allowance 
once a loan is modified in a troubled debt restructuring  the loan is generally considered impaired until maturity regardless of whether the borrower performs under the modified terms 
although the loan may be returned to accrual status if the criteria above under delinquent and nonperforming loans are met  the loan would continue to be evaluated for an asset specific allowance for loan losses and we would continue to report the loan as impaired 
we generally measure impairment and the related asset specific allowance for individually impaired loans based on the difference between the recorded investment of the loan and present value of the loans expected future cash flows  discounted at the effective original interest rate of the loan at the time of modification or the loan s observable market price 
if the loan is collateral dependent  we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral  which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
loans are identified as collateral dependent if we believe that collateral is the sole source of repayment 
if the fair value of the loan is less than the recorded investment  we recognize impairment by either a direct write down or establishing an allowance for the loan or by adjusting an allowance for the impaired loan 
see note allowance for loan and lease losses for additional information on the asset specific component of our allowance 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued charge offs net charge offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible  net of recovered amounts 
we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge offs 
charge offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
costs incurred to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non interest expense 
our charge off time frame for loans  which varies based on the loan type  is presented below 
credit card loans we generally charge off credit card loans when the account is days past due from the statement cycle date 
credit card loans in bankruptcy are charged off within days of receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court  except for uk credit card loans  which are charged offs within days 
credit card loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
consumer loans we generally charge off consumer loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral 
our charge off time frame is days for home loans and unsecured small business lines of credit and days for auto and other non credit card consumer loans 
we calculate the charge off amount for home loans based on the difference between our recorded investment in the loan and the fair value of the underlying property and estimated selling costs as of the date of the charge off 
we update our home value estimates on a regular basis and recognize additional charge offs for declines in home values below our initial fair value and selling cost estimate at the date home loans are charged off 
consumer loans in bankruptcy  except for auto and home loans  generally are charged off within days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court 
auto and home loans in bankruptcy are charged off in the period that the loan is both days or more past due and days or more past the bankruptcy notification date or in the period the loan becomes days past due for auto loans and days past due for home regardless of the bankruptcy notification date 
consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off within days of receipt of notification 
commercial loans we charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amounts are uncollectible 
purchased credit impaired loans we do not record charge offs on pci loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component 
we record charge offs on purchased credit impaired loans only if actual losses exceed estimated losses incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition 
foreclosed property and repossessed assets foreclosed property and repossessed assets are comprised of any asset or property acquired through loan restructurings  workouts  foreclosure proceeding or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
acquired property may include commercial and residential real estate properties or personal property  such as autos 
upon repossession of property acquired in satisfaction of a loan  we reclassify the loan to repossessed assets and record the acquired property at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs 
we estimate fair values primarily based on appraisals  when available  or quoted market prices on liquid assets 
anticipated recoveries from private mortgage insurance and government guarantees are also considered in evaluating the potential impairment of loans at the date of transfer 
when the anticipated future cash flows associated with a loan are less than its net carrying value  a charge off is recognized against the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued we regularly evaluate the fair value of acquired property and subsequently record at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition or the current fair value less estimated disposition costs 
any valuation adjustments on acquired property or gains or losses realized from disposition of the property are reflected in non interest expense 
foreclosed property and repossessed assets  which we report in our consolidated balance sheet under other assets  totaled million and million  respectively  as of december   compared with million and million  respectively  as of december  allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance that represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we do not maintain an allowance for held for sale loans or purchased credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for loan and lease losses and reduced by net charge offs 
the provision for loan and lease losses  which is charged to earnings  reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge offs 
charge offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added 
in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses  we disaggregate loans in our portfolio with similar credit risk characteristics into portfolio segments 
management performs quarterly analysis of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses 
we apply documented systematic methodologies to separately calculate the allowance for our consumer loan and commercial loan portfolio and for loans within each of these portfolios that we identify as individually impaired 
our allowance for loan and lease losses consists of three components that are allocated to cover the estimated probable losses in each loan portfolio based on the results of our detailed review and loan impairment assessment process a formula based component for loans collectively evaluated for impairment  an asset specific component for individually impaired loans  and a component related to purchased credit impaired loans that have experienced significant decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition 
our consumer loan portfolio consists of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  divided into four primary portfolio segments credit card loans  auto loans  residential home loans and retail banking loans 
each of these portfolios is further divided by our business units into pools based on common risk characteristics  such as origination year  contract type  interest rate and geography that are collectively evaluated for impairment 
the commercial loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
these loans are subject to individual reviews that result in risk ratings 
in assessing the risk rating of a particular loan  among the factors we consider are the financial condition of the borrower  geography  collateral performance  historical loss experience  and industry specific information that management believes is relevant in determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
these factors are based on an evaluation of historical and current information  and involve subjective assessment and interpretation 
emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan 
the formula based component of the allowance for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation 
because of the homogenous nature of our consumer loan portfolios  the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluations 
the allowance is 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued established through a process that begins with estimates of incurred losses in each pool based upon various statistical analyses 
loss forecast models are utilized to estimate incurred losses and consider several portfolio indicators including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  account seasoning  the value of collateral underlying secured loans  estimated foreclosures or defaults based on observable trends  delinquencies  bankruptcy filings  unemployment and credit bureau scores  and general economic and business trends 
management believes these factors are relevant in estimating incurred losses and also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation  underwriting and collection management policies  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  general economic conditions and business trends and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance 
we update our consumer loss forecast models and portfolio indicators on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment 
the formula based component of the allowance for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on our historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio  supplemented by management judgment and interpretation 
we apply internal risk ratings to commercial loans  which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default default rate and loss given default loss severity 
we generally use the prior three year actual portfolio credit loss experience to develop our estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived  taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors  including general economic conditions  specific industry and geographic trends  portfolio concentrations  trends in internal credit quality indicators and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates 
the asset specific component of the allowance covers smaller balance homogenous credit card and consumer loans whose terms have been modified in a tdr and larger balance nonperforming  non homogenous commercial loans 
as discussed above under impaired loans  we generally measure the asset specific component of the allowance based on the difference between the recorded investment of individually impaired loans and the present value of expected future cash flows 
when the present value is lower than the carrying value of the loan  impairment is recognized through the provision for loan and lease losses 
if the loan is collateral dependent  we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral  which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
the asset specific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets 
the asset specific component of the allowance for larger balance  commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan 
key considerations in determining the allowance include the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment history  prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors  and when applicable  the estimated realizable value of any collateral 
purchased credit impaired loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting for impaired loans acquired in a transfer 
subsequent to acquisition  decreases in expected principal cash flows of purchased impaired loans are recorded as a valuation allowance included in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent increases in expected principal cash flows result in a recovery of any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses  to the extent applicable 
write downs on purchased impaired loans in excess of the nonaccretable difference are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
see note loans for information on purchased credit impaired portfolios associated with acquisitions 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and financial guarantees  and binding unfunded loan commitments 
the provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for loan and lease losses on our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
we assess these risk classifications  in conjunction with historical loss experience  utilization assumptions  current economic conditions  performance trends within specific portfolio segments and other pertinent information to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of the factors then prevailing  may result in significant changes in the allowances for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods 
special purpose entities and variable interest entities effective january   we prospectively adopted two accounting standards that had a significant impact on our accounting for entities previously considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
the adoption of these new accounting standards resulted in the consolidation of our credit card securitization trusts  one of our installment loan trusts and certain option adjustable rate mortgages option arm loan trusts originated by chevy chase bank 
prior to january   transfers of our credit card receivables  installment loans and certain option adjustable rate mortgage loans to our securitization trusts were accounted for as sales and treated as off balance sheet 
at the adoption of these new accounting standards on january   we added to our reported consolidated balance sheet billion of assets  consisting primarily of credit card loan receivables underlying the consolidated securitization trusts  along with billion of related debt issued by these trusts to third party investors 
we also recorded an after tax charge to retained earnings on january  of billion  reflecting the net cumulative effect of adopting these new accounting standards 
this charge primarily related to the addition of billion to our allowance for loan and lease losses for the newly consolidated loans and the recording of billion in related deferred tax assets 
the initial recording of these amounts on our reported balance sheet as of january  had no impact on our reported income 
securitization of loans we primarily securitize credit card loans  auto loans  home loans and installment loans 
securitizations have historically been utilized for liquidity and funding purposes 
see note variable interest entities and securitizations and note goodwill and other intangible assets for additional details 
loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to a trust from which the trust sells an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third party investors through the issuance of debt securities 
the debt securities are collateralized by the transferred receivables from our portfolio  and we receive proceeds from the third party investors in consideration for the loans transferred 
we remove loans from our consolidated balance sheet when securitizations qualify as sales to non consolidated vies  recognize assets retained and liabilities assumed at fair value and record a gain or loss on the transferred loans 
alternatively  when the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing or when the sale is to a consolidated vie  the asset will remain on our consolidated financial statements with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill resulting from business combinations prior to january  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill resulting from business combinations after january   is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree  over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our consolidated balance sheets 
we have elected october as the date to perform our annual goodwill impairment test 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized either on a straight line or on an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
other assets we report our investment in federal home loan bank fhlb stock  which totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively  and our investment in federal reserve stock  which totaled million and million  as of december  and  respectively  in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
we carry these investments at cost and assess for other than temporary impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance for evaluating impairment 
we did not recognize any impairment on these investments in or mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights msrs are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and the right to service these loans is retained for a fee 
subsequently  msrs are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in other income 
in measuring the fair value of our msrs  we stratify the underlying loans based on certain risk characteristics  including loan type  note rate and investor servicing requirements 
we determine the fair value of msrs based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of net servicing income 
we use assumptions in the valuation model that market participants use when estimating future net servicing income  including prepayment speeds  discount rates  default rates  cost to service  escrow account earnings  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income and late fees 
this model is highly sensitive to changes in certain assumptions 
different anticipated prepayment speeds  in particular  can result in substantial changes in the estimated fair value of msrs 
if actual prepayment experience differs from the anticipated rates used in the model  this difference could result in a material change in the value of our msrs 
msrs  which are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our acquisition of chevy chase bank resulted in additional mortgage servicing rights of million as of the acquisition date 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets and note variable interest entities and securitizations for additional information 
upon adoption of the accounting consolidation guidance  certain mortgage loans that had been securitized and accounted for as a sale were subject to consolidation and accounted for as a secured borrowing 
accordingly  effective january   mortgage securitization trusts that contain approximately billion of mortgage loans and related debt securities issued to third party investors were consolidated and the retained interests and 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued mortgage servicing rights related to these newly consolidated trusts were eliminated in consolidation 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information 
fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs 
under the fair value accounting guidance  an entity has the irrevocable option to elect  on a contract by contract basis  to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and thereafter  with any changes in fair value recorded in current earnings 
we did not make any material fair value option elections as of and for the years ended december  and see note fair value of financial instruments for additional information 
representation and warranty reserve in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  our subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan  indemnify the investor or insurer  or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan in the event of a material breach of contractual representations or warranties 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors  depending on the category of purchaser and rely on historical data 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
losses incurred on loans that we are required to either repurchase or make payments to the investor under the indemnification provisions are charged against the reserve 
the representation and warranty reserve is included in other liabilities 
changes to the representation and warranty reserve related to greenpoint are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees for additional information related to our representation and warranty reserve 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued rewards liability we offer products  primarily credit cards  that offer reward program members with various rewards  such as airline tickets  cash  or merchandise  based on account activity 
we generally recognize rewards cost as an offset to interchange income when the rewards are earned by the customer and record the corresponding rewards liability 
the rewards liability is computed based on points earned to date that are expected to be redeemed and the average cost per point redemption 
the rewards liability is reduced as points are redeemed 
in estimating the rewards liability  we consider historical rewards redemption behavior  the terms of the current rewards programs and card purchase activity 
the rewards liability is sensitive to changes in the reward redemption type and redemption rate  which is based on the expectation that the vast majority of all points earned will eventually be redeemed 
the rewards liability  which is included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with applicable accounting standards  all derivative financial instruments  whether designated for hedge accounting or not  are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities 
derivatives in a net asset position are included on in other assets  and derivatives in a net liability position are included in other liabilities 
our policy is not to offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements 
as of december  and  we had recorded million and million  respectively  for the right to retain cash collateral and million and million  respectively  for the obligation to return cash collateral 
the accounting for changes in the fair value ie  gains and losses of a derivative instrument differs based on whether the derivative has been designated as a qualifying accounting hedge and the type of accounting hedge 
for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments we must designate the hedging instrument  based upon the exposure being hedged  as a fair value hedge  a cash flow hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges ie  hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to a particular risk  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in fair values 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges ie  hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item  if any  is recognized in current earnings during the period of change 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation  the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income as part of the cumulative translation adjustment to the extent it is effective 
for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments  the gain or loss is recognized in current earnings during the period of change in the fair value 
we also enter into derivative agreements with our customers to transfer  modify or reduce their interest rate or foreign exchange risks 
as part of this process  we consider the customers suitability for the risk involved  and 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued the business purpose for the transaction 
these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and are considered trading derivatives with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities for additional detail 
revenue recognition we recognize earned finance charges  interest income and fees on loans in interest and non interest income in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements 
as discussed above under loans delinquent and nonperforming loans  interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status  if applicable 
interest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings 
finance charges and fees on credit card loans are included in loan receivables when billed to the customer 
we continue to accrue finance charges and fees on credit card loans until the account is charged off 
however  when we do not expect full payment of billed finance charges and fees  we reduce the balance of our credit card loan receivables by the amount of finance charges billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue 
our methodology for estimating the uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for incurred principal losses on our credit card loan receivables 
revenue was reduced by million  million and billion in  and  respectively  for the estimated uncollectible portion of billed finance charges and fees 
we determine the adequacy of the uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve on a quarterly basis  primarily based on the use of a roll rate methodology 
we refine our estimation process and key assumptions used in determining our loss reserves as additional information becomes available 
in the third quarter of  we revised the manner in which we estimate expected recoveries of finance charge and fee amounts previously considered to be uncollectible 
our revised recovery assumptions better reflect the post recession pattern of relatively low delinquency roll rates combined with increased recoveries of finance charges and fees previously considered uncollectible 
this change in assumptions resulted in reduction in our uncollectible finance charge and fee reserves of million as of september   and in a corresponding increase in revenues 
we also applied these revised assumptions to the estimated recovery of principal charge offs in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses 
the revision  however  had an insignificant impact on the overall determination of our allowance for lease and loan losses 
interchange income is a discount on the payment due from the card issuing bank to the merchant bank through the interchange network 
interchange rates are set by mastercard international inc mastercard and visa usa inc visa and are based on cardholder purchase volumes 
we recognize interchange income as earned 
annual membership fees and direct loan origination costs specific to credit card loans are deferred and amortized over one year on a straight line basis 
fees and origination costs and premiums and discounts are deferred and amortized over the average life of the related loans using the effective interest method for qualifying consumer and commercial loan originations 
direct loan origination costs consist of both internal and external costs associated with the origination of a loan 
marketing expense we expense marketing costs as incurred 
television advertising costs are expensed during the period in which the advertisements are aired 
we recognized marketing expense of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued fraud losses we experience fraud losses from the unauthorized use of credit cards  debit cards and customer bank accounts 
additional fraud losses may be incurred when loans are obtained through fraudulent means 
transactions suspected of being fraudulent are charged to non interest expense after an investigation period 
recoveries of fraud losses also are also included in non interest expense 
see note other non interest expense for additional information 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance for income taxes  recognizing the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized

accounting standards adopted in receivables a creditor s determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for financing receivables  which includes loans  to clarify when a restructuring  such as a loan modification  is considered a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
this amendment provides clarification on determining whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties and whether a concession has been granted to the debtor for purposes of determining if a loan modification constitutes a tdr 
the amended guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june  and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption  with early adoption permitted 
for purposes of measuring impairment for these receivables  the guidance is applied prospectively for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this amended accounting guidance in the third quarter of resulted in a net increase in loan modifications considered to be tdrs of million for consumer loans and million for commercial loans 
the allowance for credit losses associated with these loans was million as of september  fair value measurements and disclosures improving disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance  which amended previous disclosure requirements for fair value measurements  requires new disclosures for significant transfers of financial assets and liabilities into and out of level and level of the fair value hierarchy  and requires that information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward of level activity be presented on a gross basis rather than on a net basis the amended guidance also provides several clarifications with respect to disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring instruments classified as either level or level we adopted the requirement for gross presentation in the level rollforward on january  the remaining provisions of the guidance were effective for us on january  our adoption of the updated guidance did not affect our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity since it amends only the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued recently issued but not yet adopted accounting standards offsetting financial assets and liabilities in december  the fasb issued guidance intended to enhance current disclosure requirements on offsetting financial assets and liabilities 
the new disclosures will enable financial statement users to compare balance sheets prepared under us gaap and ifrs  which are subject to different offsetting models 
upon adoption  entities will be required to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet as well as instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the disclosures will be required irrespective of whether such instruments are presented gross or net on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after january   with comparative retrospective disclosures required for all periods presented 
our adoption of the guidance will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity since it impacts disclosures only 
goodwill impairment in september  the fasb issued guidance that is intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing by providing entities with the option to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative analysis currently required 
if an entity chooses to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting period is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative two step goodwill impairment test is required 
otherwise  goodwill is deemed to be not impaired and no further evaluation analysis would be necessary 
the amended goodwill impairment guidance does not affect the manner in which a company estimates fair value 
the amended guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we intend to adopt the amended guidance on january  we had billion in goodwill as of december   the value of which will not be affected by the adoption of this standard 
presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that revises the manner in which comprehensive income is required to be presented in financial statements 
the new guidance will require companies to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
the guidance eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
it does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income 
the guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we intend to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of our adoption of the guidance will have no effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity since it impacts presentation only 
fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs in may  the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value that is intended to provide a converged fair value framework for us gaap and ifrs 
the amended guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure about fair value between us gaap and ifrs 
while the amended guidance continues to define fair value as an exit price  it changes some fair value measurement 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued principles and expands the existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the amended guidance is effective for public entities during interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption prohibited 
the new guidance requires prospective application and disclosure in the period of adoption of the change  if any  in valuation techniques and related inputs resulting from application of the amendments and quantification of the total effect  if practicable 
we intend to adopt the amended guidance in the first quarter of  and are currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
transfers and servicing reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements in april  the fasb issued an amendment to the guidance for transfers and servicing with regard to repurchase agreements and other agreements that both entitle and obligate a transferor to repurchase or redeem financial assets before their maturity 
this amendment removes the criterion related to collateral maintenance from the transferor s assessment of effective control 
it focuses the assessment of effective control on the transferor s rights and obligations with respect to the transferred financial assets and not whether the transferor has the practical ability to perform in accordance with those rights or obligations 
the amendment is effective prospectively for transactions or modification of existing transactions that occur on or after the first interim or annual period beginning on or after december  we intend to adopt the amended guidance on january  we do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
note acquisitions and restructuring activities we regularly explore opportunities to enter into strategic partnership agreements or acquire financial services companies and businesses to expand our distribution channels and grow our customer base 
we may structure these transactions with both an initial payment and later contingent payments tied to future financial performance 
in some partnership agreements  we may enter into collaborative risk sharing arrangements that provide for revenue and loss sharing 
accounting for acquisitions we account for acquisitions in accordance with the accounting guidance for business combinations 
under the guidance for business combinations  the accounting differs depending on whether the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business 
a business is considered to be an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing economic benefits directly to investors or other owners  members  or participants 
if the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business  the transaction is accounted for as a business combination 
otherwise  it is accounted for as an asset acquisition 
in a business combination  identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date  with limited exceptions 
transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are generally expensed as incurred 
goodwill is recognized as the excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
the operating results of the acquired business are reflected in our consolidated financial statements subsequent to the date of the merger or acquisition 
in an asset acquisition  the assets acquired are recorded at the purchase price plus any transaction costs incurred 
goodwill is not recognized in an asset acquisition 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued accounting for partnership agreements our partnership agreements primarily relate to alliances with third parties to provide lending and other services to private label credit card customers 
we evaluate the specific terms of each agreement to determine whether it meets the definition of a collaborative arrangement and how revenue generated from third parties  costs incurred and transactions between participants in the partnership agreement should be accounted for and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity involving two or more parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the economic success of the activity 
if the agreement involves payments between participants under a revenue or loss sharing arrangement  we must determine whether to report revenue or loss amounts on a gross basis or on a net basis after taking into consideration payments due to or due from participants 
we evaluate the contractual provisions of each transaction and applicable accounting guidance in determining the manner in which to report the impact of revenue and loss sharing amounts in our consolidated balance sheet and the related impact on our allowance for loan and lease losses 
our consolidated net income is the same regardless of whether we record revenue or expense amounts on a gross or net basis 
acquisitions hudson s bay company credit card portfolio on january   in a cash transaction  we acquired the credit card portfolio of hudson s bay company hbc  a canadian operation  from ge capital retail finance 
the acquisition and partnership with hbc significantly expands our credit card customer base in canada  tripling the number of customer accounts  and provides an additional distribution channel 
the acquisition included outstanding credit card loan receivables with a fair value of approximately billion  and a transfer of approximately employees directly involved in managing the hbc portfolio 
we accounted for the acquisition as a business combination 
accordingly  we recorded the assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date and consolidated with our results 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million representing the amount by which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we also recognized a purchased credit card relationship intangible asset of million at acquisition and a contract based intangible asset of million 
because the acquisition was considered to be a taxable transaction  the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes 
the goodwill was assigned to the international credit card reporting unit of our credit card segment  and the acquired loan portfolio is reflected in the operations of our international credit card business 
kohl s credit card portfolio in august  we entered into a private label credit card partnership agreement with kohl s department stores kohl s 
in connection with the partnership agreement  effective april   we acquired kohl s existing private label credit card loan portfolio from jpmorgan chase co 
the existing portfolio  which consists of more than million kohl s customer accounts  had an outstanding principal and interest balance of approximately billion at acquisition 
the partnership agreement has an initial seven year term and an automatic one year renewal thereafter 
we accounted for the purchase as an asset acquisition 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued under the terms of the partnership agreement and in conjunction with the acquisition  we began issuing kohl s branded private label credit cards to new and existing kohl s customers on april  risk management decisions are jointly managed by kohl s and us  but we retain final authority over risk management decisions 
kohl s has primary responsibility for handling customer service functions and advertising and marketing related to credit card customers 
we share a fixed percentage of revenues  consisting of finance charges and late fees  with kohl s  and kohl s is required to reimburse us for a fixed percentage of credit losses incurred 
revenues and losses related to the kohl s credit card program are reported on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements 
the revenue sharing amounts earned by kohl s are reflected as an offset against our revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
the loss sharing amounts from kohl s are reflected as a reduction in our provision for loan and lease losses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also report the related allowance for loan and lease losses attributable to the kohl s portfolio in our consolidated balance sheets net of the loss sharing amount due from kohl s 
interest income was reduced by million for the year ended december   for amounts earned by kohl s 
loss sharing amounts attributable to kohl s reduced charge offs by million in in addition  the expected reimbursement from kohl s netted in our allowance for loan and lease losses was approximately million as of december  the reduction in the provision for loan and lease losses attributable to kohl s was million for the year ended december  restructuring activities in  we completed the broad based initiative started in to reduce expenses and improve our competitive cost position 
restructuring initiatives leveraged the capabilities of infrastructure projects in several of our businesses 
the scope and timing of the cost reductions were the result of an ongoing  comprehensive review of operations within and across our businesses 
total incurred charges exceeded the original estimate of million by million 
the increase occurred because we extended the initiative past the original timeline due to the continued economic deterioration 
approximately half of these charges were related to severance benefits  while the remaining charges were associated with items such as contract and lease terminations and consolidation of facilities and infrastructure 
we recognized restructuring expense of million in we did not recognize any restructuring expense in and note discontinued operations shutdown of mortgage origination operations of wholesale mortgage banking unit in the third quarter of  we closed the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit  acquired by us in december as part of the north fork acquisition

yields of tax exempt securities are calculated on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis 
other than temporary impairment we evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least quarterly  and more often as market conditions require  to assess whether the impairment is other than temporary 
our otti assessment is a subjective process requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
accordingly  we consider a number of qualitative and quantitative criteria in our assessment  including the extent and duration of the impairment  recent events specific to the issuer and or industry to which the issuer belongs  the payment structure of the security  external credit ratings and the failure of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments  the value of underlying collateral  our intent and ability to hold the security  and current market conditions 
we assess measure and recognize otti in accordance with the accounting guidance for recognition and presentation of otti 
under this guidance  if we determine that impairment on our debt securities is other than temporary and we have made the decision to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  we recognize the entire portion of the impairment in earnings 
if we have not made a decision to sell the security and we do not expect that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of the amortized cost basis  we recognize only the credit component of otti in earnings 
the remaining unrealized loss due to factors other than credit  or the non credit component  is recorded in aoci 
we determine the credit component based on the difference between the security s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows  discounted based on the purchase yield 
the non credit component represents the difference between the security s fair value and the present value of expected future cash flows 
the following table summarizes other than temporary impairment losses on debt securities recognized in earnings in  and year ended december  dollars in millions total otti losses less non credit component of otti losses recorded in aoci net otti losses recognized in earnings as indicated in the table above  we recorded credit related losses in earnings totaling million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the cumulative non credit related portion of otti on these securities recorded in aoci totaled million and million in and  respectively 
we estimate the portion of loss attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model  and we estimate the expected cash flows from the underlying collateral using industry standard third party modeling tools 
these tools take into consideration security specific delinquencies  product specific delinquency roll rates and expected severities 
key assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows include default rates  loss severity and prepayment rates 
assumptions used can vary widely based on the collateral underlying the securities and are influenced by factors such as collateral type  loan interest rate  geographical location of the borrower  and borrower characteristics 
we believe the gross unrealized losses related to all other securities of million and million as of december  and  respectively  are attributable to issuer specific credit spreads and changes in market interest rates and asset spreads 
therefore  we currently do not expect to incur credit losses related to these securities 
in addition  we have no intent to sell these securities with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of the amortized cost 
accordingly  we have concluded that the impairment on these securities is not other than temporary

credit quality we closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk 
trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator  among other considerations  of credit risk within our 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued loan portfolios 
the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses 
accordingly  key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates  as well as charge off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance  commercial loans

credit card our credit card loan portfolio is generally highly diversified across millions of accounts and multiple geographies without significant individual exposures 
we therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis 
the risk in our credit card portfolio is correlated with broad economic trends  such as unemployment rates  gross domestic product gdp growth  and home values  as well as customer liquidity  which can have a material effect on credit performance 
the primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge off trends  including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time

consumer banking our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto  home loan and retail banking loans

calculated by dividing net charge offs by average loans held for investment during and home loan our home loan portfolio consists of both first lien and second lien residential mortgage loans 
in evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio  we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on our overall home loan portfolio  such as vintage  geographic concentrations  lien priority and product type 
certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices since the home price peak in and rise in unemployment 
these loan concentrations include loans originated during  and in an environment of decreasing home sales  broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards and loans on properties in arizona  california  florida and nevada  which have experienced the most severe decline in home prices

commercial banking we evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans individually and use a risk rating system to determine the credit quality of our commercial loans 
we assign internal risk grades to loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt 
in determining the risk rating of a particular loan  among the factors considered are the borrower s current financial condition  historical credit performance  projected future credit performance  prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors  the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends 
the ratings scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows noncriticized loans that have not been designated as criticized  frequently referred to as pass loans 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued criticized performing loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed  affecting earnings  cash flows or collateral values 
the borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near term obligations  however  the stress  left unabated  my result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date 
criticized nonperforming loans that are not adequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well defined weakness  or weaknesses  which jeopardize the repayment of the debt 
these loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
we use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting  determining the frequency of review of the credit exposures and evaluation and determination of the allowance for commercial loans 
loans of million or more designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified graded and whether impairment exists 
all other loans greater than million are specifically reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriate loan grading 
in addition  during the renewal process of any loan  as well if a loan becomes past due  we evaluate the risk rating

these loans consisted of chevy chase bank s entire portfolio of option adjustable rate mortgage loans  hybrid adjustable rate mortgage loans and construction to permanent mortgage loans

changes in accretable yield of acquired loans subsequent to acquisition  we are required to periodically evaluate our estimate of cash flows expected to be collected 
these evaluations  performed quarterly  require the continued use of key assumptions and estimates  similar to the initial estimate of fair value 
subsequent changes in the estimated cash flows expected to be collected may result in changes in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassifications from nonaccretable yield to accretable 
increases in the cash flows expected to be collected will generally result in an increase in interest income over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loans 
decreases in expected cash flows due to further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for loan and lease losses  resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan losses 
we reduced the allowance related to this pool of loans by million for the year ended december  we recorded impairment through our provision for loan and losses of million for the year ended december  the cumulative impairment recognized on pci loans totaled million as of december  and million as of december  the following table presents changes in the accretable yield related to the acquired chevy chase bank loans dollars in millions total acquired loans purchased credit impaired loans non impaired loans accretable yield as of december  accretion recognized in earnings reclassifications from nonaccretable difference for loans with improvement in expected cash flows accretable yield as of december  accretion recognized in earnings reclassifications from nonaccretable difference for loans with improving cash flows reductions in accretable yield for non credit related changes in expected cash flows accretable yield as of december  represents increases in accretable yields for those pools with increases primarily the result of improved credit performance

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued unfunded lending commitments we manage the potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements  both by individual customer and in total  by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities 
unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
while these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines  we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time 
in addition to available unused credit card lines  we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards 
collateral requirements and loan to value ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
these commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
the outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines were approximately billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
we maintain a reserve for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to absorb estimated probable losses related to these unfunded credit facilities in other liabilities  on our consolidated balance sheets 
our reserve for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit was million and million as december  and  respectively

note allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance that represents management s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date 
we do not maintain an allowance for held for sale loans or purchased credit impaired loans that are performing in accordance with or better than our expectations as of the date of acquisition  as the fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component 
in determining the allowance for loan and lease losses  we disaggregate loans in our portfolio with similar credit risk characteristics into portfolio segments 
management performs quarterly analysis of these portfolios to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting credit losses 
we apply documented systematic methodologies to separately calculate the allowance for our consumer loan and commercial loan portfolio and for loans within each of these portfolios that we identify as individually impaired 
our allowance for loan and lease losses consists of three components that are allocated to cover the estimated probable losses in each loan portfolio based on the results of our detailed review and loan impairment assessment process a formula based component for loans collectively evaluated for impairment  an asset specific component for individually impaired loans  and a component related to purchased credit impaired loans that have experienced significant decreases in expected cash flows subsequent to acquisition

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued note variable interest entities and securitizations in the normal course of business  we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be variable interest entities vies 
historically  our primary involvement with vies related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts 
these securitization trusts typically meet the definition of a vie 
we generally securitized credit card loans  auto loans  home loans and installment loans  which provided a source of funding for us and as a means of transferring a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties 
under revised consolidation accounting guidance that became effective on january   the entity that has a controlling financial interest in a vie is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie 
as a result of this guidance  the vast majority of the vies in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements 
summary of consolidated and unconsolidated vies the table below presents a summary of vies  aggregated based on vies with similar characteristics  in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of december  and we separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated vies 
for consolidated vies  we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
the assets of consolidated vies primarily consist of cash and loans  which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors and restricted loans for securitization investors  respectively 
the assets of a particular vie are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations 
the creditors of the vies typically do not have recourse to the general credit of our company 
the liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the vies  which we report under securitized debt obligations 
for unconsolidated vies  we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss

mortgage servicing rights related to unconsolidated vies are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under other assets 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets for additional information on our mortgage servicing rights 
the carrying amount of liabilities of securitization related vies is comprised of obligations to fund negative amortization bonds associated with the securitization of option arm mortgage loans option arms and obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitization of manufactured housing loans 
the maximum exposure to loss represents the amount of loss we would incur in the unlikely event that all of our assets in the vie become worthless and we were required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations 
represents the gross assets and liabilities owned by the vie which included seller s interest and retained and repurchased notes held by other related parties 
securitization related vies we historically have securitized credit card loans  auto loans  home loans and installment loans 
in a securitization transaction  assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish  which typically meets the definition of a vie 
the trust then issues various forms of interests in those assets to investors 
we typically receive cash proceeds and or other interests in the securitization trust for the assets we transfer 
if the transfer of the assets to an unconsolidated securitization trust qualifies as a sale  we remove the assets from our consolidated balance sheet and recognize a gain or loss on the transfer 
alternatively  if the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing or the transfer of assets is to a consolidated vie  the assets remain on our consolidated financial statements and we record an offsetting liability for the proceeds received 
our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer 
we also may be required to repurchase receivables from the trust if the outstanding balance of the receivables falls to a level where the cost exceeds the benefits of servicing such receivables 
we also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties 
see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees for information related to reserves we have established for our potential mortgage representation and warranty exposure

the manufactured housing securitizations are serviced by a third party 
for two of the deals  that third party works in the capacity of subservicer with capital one being the master servicer 
amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics such as charge off rates or delinquency rates below certain predetermined thresholds 
generally  the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust related cash flows to the benefit of senior noteholders 
non mortgage securitizations as of december  and  we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of all of our non mortgage securitization trusts 
accordingly  all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements 
mortgage securitizations option arm loans we had previously securitized option arm mortgage loans by transferring the mortgage loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage backed securities to investors 
the outstanding balance of debt securities held by third party investors related to our mortgage loan securitization trusts at december  and was billion and billion  respectively 
we continue to service some of the outstanding balance of securitized mortgage receivables 
we also retain rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables  the most significant being certificated interest only bonds issued by the trusts  certain of which we sold during the year ended december  we generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows from securitized and sold receivables  using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses  
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
we do not consolidate these trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts 
in connection with the securitization of certain option arm loans  a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any negative amortization resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period 
we have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement 
the amount advanced is tracked through mortgage backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction 
as the borrowers make principal payments  these securities receive their net pro rata portion of those payments in cash  and advances of negative amortization are refunded accordingly 
as advances occur  we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds  which are held at fair value in other assets 
we have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities 
these are classified as free standing derivatives  with fair value adjustments recorded in non interest income 
see note derivative instruments and hedging activities for further details on these derivatives 
greenpoint mortgage helocs our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit  greenpoint  previously sold home equity lines of credit in whole loan sales and subsequently acquired a residual interest in certain trusts which securitized some of those loans 
as the residual interest holder  greenpoint is required to fund advances on the home equity lines of credit when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance 
we had funded million in advances through december   all of which was expensed as funded 
our unfunded commitment related to these residual interests was million as of december  we have not consolidated these trusts because the residual certificates did not provide the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the trusts 
greenpoint mortgage manufactured housing we retain the primary obligation for certain provisions of corporate guarantees  recourse sales and clean up calls related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of greenpoint credit llc gpc which was sold to a third party in although we are the primary obligor  recourse obligations related to former gpc whole loan sales  commitments to exercise mandatory clean up calls on certain gpc securitization transactions and servicing were transferred to a third party in the sale transaction 
we do not consolidate the trusts used for the securitization of manufactured housing loans because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts since we no longer service the loans 
we were required to fund letters of credit in to cover losses  and are obligated to fund future amounts under swap agreements for certain transactions 
we have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released 
the amount available under the letters of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the expected residual balances on the funded letters of credit was million and million at december  and  respectively  and is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
our maximum exposure under the swap agreements was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the value of our obligations under these swaps was million and million at december  and  respectively and is recorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
in the event the third party does not fulfill on its obligations to exercise the clean up calls on certain transactions  the obligation 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued reverts to us and we would assume approximately million of loans receivable upon our execution of the clean up call with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loans receivable 
there have been no instances of non performance to date by the third party 
we monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and reviews the purchaser s financial strength as well as servicing performance 
these factors are considered in assessing the adequacy of the liabilities established for these obligations and the valuations of the assets 
retained interests in unconsolidated securitizations accounts receivable from securitizations retained interests in unconsolidated securitizations are included in accounts receivable from securitizations on our consolidated balance sheets 
these retained interests consist of interest only strips  retained tranches  cash collateral accounts  cash reserve accounts and unpaid interest and fees on the third party investors portion of the transferred principal receivables

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued the changes in the fair value of retained interests are primarily driven by rate assumption changes and volume fluctuations 
all of these retained residual interests are subject to loss in the event assumptions used to determine the estimated fair value do not prevail  or if borrowers default on the related securitized receivables and our retained subordinated tranches are used to repay investors 
see the table below for key assumptions and sensitivities for retained interest valuations 
key assumptions and sensitivities for retained interest valuations the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of the interest only strip and other retained residual interests include the weighted average ranges for principal payment rates  lives of receivables and discount rates  all of which are included in the following table 
the principal repayment rate assumptions were determined using actual and forecast trust principal payment rates based on the collateral 
the lives of receivables were determined as the number of months necessary to repay the investors given the principal payment rate assumptions 
the discount rates were determined using primarily trust specific statistics and forward rate curves  and were reflective of what market participants would use in a similar valuation 
additionally  accrued interest receivable  cash reserve and spread accounts were discounted over the estimated life of the assets 
if these assumptions are not met  or if they change  the interest only strip  retained interests and related servicing and securitizations income would be affected 
the following adverse changes to the key assumptions and estimates are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  any change in fair value based on a or variation in assumptions cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of a change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the interest only strip is calculated independently from any change in another assumption 
however  changes in one factor may result in changes in other factors  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
for the periods ending december  and  the assumptions and sensitivities shown below include all off balance sheet securitizations december  dollars in millions interest only strip retained interests weighted average life for receivables months principal repayment rate weighted average rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate weighted average rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change does not include liquidity swap related to the negative amortization bonds of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
static pool credit losses were calculated by summing the actual and projected future credit losses and dividing them by the original balance of each pool of assets 
due to the short term revolving nature of the loan receivables  the weighted average percentage of static pool credit losses was not considered materially different from the assumed charge off rates used to determine the fair value of the retained interests

impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if events or circumstances change  such as adverse changes in the business climate  that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
goodwill is assigned to one or more reporting units at the date of acquisition 
our reporting units are domestic credit card  international credit card  auto finance  other consumer banking and commercial banking 
as of december  and  goodwill of billion was included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
there were no events requiring an interim impairment test and there has been no goodwill impairment recorded for the year ended december  the goodwill impairment test  performed at october of each year  is a two step test 
the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
for the annual impairment test  the fair value of reporting units was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis  a form of the income approach  using each reporting unit s internal forecast and a terminal value calculated using a growth rate reflecting the nominal growth rate of the economy as a whole and appropriate discount rates for the respective reporting units 
cash flows were adjusted as necessary in order to maintain each reporting unit s equity capital requirements 
our discounted cash flow analysis required management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth  revenue growth  credit losses  and capital rates 
the cash flows were discounted to present value using reporting unit specific discount rates that are largely based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for risk inherent in each reporting unit 
discount rates used for the reporting units 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued ranged from to 
the key inputs into the discounted cash flow analysis were corroborated with market data  where available  indicating that assumptions used were within a reasonable range of observable market data 
based on the comparison of fair value to carrying amount  as calculated using the methodology summarized above  fair value exceeded the carrying amount for all reporting units as of our annual testing date 
therefore  the goodwill of our reporting units was considered not impaired  and the second step of impairment testing was unnecessary 
as part of the annual goodwill impairment test  we assessed our market capitalization based on the average market price relative to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units and determined that any excess fair value in our reporting units at that time could be attributed to a reasonable control premium compared to historical control premiums seen in the industry 
continued market volatility and uncertainty regarding overall economic conditions have led to a decline in market capitalization in recent years resulting in significantly higher control premiums than what had been seen historically 
we will continue to regularly monitor our market capitalization in  overall economic conditions and other events or circumstances that may result in an impairment of goodwill in the future

note derivative instruments and hedging activities use of derivatives we manage our asset liability position and market risk exposure in accordance with prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our asset liability management committee and approved by our board of directors 
our primary market risk stems from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates  and to a lesser extent  changes in foreign exchange rates 
we manage our interest rate sensitivity through several approaches  which include  but are not limited to  changing the maturity and re pricing characteristics of various balance sheet categories and by entering into interest rate derivatives 
derivatives are also utilized to manage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates 
derivative instruments may be privately negotiated contracts  which are often referred to as over the counter otc derivatives  or they may be listed and traded on an exchange 
we execute our derivative contracts in both the otc and exchange traded derivative markets 
in addition to interest rate swaps  we use a variety of other derivative instruments  including caps  floors  options  futures and forward contracts  to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
on a regular basis  we enter into customer accommodation derivative transactions 
we engage in these transactions as a service to our commercial banking customers to facilitate their risk management objectives 
we typically offset the market risk exposure to our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued accounting for derivatives we account for derivatives pursuant to the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
the outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  the notional amount provides an indication of the volume of our derivatives activity and is used as the basis on which interest and other payments are determined  however  it is generally not the amount exchanged 
derivatives are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of a derivative represents our estimate of the amount at which a derivative could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we report derivatives in a gain position  or derivative assets  in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other assets 
we report derivatives in a loss position  or derivative liabilities  in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
we report derivative asset and liability amounts on a gross basis based on individual contracts  which does not take into consideration the effects of master counterparty netting agreements or collateral netting 
the fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets was billion and million  respectively  as of december   compared with billion and million  respectively  as of december  our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free standing derivatives 
free standing derivatives consist of customer accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that we enter into for risk management purposes that are not linked to specific assets or liabilities or to forecasted transactions and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges  cash flow hedges or net investment hedges 
fair value hedges we designate derivatives as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities  which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates 
changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness 
our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed rate senior notes  subordinated notes  securitization debt  brokered certificates of deposits and us agency investments 
these hedges have maturities through and have the effect of converting some of our fixed rate debt  deposits and investments to variable rate 
cash flow hedges we designate derivatives as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions 
changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of aoci  to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective  and amounts are reclassified from aoci to earnings as the forecasted transactions occur 
to the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships  the amounts are recorded in current period earnings 
our cash flow hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to hedge the variability in interest payments on some of our variable rate debt issuances and assets through these hedges have the effect of converting some of our variable rate debt and assets to a fixed rate 
we also have entered into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated debt 
net investment hedges we use net investment hedges  primarily forward foreign exchange contracts  to manage the exposure related to our net investments in consolidated foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of aoci 
during the third quarter of  we discontinued hedge accounting on our only net investment hedge 
therefore  we did not have any net investment hedges outstanding as of december  free standing derivatives we use free standing derivatives  or economic hedges  to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential msrs  mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and

we recorded a net cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our derivative positions of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
see derivative counterparty credit risk below for additional information 
customer accommodation derivatives include those entered into with our commercial banking customers and those entered into with other counterparties to offset the market risk 
in june  we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with ing groep nv  ing bank nv  ing direct nv  and ing direct bancorp collectively  the ing sellers under which we would acquire substantially all of the ing sellers ing direct business in the united states ing direct 
we took several actions during the year to manage the anticipated impact of the ing direct acquisition on our market risk exposure and regulatory capital requirements 
from the date we entered into the agreement to acquire ing direct to early august  interest rates declined substantially  which resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of the ing direct net assets and liabilities 
in order to capture some of the anticipated benefits to regulatory capital on the closing date attributable to this decline in interest rates  in early august  we entered into various interest rate swap transactions with a total notional principal amount of approximately billion 
we subsequently rebalanced the hedge in october adding an additional billion in notional principal for a total combined notional principal amount of approximately billion 
these combined swap transactions were intended to mitigate the effect of a rise in interest rates on the fair values of a significant portion of the ing direct assets and liabilities during the period from when we entered into the swap transactions to the anticipated closing date of the ing direct acquisition in early although the interest rate swaps represented economic hedges  they were not designated for hedge accounting under us gaap 
therefore  we recorded changes in the fair value of these interest swaps in earnings 
in  we recorded a mark to market loss of million related to these interest rate swaps  which was attributable to the decline in interest rates 
in conjunction with the acquisition of ing direct on february   we terminated the billion in interest rate swaps related to the acquisition 
we continued to record changes in the fair value of these interest rate swaps in earnings until the swaps were terminated in february

the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was six years as of december  the amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy

credit risk related contingency features certain of our derivative contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies 
in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade  some of our derivative counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions 
other derivative contracts include provisions that would  in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade  allow our derivative counterparties to demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position 
certain of our derivative contracts may allow  in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind  our derivative counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivative instruments in a net liability position

if our debt credit rating had fallen below investment grade  we would have been required to post additional collateral of million as of december  and derivative counterparty credit risk derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the contractual terms of the contract 
our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position  or derivative assets  assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral 
to mitigate the risk of counterparty default  we maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties 
these agreements typically require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds 
we received cash collateral from derivatives counterparties totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we posted cash collateral in accounts maintained by derivatives counterparties totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty 
we consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment  which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contract  collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty 
the cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative asset balance was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our credit quality

as a result of the completion of the audit  the amount of the company s unrecognized tax benefits increased by million 
on february   the company finalized a closing agreement with the irs that resolved certain outstanding issues for the tax years through that were unresolved by the april  decision by the us tax court in the company s federal tax litigation for the tax years this agreement did not impact the company s unrecognized tax benefits 
on october   the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit entered an unfavorable decision on the two issues that the company had appealed from the tax court s decision 
as a result of the decision  the company reduced the amount of unrecognized tax benefits with respect to these issues by approximately million 
it is reasonably possible that further settlements related to the company s unrecognized tax benefits may be made within twelve months of the reporting date 
at this time  an estimate of the potential change to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits resulting from such settlements cannot be made 
as of december   us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the us  in accordance with the guidance for accounting for income taxes in special areas 
these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely 
upon repatriation of these earnings  we could be subject to both us income taxes subject to possible adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability and foreign withholding tax on these unremitted earnings is not practicable at this time because such liability is dependent upon circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs

note fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
the fair value accounting guidance provides a three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments 
this hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable 
fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued the accounting guidance for fair value requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value 
the accounting guidance for derivatives also provides for the irrevocable option to elect  on a contract by contract basis  to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value into earnings 
we had not made any material fair value option elections as of december  and level  and valuation techniques financial instruments are considered level when the valuation can be based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
financial instruments are considered level when their values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques  and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation

see note variable interest entities and securitizations for additional information 
the determination of the classification of financial instruments in level or level of the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period 
we consider all available information  including observable market data  indications of market liquidity and orderliness  and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs 
based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  judgments are made regarding the significance of the level inputs to the instruments fair value measurement in its entirety 
if level inputs are considered significant  the instrument is classified as level the process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions

the transfers out of level for the years ended december  and was primarily driven by greater consistency amongst multiple pricing sources 
the transfers into level was primarily driven by less consistency amongst vendor pricing on individual securities for non agency mbs 
the amount presented for unrealized gains loss for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments for available for sale securities  accretion on certain fixed maturity securities  and change in fair value of derivative instruments 
the impairments are reported in total other than temporary losses as a component of non interest income 
assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis we are required to measure and recognize certain other financial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet

the provisions requiring us to maximize the use of observable inputs and to measure fair value using a notion of exit price were factored into our selection of inputs of our established valuation techniques 
financial assets cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold and resale agreements and interest bearing deposits at other banks approximate fair value 
restricted cash or securitization investors the carrying amounts of restricted cash for securitization investors approximate their fair value due to their relatively short term nature 
securities available for sale quoted prices in active markets are used to measure the fair value of us treasury securities 
for other investment categories  we utilize multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for the large majority of our securities 
a pricing service may be considered as the primary pricing provider for certain types of securities  and the designation of the primary pricing provider may vary depending on the type of securities 
the determination of the primary pricing provider is based on our experience and validation benchmark of the pricing service s performance in terms of providing fair value measurement for the various types of securities 
certain securities available for sale are classified as level and  the majority of which are collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage backed securities 
classification indicates that significant valuation assumptions are not consistently observable in the market 
when significant assumptions are not consistently observable  fair values are derived using the best available data 
such data may include quotes provided by a dealer  the use of external pricing services  independent pricing models  or other model based valuation techniques such as calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields  spreads  prepayment speeds  credit ratings  and losses 
the techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available 
pricing models may be used  which can vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade  bid and other market information 
across asset classes  information such as trader dealer input  credit spreads  forward curves  and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations 
because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis  the evaluated pricing applications may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves  like securities  sector groupings  and matrix pricing to prepare valuations 
in addition  model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
we validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources  including other pricing services  dealer pricing indications in transaction results  and other internal sources 
pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated 
as of december   we saw further improvements in the market value of our portfolio holdings driven by lower interest rates and reduced risk premiums as compared to the decrease in the amount of level securities reflected continued run off or liquidation of the securities and improvement in pricing consistency

the fair value of loans held for sale is determined using current secondary market prices for portfolios with similar characteristics 
the carrying amounts as of december  and approximate fair value 
loans held for investment  net the fair values of credit card loans  installment loans  auto loans  home loans and commercial loans were estimated using a discounted cash flow method  a form of the income approach 
discount rates were determined considering rates at which similar portfolios of loans would be made under current conditions and considering liquidity spreads applicable to each loan portfolio based on the secondary market 
the fair value of credit card loans excluded any value related to customer account relationships 
the increase in fair value above carrying amount at december  was primarily due to a tightening of liquidity spreads and improved credit performance noted in our credit card  auto and commercial loan portfolios 
interest receivable the carrying amount of interest receivable approximates the fair value of this asset due to its relatively short term nature 
accounts receivable from securitizations accounts receivable from securitizations include the interest only strip  retained notes accrued interest receivable  cash reserve accounts and cash spread accounts for those securitization structures achieving off balance sheet treatment 
refer to note variable interest entities and securitizations for discussion regarding the adoption of the new accounting consolidation standards on january  we use a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the model incorporates our estimate of assumptions market participants use in determining fair value  including estimates of payment rates  defaults  and discount rates including adjustments for liquidity  and contractual interest and fees 
other retained interests related to securitizations are carried at cost  which approximates fair value 
the valuation technique for these securities is discussed in more detail in note variable interest entities and securitizations 
derivative assets most of our derivatives are not exchange traded  but instead traded in over the counter markets where quoted market prices are not readily available 
the fair value derived for those derivatives using models that use primarily market observable inputs  such as interest rate yield curves  credit curves  option volatility and currency rates are classified as level any derivative fair value measurements using significant assumptions that are unobservable are classified as level  which include interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves 
the impact of counterparty non performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative assets 
these derivatives are included in other assets on the balance sheet 
we validate the pricing obtained from the internal models through comparison of pricing to additional sources  including external valuation agents and other internal sources 
pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued mortgage servicing rights msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices 
accordingly  we determine the fair value of msrs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income 
the model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income  including estimates of prepayment spreads  discount rate  cost to service  contractual servicing fee income  ancillary income and late fees 
we record msrs at fair value on a recurring basis 
fair value measurements of msrs use significant unobservable inputs and  accordingly  are classified as level the valuation technique for these securities is discussed in more detail in note goodwill and other intangible assets 
financial liabilities interest bearing deposits the fair value of other interest bearing deposits was determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for similar products with similar remaining terms 
non interest bearing deposits the carrying amount of non interest bearing deposits approximates fair value 
senior and subordinated notes we engage multiple third party pricing services in order to estimate the fair value of senior and subordinated notes 
the pricing service utilizes a pricing model that incorporates available trade  bid and other market information 
it also incorporates spread assumptions  volatility assumptions and relevant credit information into the pricing models 
securitized debt obligations we utilized multiple third party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for the large majority of our securitized debt obligations 
the techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available  and pricing models may be used which incorporate available trade  bid and other market information as described in the above section 
we used internal pricing models  discounted cash flow models or similar techniques to estimate the fair value of certain securitization trusts where third party pricing was not available 
other borrowings the carrying amount of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  fhlb advances  and other short term borrowings approximates fair value 
the fair value of junior subordinated borrowings was estimated using the same methodology as described for senior and subordinated notes 
the fair value of other borrowings was determined based on trade information for bonds with similar duration and credit quality  adjusted to incorporate any relevant credit information of the issuer 
the increase in fair value of other borrowings above carrying values at december  was primarily due to interest rate spreads across the industry 
interest payable the carrying amount of interest payable approximates the fair value of this liability due to its relatively short term nature

the estimated fair values of extensions of credit and letters of credit are not readily available 
however  the fair value of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with comparable credit risks and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties 
commitments to extend credit issued by us are generally short term in nature and  if drawn upon  are issued under current market terms and conditions for credits with comparable risks 
at december  and  there was no material unrealized appreciation or depreciation on these financial instruments

accordingly  net gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities are included in the other category 
the other category also includes foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to the revaluation of foreign currency denominated investments  certain gains losses on the sale and securitization of loans  unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance  such as acquisition and restructuring charges  provisions for representation and warranty reserves related to continuing operations  certain material items that are non recurring in nature  and offsets related to certain line item reclassifications 
basis of presentation we report the financial results of our business segments on a continuing operations basis 
see note discontinued operations for a discussion of discontinued operations 
the results of our individual businesses  which are prepared on an internal management accounting and reporting basis  reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources 
we refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our managed presentation  which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on us gaap 
there is no comprehensive  authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to us gaap  therefore  the managed basis presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies 
in addition  our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with us gaap 
prior to january   our managed basis presentation assumed that our securitized loans had not been sold and that the earnings from securitized loans were classified in our results of operations in the same manner as the earnings on loans that we owned 
our managed results also reflected differences in accounting for the valuation of retained interests and the recognition of gains and losses on the sale of interest only strips 
our managed results did not include the addition of an allowance for loan and lease losses for the loans underlying our off balance sheet securitization trusts 
the adoption on january  of the new consolidation accounting standards resulted in accounting for the loans in our securitization trusts in our reported financial statements in a manner similar to how we account for these loans on a managed basis 
as a result  our total reported and managed basis presentations are generally comparable for periods beginning after january  we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment 
business segment reporting methodology the results of our business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business 
we have developed allocation methods for use in our internal management accounting and reporting process to assign certain managed balance sheet assets  deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment 
these allocation methods include funds transfer pricing and various other internally developed methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of each business segment 
due to the integrated nature of our business segments  estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items 
transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third party rates 
we regularly assess the assumptions  methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting  which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued following is a description of the principles and methodologies used in preparing our business segment results 
net interest income interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense from deposits and other interest bearing liabilities are reflected within each applicable business segment 
because funding and asset liability management are managed centrally by our corporate treasury group  net interest income for our business segments also includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that is intended to allocate a cost of funds used or credit for funds provided to all business segment assets and liabilities  respectively  using a matched funding concept 
also  taxable equivalent benefit of tax exempt products is allocated to each business unit with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
non interest income non interest fees and other revenue associated with loans or customers managed by each business segment and other direct revenues are accounted for within each business segment 
provision for loan and lease losses the provisions for loan and lease losses are directly attributable to the business segment in which the loans are managed 
non interest expense non interest expenses directly managed and incurred by a business segment are accounted for within each business segment 
we allocate certain non interest expenses indirectly incurred by business segments  such as corporate support functions  to each business segment based on various factors  including the actual cost of the services from the service providers  the utilization of the services  the number of employees or other relevant factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are assigned to business segments based on the relative fair value of each segment 
intangible amortization is included in the results of the applicable segment 
income taxes income taxes are assessed for each business segment based on a standard tax rate with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in the other category 
loans held for investment loans are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type 
deposits deposits are reported within each business segment based on product or customer type 
segment results and reconciliation the following tables provide a summary of our business segment results for the years ended december   and and selected balance sheet data as of december  and total consolidated assets are not allocated among our business segments in the information that is reviewed by our chief operating decision maker 
the total of our business segment results and other category  or total managed  differs from our total consolidated reported results 
the impact of these differences is reflected in the reconciliation category 
the securitization adjustments remove the impact of presenting off balance sheet securitized loans in our business segment results in the same manner as on balance sheet loans to reconcile to our total consolidated reported results 
we may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued note commitments  contingencies and guarantees letters of credit we issue letters of credit financial standby  performance standby and commercial to meet the financing needs of our customers 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement 
commercial letters of credit are short term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client 
collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and customer acceptances  and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses 
we had contractual amounts of standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit of billion at december  as of december   financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from to the fair value of the guarantees outstanding which we included in our consolidated balance sheets in other liabilities was million as of december  contingent payments related to acquisitions and partnership agreements certain of our acquisition and partnership agreements include contingent payment provisions in which we agree to provide future payments  up to a maximum amount  based on certain performance criteria 
our contingent payment arrangements are generally based on the difference between the expected credit performance of specified loan portfolios as of the date of the applicable agreement and the actual future performance 
to the extent that actual losses associated with these portfolios are less than the expected level  we agree to share a portion of the benefit with the seller 
the maximum contingent payment amount related to our acquisitions totaled million as of december  the actual payment amount related to million of this balance will be determined as of september  the actual payment amount related to the remaining million of this balance will be determined as of december  we recognized an expense related to contingent payment arrangements of million in the second quarter of  million in the third quarter of  and a reduction to expense of million in the fourth quarter of as such  we recognized a cumulative expense of million in related to contingent payment arrangements 
we had a liability for contingent payments related to these arrangements of million as of december  we did not record a liability related to these arrangements as of december  based on our expectation of credit losses on the portfolios 
potential mortgage representation warranty liabilities in recent years  we acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold them to various purchasers  including purchasers who created securitization trusts 
these subsidiaries are capital one home loans  which was acquired in february  greenpoint mortgage funding  inc greenpoint  which was acquired in december as part of the north fork acquisition  and chevy chase bank  which was acquired in february and subsequently merged into cona 
in connection with their sales of mortgage loans  the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about  among other things  the ownership of the loan  the validity of the lien securing the loan  the loan s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser  including underwriting guidelines and the ongoing existence of mortgage insurance  and the loan s compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
the representations and warranties do not address the credit performance 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued of the mortgage loans  but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty 
each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties 
in the event of a repurchase  the subsidiary is typically required to pay the then unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses including  in certain cases  legal costs incurred by the purchaser and or others 
the subsidiary then recovers the loan or  if the loan has been foreclosed  the underlying collateral 
the subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral 
in some instances  rather than repurchase the loans  a subsidiary may agree to make a cash payment to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims 
in addition  our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties 
in some cases  the amount of such losses could exceed the repurchase amount of the related loans 
these subsidiaries  in total  originated and sold to non affiliates approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between and  which are the years or vintages with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims 
the following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations  by vintage for through  for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the outstanding principal balance as of december  and unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to third parties based on category of purchaser unpaid principal balance december  original unpaid principal balance dollars in billions total government sponsored enterprises gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total gses include fannie mae and freddie mac 
between and  our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the gses 
of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance insured securitizations  approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries active insured securitizations  and the remaining approximately billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries inactive insured securitizations 
insured securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors 
bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers  and they often have super majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others  we do not have complete information about the current ownership of the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to gses or placed in insured securitizations 
we have determined based on information obtained from third party databases that about billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans are currently held by private label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance uninsured securitizations 
in contrast with the bond insurers in insured securitizations  investors in uninsured securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can direct a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases  including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes 
an additional approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans 
of this amount  we believe approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were ultimately purchased by gses 
for purposes of our reserves setting process  we consider these loans to be private label loans rather than gse loans 
various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in this category 
with respect to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between and  we estimate that approximately billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of december   approximately billion in losses have been realized and approximately billion in unpaid principal balance is at least days delinquent 
because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others  we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans 
these amounts reflect our best estimates  including extrapolations where necessary 
these extrapolations occur on the approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans for which we do not have complete information about the current holders or the underlying credit performance 
these estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis 
the subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of december   compared with billion as of december  as of december   the majority of new repurchase demands received over the last year and  as discussed below  the majority of our million reserve relates to the billion of original principal balance of mortgage loans originally sold to the gses or to active insured securitizations 
currently  repurchase demands predominantly relate to the and vintages 
we have received relatively few repurchase demands from the and vintages  mostly because greenpoint ceased originating mortgages in august the following table presents information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request 
the amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances 

table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued open pipeline all vintages all entities dollars in millions all amounts are original principal balance gses insured securitizations uninsured securitizations and other total open claims as of december  gross new demands received loans repurchased made whole demands rescinded open claims as of december  gross new demands received loans repurchased made whole demands rescinded reclassifications open claims as of december  the open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses 
accordingly  repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline 
moreover  repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue repurchase requests are included within the open pipeline unless the requesting party has formally rescinded its repurchase request 
finally  the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans 
activity in relates to repurchase demands from all years 
represents adjustments to correct the counterparty category as of december  for amounts that were misclassified 
the reclassification had no impact on the total pending repurchase requests  however  it resulted in an increase in open claims attributable to gses and insured securitizations and a decrease in open claims attributable to uninsured securitizations and other 
we have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable  including both litigation and non litigation liabilities 
these reserves are reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities 
the reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates  which are inherently uncertain  and requires the application of judgment 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis 
we build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for repurchase losses  which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non interest income for loans originated and sold by chevy chase bank and capital one home loans and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by greenpoint 
in establishing the representation and warranty reserves  we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser 
in establishing reserves for the billion original principal balance of gse loans  we rely on the historical relationship between gse loan losses and repurchase outcomes to estimate the percentage of current and future gse loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the gses over the lifetime of the gse loans  and the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases 
we also rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on gse loans 
this reserving approach to the gse loans reflects the historical interaction with the gses around repurchase requests  and also includes anticipated repurchases resulting from mortgage insurance rescissions 
the gses typically have stronger contractual rights than non gse counterparties because gse 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued contracts typically do not contain prompt notice requirements for repurchase requests or materiality qualifications to the representations and warranties 
moreover  although we often disagree with the gses about the validity of their repurchase requests  we have established a negotiation pattern whereby the gses and our subsidiaries continually negotiate around individual repurchase requests  leading to the gses rescinding some repurchase requests and our subsidiaries agreeing in some cases to repurchase some loans or make the gses whole with respect to losses 
our lifetime representation and warranty reserves with respect to gse loans are grounded in this history 
for the billion original principal balance in active insured securitizations  our reserving approach also reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests 
typically  monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the active insured securitization category 
in response to these repurchase requests  our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements around a valid repurchase request have been satisfied 
in response to these requests for supporting documentation  monoline bond insurers typically initiate litigation 
accordingly  our reserves within the active insured securitization are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers  but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers 
every bond insurer within this category is pursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation 
accordingly  our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves 
in establishing litigation reserves for this category  we consider current and future losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization 
our estimated legal liability for each securitization within this category assumes that we will be responsible for only a portion of the losses inherent in each securitization 
our litigation reserves with respect to both the us bank litigation and the dbsp litigation  in each case as referenced below  are contained within the active insured securitization reserve category 
further  our litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third party securitizations sponsors  where greenpoint provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation  are also contained within this category 
for the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the inactive insured securitizations category and the billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the uninsured securitizations and other whole loan sales categories  we establish reserves by relying on our historical activity and repurchase rates to estimate repurchase liabilities over the next twelve months 
we do not believe we can estimate repurchase liability for these categories for a period longer than twelve months because of the relatively irregular nature of repurchase activity within these categories 
some uninsured securitization investors from this category who have not made repurchase requests or filed representation and warranty lawsuits are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and or state securities laws 
although we face some direct and indirect indemnity risks from these litigations  we have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities 
the aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries were million as of december   as compared with million as of december  we recorded a total provision for repurchase losses for our representation and warranty repurchase exposure of million for the year ended december   primarily driven by increased repurchase activity from uninsured securitizations and other whole loan investors 
during  we had settlements of repurchase requests totaling million that were charged against the reserve 
the table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves for the years ended december  and

the pre tax portion of the provision for mortgage repurchase claims recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations totaled million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as indicated in the table below  most of the reserves relate to the billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly to the gses and to the billion in mortgage loans sold to purchasers who placed them into active insured securitizations 
allocation of representation and warranty reserves reserve liability december  loans sold to dollars in millions  except for loans sold gses and active insured securitizations inactive insured securitizations and others total reflects  in billions  the total original principal balance of mortgage loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third party investors between and the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries will depend on  among other things  actual future mortgage loan performance  the actual level of future repurchase and indemnification requests including the extent  if any  to which inactive insured securitizations and other currently inactive investors ultimately assert claims  the actual success rates of claimants  developments in litigation  actual recoveries on the collateral and macroeconomic conditions including unemployment levels and housing prices 
as part of our business planning processes  we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes that would justify an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards 
we believe that the upper end of the reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond the current accrual levels  including reasonably possible future losses relating to the us bank litigation  dbsp litigation and the fhlb of boston litigation  could be as high as billion  the 
table of contents capital one financial corporation notes to consolidated statements continued same level as we provided as of september  and an increase of million from the estimate we provided as of december  this increase is attributable to increased activity from uninsured investors  increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny of mortgage practices and continued difficulty in the housing market and overall economy 
notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of loss beyond our current accrual levels based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimated upper end of the amount of reasonably possible losses 
there is still significant uncertainty regarding the numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels  including  but not limited to  litigation outcomes  future repurchase claims levels  ultimate repurchase success rates and mortgage loan performance levels 
litigation in accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies  we establish reserves for litigation related matters when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance 
below we provide a description of material legal proceedings and claims 
for some of the matters disclosed below  we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build  but which are reasonably possible outcomes 
for other disclosed matters  such an estimate is not possible at this time 
for those matters where an estimate is possible  excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the us bank litigation  the dbsp litigation  and the fhlb of boston litigation because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the range of reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above  management currently estimates the aggregate high end of the range of possible loss is million to million 
notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information  it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here 
given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters  and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters  there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period

note subsequent events ing direct on june   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with ing groep nv  ing bank nv  ing direct nv  ing direct bancorp collectively  the ing sellers  under which we would acquire substantially all of the ing sellers ing direct business in the united states ing direct 
on february   we closed the acquisition of ing direct  which included i the acquisition of all the equity interests of ing bank  fsb  ii the acquisition of all the equity interests of each of ws realty  llc and ing direct community development llc and iii the acquisition of certain other assets and the assumption of certain other liabilities of ing direct bancorp 
headquartered in wilmington  delaware  ing direct is the largest direct bank in the united states 
with the closing of the transaction  we add over seven million customers and billion in deposits to become the sixth largest depository institution and the leading direct bank in the united states 
in exchange for the equity interests and assets and liabilities associated with ing direct  we transferred consideration of  shares of capital one common stock with a fair value of approximately billion as of february  and approximately billion in cash to the ing sellers 
in the third quarter of  we closed a public underwritten offering of million shares of our common stock  subject to forward sale agreements 
we settled the forward sale agreements entirely by physical delivery of shares of common stock in exchange for cash proceeds from the forward purchasers of approximately billion on february  direct costs related to the equity offering of million were deferred and offset against the net proceeds at settlement 
in the third quarter of  we also closed a public offering of four different series of senior notes for total cash proceeds of billion 
the net proceeds from the equity and debt offerings along with cash from current liquidity sources were used to fund the cash component of the purchase price 
because we closed the ing direct transaction subsequent to december   the results for ing direct are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the ing direct transaction will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires  among other things  that we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
given the limited time between the acquisition date and the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for  the allocation of the purchase price of ing direct based on the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of february  has not yet been completed 
we are in the process of assembling and assessing information to assist us in determining the required fair value measures at acquisition 
we expect to substantially complete the initial accounting for ing direct  including the purchase price allocation  later in the first quarter of we will begin reporting the results of ing direct for the period from the date of acquisition in our consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of we also will provide the following additional information  which is currently not available to us  in our first quarter consolidated financial statements comparative consolidated pro forma revenue and net income results as if the acquisition of ing direct had occurred as of january

sale of visa shares in january  we sold our  class b shares of visa inc common stock to another financial institution for approximately million 
we expect to recognize a pre tax gain of approximately million on the sale of the class b shares during the quarter ending march  visa s class b shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions prior to the settlement of covered litigation involving visa  mastercard international and several member banks including capital one 
upon the lifting of the transfer restrictions  the class b shares convert into class a shares based on a conversion ratio calculated by visa 
in conjunction with the sale of the class b shares  we entered into a derivative agreement under which  among other things  we will make cash payments to the buyer whenever the conversion ratio of the class b shares into class a shares is reduced  and the buyer will make cash payments to us for any increase in the conversion ratio 
we determined that the initial fair value of this derivative was a liability of million which represents an estimate of the exposure liability from probable litigation losses  and is factored into the calculation of the pre tax gain 
a fair degree of subjectivity is used in estimating the fair value of the derivative liability  as such  our eventual cost could be significantly higher or lower than the current estimate
