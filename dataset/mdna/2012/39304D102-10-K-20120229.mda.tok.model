in this annual report  unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires  green dot  we  us  and our refer to green dot corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview green dot is a leading financial services company providing simple  low cost and convenient money management solutions to a broad base of us consumers 
we believe that we are the leading provider of general purpose reloadable  or gpr  prepaid debit cards in the united states and that our green dot network is the leading reload network for prepaid cards in the united states 
we sell our cards and offer our reload services nationwide at approximately  retail store locations  which provide consumers convenient access to our products and services 
we review a number of metrics to help us monitor the performance of  and identify trends affecting  our business 
we believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual performance 
number of gpr cards activated represents the total number of gpr cards sold through our retail and online distribution channels that are activated and  in the case of our online channel  also funded by cardholders in a specified period 
we activated million  million  and million gpr cards in the twelve month periods ended december    and  respectively  and million and  gpr cards in the five month periods ended december  and  respectively 
the number of new gpr card activations from repeat customers  or former gpr cardholders  in the same comparable periods were million  million and million  million and million  respectively 
number of cash transfers represents the total number of moneypak and pos swipe reload transactions that we sell through our retail distributors in a specified period 
we sold million  million  and million moneypak and pos swipe reload transactions for the twelve month periods ended december    and  respectively  and million and million moneypak and pos swipe reload transactions for the five month periods ended december  and  respectively 
number of active cards represents the total number of gpr cards in our portfolio that had a purchase  reload or atm withdrawal transaction during the previous day period 
we had million  million  million  and million active cards outstanding as of december     and  respectively 
gross dollar volume represents the total dollar volume of funds loaded to our gpr card and reload products 
our gross dollar volume was billion  billion  and billion for the twelve month periods ended december    and  respectively  and billion and billion for the five month periods ended december  and  respectively 
total operating revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december  total operating revenues were favorably impacted by increases in card revenues and other fees  cash transfer revenues and interchange revenues primarily due to period over period growth in all of our key metrics described above  partially offset by our recognition of stock based retailer incentive compensation  which increased million  or  in the year ended december  for the comparable period in  we recorded eight months of stock based retailer incentive compensation  beginning may we derived approximately of total operating revenues  excluding stock based retailer incentive compensation from the intuit program for the year ended december   which was discontinued in october we estimate that approximately million 
table of contents of our total operating revenues generated from the intuit program  the largest concentration of which  approximately million  occurred in the first quarter of  will not recur in furthermore  intuit had a disproportionate impact on our key metrics in the first quarter of approximately of gross dollar volume  of gpr cards activated and of the number of active cards were related to this discontinued program 
net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  net income grew for the year ended december   reflecting the total operating revenue growth described above  volume incentives on processing and call center costs and a lower overall effective tax rate compared to the year ended december  key components of our results of operations operating revenues we classify our operating revenues into the following four categories card revenues and other fees card revenues consist of monthly maintenance fees  atm fees  new card fees and other revenues 
we charge maintenance fees on gpr cards to cardholders on a monthly basis pursuant to the terms and conditions in our cardholder agreements 
we charge atm fees to cardholders when they withdraw money at certain atms in accordance with the terms and conditions in our cardholder agreements 
we charge new card fees when a consumer purchases a gpr or gift card in a retail store 
other revenues consist primarily of fees associated with optional products or services  which we generally offer to consumers during the card activation process 
optional products and services include providing a second card for an account  expediting delivery of the personalized gpr card that replaces the temporary card obtained at the retail store and upgrading a cardholder account to one of our premium programs the vip program or premier card program which provide benefits for our more active cardholders 
our aggregate new card fee revenues vary based upon the number of gpr cards activated and the average new card fee 
the average new card fee depends primarily upon the mix of products that we sell since there are variations in new card fees among green dot branded and co branded products and between gpr cards and gift cards 
our aggregate monthly maintenance fee revenues vary primarily based upon the number of active cards in our portfolio and the average fee assessed per account 
our average monthly maintenance fee per active account depends upon the mix of green dot branded and co branded cards in our portfolio and upon the extent to which fees are waived based on significant usage 
our aggregate atm fee revenues vary based upon the number of cardholder atm transactions and the average fee per atm transaction 
the average fee per atm transaction depends upon the mix of green dot branded and co branded active cards in our portfolio and the extent to which cardholders enroll in our vip program  which has no atm fees  or conduct atm transactions on our fee free atm network  consisting of over  nationwide atms as of december cash transfer revenues we earn cash transfer revenues when consumers purchase and use a moneypak or fund their cards through a pos swipe reload transaction in a retail store 
our aggregate cash transfer revenues vary based upon the total number of moneypak and pos swipe reload transactions and the average price per moneypak or pos swipe reload transaction 
the average price per moneypak or pos swipe reload transaction depends upon the relative numbers of cash transfer sales at our different retail distributors and on the mix of moneypak and pos swipe reload transactions at certain retailers that have different fees for the two types of reload transactions 
interchange revenues we earn interchange revenues from fees remitted by the merchant s bank  which are based on rates established by the payment networks  when cardholders make purchase transactions using our cards 
our aggregate interchange revenues vary based primarily on the number of active cards in our portfolio  the average transactional volume of the active cards in our portfolio and on the mix of cardholder purchases between those using signature identification technologies and those using personal identification numbers 
stock based retailer incentive compensation in may  we issued to walmart  shares of our class a common stock  subject to our right to repurchase them at per share upon a qualifying termination of our prepaid card program agreement with walmart and ge capital retail bank  formerly ge money bank 
we recognize each month the fair value of the  shares issued to walmart for which our right to repurchase has lapsed using the then current fair market value of our class a common stock and we would be required to recognize the fair value of all shares still subject to repurchase if there were an early expiration of our right to repurchase  which could occur if we experienced certain changes in our control or under certain other limited circumstances  such as a termination of our commercial agreement with walmart and ge capital retail bank 
we record the fair value recognized as stock based retailer incentive compensation  a contra revenue component of our total operating revenues 

table of contents operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into the following four categories sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the sales commissions we pay to our retail distributors and brokers for sales of our gpr and gift cards and reload services in their stores  advertising and marketing expenses  and the costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages  placards and promotional materials to our retail distributors and personalized gpr cards to consumers who have activated their cards 
we generally establish sales commission percentages in long term distribution agreements with our retail distributors  and aggregate sales commissions are determined by the number of prepaid cards and cash transfers sold at their respective retail stores 
we incur advertising and marketing expenses for television  online and in store promotions 
advertising and marketing expenses are recognized as incurred and typically deliver a benefit over an extended period of time 
for this reason  these expenses do not always track changes in our operating revenues 
our manufacturing and distribution costs vary primarily based on the number of gpr cards activated 
compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expenses represent the compensation and benefits that we provide to our employees and the payments we make to third party contractors 
while we have an in house customer service function  we employ third party contractors to conduct all call center operations  handle routine customer service inquiries and provide consulting support in the area of it operations and elsewhere 
compensation and benefits expenses associated with our customer service and loss management functions generally vary in line with the size of our active card portfolio  while the expenses associated with other functions do not 
processing expenses processing expenses consist primarily of the fees charged to us by the banks that issue our prepaid cards  the third party card processor that maintains the records of our customers accounts and processes transaction authorizations and postings for us  and the payment networks  which process transactions for us 
these costs generally vary based on the total number of active cards in our portfolio and gross dollar volume 
other general and administrative expenses other general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional service fees  telephone and communication costs  depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment  transaction losses losses from customer disputed transactions  unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud  rent and utilities  and insurance 
we incur telephone and communication costs primarily from customers contacting us through our toll free telephone numbers 
these costs vary with the total number of active cards in our portfolio as do losses from unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud 
costs associated with professional services  depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment  and rent and utilities vary based upon our investment in infrastructure  business development  risk management and internal controls and are generally not correlated with our operating revenues or other transaction metrics 
income tax expense our income tax expense consists of the federal and state corporate income taxes accrued on income resulting from the sale of our products and services 
since the majority of our operations are based in california  most of our state taxes are paid to that state 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current circumstances and various other assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product is sold or the service is performed  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we defer and recognize new card fee revenues on a straight line basis over the period commensurate with our service obligation to our customers 
we consider the service obligation period to be the average card lifetime 
we 
table of contents determine the average card lifetime for each pool of homogeneous products eg  products that exhibit the same characteristics such as nature of service and terms and conditions based on company specific historical data 
currently  we determine the average card lifetime separately for our gpr cards and gift cards 
for our gpr cards  we measure the card lifetime as the period of time  inclusive of reload activity  between sale or activation of a card and the date of the last positive balance on that card 
we analyze gpr cards activated between six and forty two months prior to each balance sheet date 
we use this historical look back period as a basis for determining our average card lifetime because it provides sufficient time for meaningful behavioral trends to develop 
currently  our gpr cards have an average card lifetime of nine months 
the usage of gift cards is limited to the initial funds loaded to the card 
therefore  we measure these gift cards lifetime as the redemption period over which cardholders perform the substantial majority of their transactions 
currently  gift cards have an average lifetime of six months 
we reassess average card lifetime quarterly 
average card lifetimes may vary in the future as cardholder behavior changes relative to historical experience because customers are influenced by changes in the pricing of our services  the availability of substitute products  and other factors 
we also defer and expense commissions paid to retail distributors related to new card sales ratably over the average card lifetime  which is currently nine months for our gpr cards and six months for gift cards 
we report our different types of revenues on a gross or net basis based on our assessment of whether we act as a principal or an agent in the transaction 
to the extent we act as a principal in the transaction  we report revenues on a gross basis 
in concluding whether or not we act as a principal or an agent  we evaluate whether we have the substantial risks and rewards under the terms of the revenue generating arrangements  whether we are the party responsible for fulfillment of the services purchased by the cardholders  and other factors 
for all of our significant revenue generating arrangements  including gpr and gift cards  we recognize revenues on a gross basis 
generally  customers have limited rights to a refund of the new card fee or a cash transfer fee 
we have elected to recognize revenues prior to the expiration of the refund period  but reduce revenues by the amount of expected refunds  which we estimate based on actual historical refunds 
on occasion  we enter into incentive agreements with our retail distributors and offer incentives to customers designed to increase product acceptance and sales volume 
we record these incentives  including the issuance of equity instruments  as a reduction of revenues and recognize them over the period the related revenues are recognized or as services are rendered  as applicable 
reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts cardholder account overdrafts may arise from maintenance fee assessments on our gpr cards or from purchase transactions that we honor on gpr or gift cards  in each case in excess of the funds in the cardholder s account 
we are responsible to the banks that issue our cards for any losses associated with these overdrafts 
overdrawn account balances are therefore deemed to be our receivables due from cardholders  and we include them as a component of accounts receivable  net  on our consolidated balance sheets 
the banks that issue our cards fund the overdrawn account balances on our behalf 
we include our obligations to them on our consolidated balance sheets as amounts due to card issuing banks for overdrawn accounts  a current liability  and we settle our obligations to them based on the terms specified in their agreements with us 
these settlement terms generally require us to settle on a monthly basis or when the cardholder account is closed  depending on the card issuing bank 
we generally recover overdrawn account balances from those gpr cardholders that perform a reload transaction 
in addition  we recover some purchase transaction overdrafts through enforcement of payment network rules  which allow us to recover the amounts from the merchant where the purchase transaction was conducted 
however  we are exposed to losses from unrecovered gpr cardholder account overdrafts 
the probability of recovering these amounts is primarily related to the number of days that have elapsed since an account had activity  such as a purchase  atm transaction or fee assessment 
generally  we recover of overdrawn account balances in accounts that have had activity in the last days  less than in accounts that have had activity in the last to days  and less than when more than days have elapsed 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts for maintenance fees we assess and purchase transactions we honor  in each case in excess of a cardholder s account balance 
we classify overdrawn accounts into age groups based on the number of days since the account last had activity 
we then calculate a reserve factor for each age group based on the average recovery rate for the most recent six months 
these factors are applied to these age groups to estimate our overall reserve 
we rely on these historical rates because they have remained relatively consistent for several years 
when more than days have passed without any activity in an account  we consider recovery to be remote and charge off the full amount of the overdrawn account balance against the reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts 

table of contents overdrafts due to maintenance fee assessments comprised approximately of our total overdrawn account balances due from cardholders for the year ended december  we charge our gpr cardholder accounts maintenance fees on a monthly basis pursuant to the terms and conditions in the applicable cardholder agreements 
although cardholder accounts become inactive or overdrawn  we continue to provide cardholders the ongoing functionality of our gpr cards  which allows them to reload and use their cards at any time 
as a result  we continue to assess a maintenance fee until a cardholder account becomes overdrawn by an amount equal to two maintenance fees  currently for the walmart moneycard and for our green dot branded gpr cards 
we recognize the fees ratably over the month for which they are assessed  net of the related provision for uncollectible overdrawn accounts  as a component of card revenues and other fees in our consolidated statements of operations 
we include our provision for uncollectible overdrawn accounts related to purchase transactions in other general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
our recovery rates may change in the future in response to factors such as the pricing of reloads and new cards and the availability of substitute products 
employee stock based compensation we record employee stock based compensation expense using the fair value method of accounting 
for stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  we base compensation expense on fair values estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
for stock awards  including restricted stock units  we base compensation expense on the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
we recognize compensation expense for awards with only service conditions that have graded vesting schedules on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
vesting is based upon continued service to our company 
we measure the fair value of equity instruments issued to non employees as of the earlier of the date a performance commitment has been reached by the counterparty or the date performance is completed by the counterparty 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model or the fair value of our class a or class b common stock  as applicable  and recognize related expense in the same periods that the goods or services are received 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  which requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
it eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the asu does not change the items which must be reported in other comprehensive income  how such items are measured or when they must be reclassified to net income 
this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which converges common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in accordance with gaap and ifrs 
this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  our adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements  which requires additional information in the roll forward of level assets and liabilities  including the presentation of purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
this asu impacts disclosures only 
we adopted this asu in the first quarter of 
table of contents comparison of years ended december  and operating revenues the following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees  cash transfer revenues and interchange revenues as well as contra revenue items years ended december  amount of total operating revenues amount of total operating revenues in thousands  except percentages operating revenues card revenues and other fees cash transfer revenues interchange revenues stock based retailer incentive compensation total operating revenues card revenues and other fees card revenues and other fees totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of period over period growth of in the number of gpr cards activated and in the number of active cards in our portfolio 
this growth was driven by a variety of factors including growth in the number of our cards sold through our established distribution channels and expansion through our online distribution channel 
under new regulations  beginning in the second half of  we will be required to provide at least one fee free atm withdrawal per month for each card issued under the walmart moneycard program 
while atm fees  a component of our card revenues and other fees  will be negatively impacted by this change  we do not expect that our operating results will be materially impacted because we anticipate that our operating revenues will be positively impacted by increases in card usage and cardholder retention as a result of this change 
cash transfer revenues cash transfer revenues totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of period over period growth of in the number of cash transfers sold 
the increase in cash transfer volume was driven both by growth in our active card base and growth in cash transfer volume from third party programs participating in our network 
interchange revenues interchange revenues totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of period over period growth of in the number of active cards in our portfolio  an increase in the average transactional volume of the active cards in our portfolio and a increase in gross dollar volume  which was driven by the factors discussed above under card revenues and other fees 
during the first three quarters of  our interchange revenues benefited from a large number of taxpayers who elected to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit on our cards and using those funds for purchase transactions 
we expect to experience a seasonal pattern in our interchange revenues during similar to  as we believe that gross dollar volume loaded to our cards will be significantly higher during the first quarter of  as compared to the remaining quarters of  due to a larger number of taxpayers electing to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit on our cards 
in addition  we expect that the contribution from taxpayers in will be negatively impacted by intuit s nonrenewal of its joint marketing and referral agreement with us  which expired in october and had a significant impact on our operating revenues and key metrics in stock based retailer incentive compensation our right to repurchase lapsed as to  shares issued to walmart during the year ended december  we recognized the fair value of the shares using the then current fair market value of our class a common stock  resulting in million of stock based retailer incentive compensation  an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in while our stock price was generally lower in than it was in  the increase in stock based retailer incentive compensation reflected the fact that we recorded four fewer months of this expense in than we did in as we first issued the shares subject to repurchase in may in connection with entering into our amended prepaid card agreement with walmart and ge capital retail bank in may 
table of contents operating expenses the following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing  compensation and benefits  processing  and other general and administrative expenses years ended december  amount of total operating revenues amount of total operating revenues in thousands  except percentages operating expenses sales and marketing expenses compensation and benefits expenses processing expenses other general and administrative expenses total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of increased numbers of gpr cards and cash transfers sold  compared with the corresponding period in  and an increase in sales commissions due largely to increased sales commissions paid to walmart as a result of entering into our amended prepaid card agreement with walmart and ge capital retail bank in may compensation and benefits expenses compensation and benefits expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in this increase was primarily the result of a million increase in employee compensation and benefits  which included a million increase in employee stock based compensation 
the period over period growth in employee compensation and benefits is due to additional employee headcount as we continued to expand our operations to support key growth initiatives  new product development and new sales efforts  and growth in our it infrastructure and risk operations 
the increase in compensation and benefits expenses was also due to a million increase in third party call center contractor expenses as the number of active cards in our portfolio and associated call volumes increased during the year ended december  however  our call center costs  as a percentage of our total operating revenues  were lower than the comparable period in as a result of volume incentives received from our third party providers 
processing expenses processing expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase was primarily the result of period over period growth of in the number of active cards in our portfolio and in gross dollar volume and a million increase in atm processing fees as the volume of atm transactions increased during the year ended december  processing expenses were partially offset by volume incentives from the payment networks 
while we expect processing expenses to be favorably impacted by the transition of our card issuing program with columbus bank and trust company to our subsidiary bank  which we expect will commence in the second half of  there can be no assurance that our processing expenses will decline on a year over year basis in absolute dollars or as percentage of total operating revenues in because these expenses are subject to a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control 
other general and administrative expenses other general and administrative expenses totaled million for the years ended december   an increase of million  or  from the comparable period in the increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a million increase in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  a million increase in our provision for uncollectible overdrawn accounts related to purchase transactions  and a million increase in transaction losses  primarily associated with customer disputed transactions  which fluctuate based on changes in gross dollar volume 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in professional service expenses 
during the year ended december   we incurred significant professional services expenses in connection with our initial public offering  which was completed in july we expect to incur additional rent expense of between million and million associated with our new headquarters while we are in the process of completing tenant improvements prior to occupying them in the second half of
