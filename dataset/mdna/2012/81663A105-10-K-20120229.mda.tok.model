rose rock midstream  lp rose rock was formed in august on november   semgroup corporation contributed a wholly owned subsidiary  semcrude  lp  to rose rock  in return for limited partner interests  general partner interests  and certain incentive distribution rights in rose rock 
on december   rose rock completed an initial public offering ipo in which it sold  common units representing limited partner interests 
based on our control of  and ownership interest in  rose rock  we continue to consolidate rose rock and account for other partnership interest in rose rock as non controlling interest 
we previously referred to the crude business segment as semcrude  but following the contribution of semcrude  lp to rose rock  we decided to change the name of the segment to crude 
the crude business segment holds a ownership interest in white cliffs pipeline llc and a general partner interest and a limited partner interest in rose rock 
industry overview we move petroleum products throughout the us  canada  mexico and the uk we provide gathering  transportation  storage  distribution  marketing and other midstream services to producers and refiners of petroleum products 
the market we serve  which begins at the point of purchase at the source of production and extends to the point of distribution to the end user customer  is commonly referred to as the midstream market 
regional production of petroleum products in the us the us department of energy divides the continental us into five geographic regions called petroleum administration for defense districts  or padds 
padd is the midwest region of the us padd is the second largest padd in terms of refinery production  surpassed only by padd as a result of the flow of petroleum products across and throughout the midwest region  we believe padd is an important crude oil production  logistics and refining center 
logo according to energy information administration eia data  as of november  approximately  or million barrels per day bpd  of total us daily refining capacity was in padd also  according to november eia reports  padd produces approximately  or million bpd  of total us daily crude oil production and imports approximately  or million bpd  of total us daily imports 

table of contents padd refiners source crude oil from the gulf coast  rocky mountain  canada s western canadian sedimentary basin  which includes alberta and parts of saskatchewan to the east and british columbia to the west  and major commodity hubs in the us the production of petroleum products by padd refiners and processors historically has been less than the demand for petroleum products within that region  with the shortfall being supplied via common carrier pipelines primarily from the gulf coast  canada and  to a lesser extent  the rocky mountain and east coast regions 
additional petroleum product supply is available via barge transport up the mississippi river with significant deliveries into local markets along the ohio river 
increased importance of independents and specialization in the s  the major oil companies began focusing primarily on large scale oil and gas projects 
until recently  this resulted in the major oil companies focusing more on foreign and deep water exploration and production activities 
as a result  they sold many of their north american integrated oil and gas assets  including producing properties  proprietary transportation systems  storage and distribution networks and refineries to independent operators 
whereas the major oil companies typically owned and operated proprietary networks that handled every aspect of the production  refining  storage  transportation and marketing of petroleum products  independent operators have generally focused on a single activity 
as a result  the north american market is increasingly characterized by independent oil and gas producers and refiners that are generally without their own gathering  transportation  storage and distribution infrastructure 
we focus on providing these services  using our asset base and distribution  processing and marketing expertise to provide independent operators with a stable source of supply and market access for their petroleum products 
crude oil industry overview refined petroleum products  such as jet fuel  gasoline and distillate fuel oil  are all sources of energy derived from crude oil 
according to data compiled by the eia  petroleum currently accounts for about of the nation s total annual energy consumption 
growth in petroleum consumption is expected to keep pace with growth in overall energy consumption over the next to years 
the eia expects us annual petroleum consumption to grow from million barrels per day in to million barrels per day in the diagram below depicts the segments of the crude oil value chain and our participation in the crude oil industry 
logo 
table of contents our crude oil business operates primarily in colorado  kansas  north dakota  oklahoma and texas where there are extensive crude oil production operations 
our assets extend from gathering systems in and around producing fields to transportation pipelines carrying crude oil to logistics hubs  such as the cushing interchange  where we have terminalling and storage facilities that aid our customers in managing the delivery of crude oil 
gathering and transportation pipeline transportation is generally the lowest cost method for shipping crude oil and transports about two thirds of the petroleum shipped in the us crude oil pipelines transport oil from the wellhead to logistics hubs and or refineries 
crude oil gathering assets generally consist of a network of smaller diameter pipelines that are connected directly to the well site or central receipt points delivering into larger diameter trunk lines 
logistic hubs like the cushing interchange provide storage and connections to other pipeline systems and modes of transportation  such as tankers  railroads and trucks 
trucking complements pipeline gathering systems by gathering crude oil from operators at remote wellhead locations not served by pipeline gathering systems 
trucking is generally limited to low volume  short haul movements because trucking costs escalate sharply with distance  making trucking the most expensive mode of crude oil transportation 
storage terminals and supply storage terminals complement the crude oil pipeline gathering and transportation systems and address a fundamental imbalance in the energy industry wherein crude oil is often produced in different locations and at different times than it is ultimately consumed 
within the us  there are also geographical imbalances  as a substantial majority of the petroleum refining that occurs in the us east of the rocky mountains is concentrated in the gulf coast region  particularly louisiana and texas which  according to the eia  accounts for approximately of all refining capacity in the united states 
over time  the crude oil storage business has evolved from its beginnings as a component of integrated production processes into a mature  stand alone operation 
terminals are facilities in which crude oil is transferred to or from a storage facility or transportation system  such as a gathering pipeline  to another transportation system  such as trucks or another pipeline 
terminals play a key role in moving crude oil to end users  such as refineries  by providing the following services inventory management  distribution  and upgrading to achieve marketable grades or qualities of crude oil 
overview of cushing interchange the cushing interchange is one of the largest crude oil marketing hubs in the us and is the designated point of delivery specified in all nymex crude oil futures contracts 
as the nymex delivery point and a cash market hub  the cushing interchange serves as a significant source of refinery feedstock for midwest refiners and plays an integral role in establishing and maintaining markets for many varieties of foreign and domestic crude oil 
natural gas industry overview in  according to eia data  natural gas was the second largest source of primary energy  accounting for of total us energy use in while the primary use for natural gas in the us is for residential heating  it also has a number of commercial  industrial and electric generation uses across several different customer bases 
the eia forecasts that natural gas consumption will increase from quadrillion btu in to quadrillion btu in 
table of contents since mid  north american natural gas prices have declined significantly as a result of drilling technology improvements and the recent development of shale 
demand for natural gas and ngls has historically been higher during the winter and lower during the summer  as gas is used primarily for heating and the need for it increases in cold months 
natural gas passes through many stages before reaching end users 
first  exploration and production companies locate and produce natural gas 
second  gathering companies collect the natural gas  sometimes sending it to processing plants where liquids and other elements are removed 
third  transmission companies transport the gas through pipelines to storage units or areas of high demand 
finally  distributors deliver the gas to customers 
the midstream natural gas industry is the link between upstream exploration and production activities and downstream end use markets 
the diagram below depicts the segments of the natural gas value chain and our participation in the natural gas industry 
logo we operate in the pipeline gathering and processing segments of the natural gas midstream industry in the us and canada 
the operating fundamentals of canadian natural gas processing operations differ somewhat from those in the us the most significant difference is that  unlike us natural gas processing facilities where the purchaser often purchases and owns the natural gas that it gathers and processes  in canadian natural gas processing operations  the processor typically does not take title to the natural gas it gathers and processes 
the processor  instead  receives fee income from transporting and processing natural gas owned by others 
as natural gas is processed to remove unwanted elements that interfere with pipeline transportation  higher value hydrocarbon liquids such as ngls and condensate are separated from the raw natural gas stream 
ngls are obtained during the production and processing of natural gas or are a by product from the crude oil distillation process within refineries 
supplies of ngls are determined by the level of natural gas production  the amount of liquids in the gas  refining capacity utilization and by imports of ngls 
condensate is a mixture of petroleum products consisting primarily of pentanes and heavier liquids extracted from natural gas 
it is used to make gasoline  jet fuel and as a diluent used to dilute crude bitumen so that it can be transported by pipeline 
we are engaged in residential propane supply operations in page and payson in arizona 

table of contents gas gathering the natural gas gathering process begins with the drilling of wells into gas bearing rock formations 
once a well has been completed  the well is connected to a gathering system 
gathering systems typically consist of a network of small diameter pipelines and  if necessary  compression systems that collect natural gas from points near producing wells and transport it to larger pipelines for further transmission 
gas dehydration wellhead gas is generally fully saturated with water vapor 
this water vapor must be removed from the gas stream to prevent formation of hydrates and condensation of free water in downstream facilities  to prevent corrosion and to meet downstream pipeline quality specifications 
dehydration is generally performed at central points along an upstream gathering system utilizing either a glycol absorption process or a solid desiccant adsorption process 
gas treating in addition to water vapor  wellhead gas contains impurities such as carbon dioxide  nitrogen  hydrogen sulfide  helium  oxygen and other inert components 
these impurities must be removed from the gas stream to protect downstream equipment  prevent corrosion and meet downstream pipeline quality specifications 
they are removed through a variety of processes utilizing chemical reaction  absorption  adsorption or permeation 
gas processing natural gas delivered to the burner tip is almost pure methane 
however  natural gas is produced from the reservoir containing impurities and heavier hydrocarbons entrained in the gas stream 
the heavier hydrocarbons of ngls must be removed from the wellhead gas stream before the gas is transported to market 
these heavier hydrocarbons are removed by processing the gas at plants  either through temperature and pressure manipulation or absorption 
the extracted heavier hydrocarbons have a high value and are sold separately to petrochemical manufacturers or wholesale marketers 
ngl terminalling  storage and supply the production of ngls by gas processing plants and refineries is fairly constant throughout the year  whereas demand is seasonal 
ngl terminalling and storage serves to balance this constant production or supply with the seasonal demand 
supply and marketing agreements are entered into with gas processors and refiners to market production on the supply side 
this supply is then marketed to petrochemical plants and retail customers  as well as other consumers of ngls 
overview of north american ngl hubs there are four major north american ngl trading centers located at edmonton  alberta  sarnia  ontario  conway  kansas  and mont belvieu  texas 
these locations have substantial underground storage and are connected to ngl supply  transmission and distribution systems 
edmonton and conway serve the us midwest market while sarnia and mont belvieu serve the us northeast market 
mont belvieu is the price reference point for north american ngl markets as it is the largest consuming region 
its strategic location on the gulf coast allows access to supplies from europe  africa and the middle east 
mont belvieu also has significant storage and pipelines to transport liquids to market and is close to large crude oil refineries 
petrochemical demand is approximately of ngl demand and is the main factor affecting mont belvieu ngl prices 
the two largest contributors to overall demand are weather  since propane is used in home heating and crop drying  and the petrochemical industry s requirement for ethane 
in general  ngls are priced higher than natural gas to cover the cost for extraction 

table of contents mexican asphalt industry mexico is the th largest country in the world based on land area and the th largest country in terms of population 
although its land area is only one fifth the size of the us  mexico has a population of roughly one third that of the us mexico has a large and diverse road network in place 
mexico s land transportation network is one of the most extensive in latin america with over  miles of paved roads 
roads are a critically important component of mexico s transportation infrastructure  with of its passengers and of its cargo being transported over road surfaces 
the use of rail and water transportation in mexico  in most cases  is either not practical or not available 
as a result  roads are a high priority item of the country 
the total current demand for road asphalt products in mexico is roughly million metric tons per year  requiring approximately million metric tons of asphalt  either as a raw material or for end use 
mexico s national highway infrastructure is comprised of three main components the federal network which includes both toll and toll free roads accounting for approximately of all roads  the regional network accounting for approximately  and the rural network consisting of approximately 
the federal road system is the responsibility of the secretary of communications and transportation sct  while the regional network of roads is the responsibility of state governments 
rural and state roads and low volume roads are also improved by the states 
these networks help establish the annual demand for asphalt 
asphalt demand can increase  or decline  at a pace comparable to the level of on going highway expansion and or maintenance projects 
such projects rely on the availability of government concessions  continued public private partnership undertakings and locally funded ventures 
european petroleum products storage industry storage for refined products and crude oil is critical to the european economy 
fluctuations in demand for crude oil and transportation fuels  combined with changing flows of petroleum product production and refining capacity  means storage is necessary to balance demand 
additionally  supply and demand disruptions due to weather  industry upsets  political tensions and terrorism have forced industry participants to understand the significance that access to storage  and the availability of storage  will have over the future years 
the independent storage industry has experienced fluctuating demand for its services over recent years from major oil companies  oil traders and strategic storage agencies government entities that store fuel to protect against significant fluctuations in supply or demand as mandated by the european union and the international energy agency 
the construction of new tank storage facilities has historically been restricted  resulting in a supply shortage 
however  high crude oil prices and backwardated market conditions ie  prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices have had a negative effect on storage economics 
as a result  demand for such storage facilities is currently weak 
our business we provide gathering  transportation  storage  distribution  marketing and other midstream services primarily to independent producers  refiners of petroleum products and other market participants located in the midwest and rocky mountain regions of the us  canada and the west coast of the uk we  or our significant equity method investees  have an asset base consisting of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities  terminals  processing plants and other distribution assets located between north american production and supply areas  including the gulf coast  midwest  rocky mountain and western canadian regions

semgas semgas provides natural gas gathering and processing services 
it has gathering and processing plants and assets in kansas  oklahoma and texas 
semgas aggregates gas supplies from the wellhead and provides various services to producers that condition the wellhead gas production for downstream markets 
assets and operations semgas currently owns and operates over miles of gathering pipelines in kansas  oklahoma and texas 
semgas has one processing plant located in sherman  texas  with a processing capacity of million cubic feet per day and over miles of low pressure gathering lines 
semgas also has two plants in northern oklahoma nash and hopeton located roughly miles apart  with a combined processing capacity of approximately million cubic feet per day 
this area  also called the mississippi zone  has emerged into a key oil resource 
table of contents play with associated gas 
there are approximately  acres dedicated to semgas  from several area producers  with about  acres in the core of the emerging mississippian play 
additionally  semgas owns a eufaula gathering system which gathers  dehydrates and compresses gas in eastern oklahoma  and a gathering system in kansas 
revenue and marketing semgas generates revenue from a portfolio of contracts 
initial contract terms can range from two years to the life of the reserves and  upon expiration  continue to renew on a month to month or year to year evergreen basis 
the majority of the contracts provide upside potential by providing semgas participation in commodity price and processing margin upswings through percent of proceeds and percent of index contracts 
on these contracts  semgas is generally responsible for marketing the gas and ngls for both its and the producers share of the products 
percent of proceeds contracts are based on semgas paying the producers a percentage of the sale proceeds from the products and percent of index contracts are based on semgas paying the producers a percentage of the sale proceeds based on an index price 
semgas also has fee based contracts for processing and gathering services 
semgas customers include producers  operators  marketers and traders 
market and competitive strengths semgas gathering and processing volumes can be impacted by market demand for the products it handles  as well as the price for crude oil because the mississippi zone is primarily a crude oil play with associated natural gas and natural gas liquids 
gathering and processing activities are also reliant on continued drilling and production activity by producers in our areas of operation 
while price increases in natural gas might lead to increased drilling and supply  price increases can also adversely affect demand 
we face competition in acquiring new natural gas supplies 
the natural gas gathering and processing industry is generally characterized by regional competition  based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing plants to natural gas producing wells 
semgas gathering and processing assets tend to have relatively long term contracts and  in some instances  are the only assets that can provide the offered services to the customers 
semgas generally sells all natural gas and ngls it obtains under its percentage of proceeds and percentage of index contracts immediately in the spot market and  therefore  has little commodity price risk with respect to inventory or other physical commodity positions 
semgas percentage of proceeds and percentage of index processing contracts intrinsically have commodity price risk since semgas fees  with respect to these contracts  vary with the level of natural gas and commodity prices 
semgas may elect to use financial derivatives to hedge this risk 
semgas is limited in the amount  and in the time period  for which it may hedge its commodity price risk associated with its contracts pursuant to our comprehensive risk management policy 
more generally  all of our marketing and hedging activities are subject to our comprehensive risk management policy which establishes a set of limits  both at the semgas and the semgroup corporation levels  to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure 
risk governance and comprehensive risk management policy we expect to generate the majority of our earnings from owning and operating strategic assets while endeavoring to prudently manage all risks  including commodity price risk  associated with the ownership and operations of our assets 
we have a comprehensive risk management policy that reflects an enterprise wide approach to risk management and considers both financial and non financial risks 
our board of directors is responsible for the oversight of our enterprise wide risk and has approved our comprehensive risk management policy 
the comprehensive risk management policy is designed to ensure we identify and communicate our risk appetite and risk tolerances  
table of contents establish an organizational structure that prudently separates responsibilities for executing  valuing and reporting our business activities  value where appropriate  report and manage all material business risks in a timely and accurate manner  effectively delegate authority for committing our resources  foster the efficient use of capital and collateral  and minimize the risk of a material adverse event 
the audit committee of our board of directors has oversight responsibilities for the implementation of  and compliance with  our comprehensive risk management policy 
our executive management committee  comprised of corporate officers  oversees the financial and non financial risks associated with all activities governed by our comprehensive risk management policy including asset operations  marketing and trading  investments  divestitures  and other capital expenditures and dispositions  credit risk management  and other strategic activities 
we also have a risk management group that is assigned responsibility for independently monitoring compliance with  reporting on  and enforcing the provisions of our comprehensive risk management policy 
our comprehensive risk management policy provides a set of limits or thresholds for activities related to owned assets  physical commodities  and derivatives and capital transactions involving market and credit risk 
our limits monitor these risks for each individual segment and on a consolidated basis 
our comprehensive risk management policy also specifies the types of transactions that may be executed by incumbents of named positions without specific approval of our board of directors or our executive management committee 
it also restricts proprietary trading activities within limits significantly more restrictive than the corporate market risk management limits 
competition we face intense competition in the operations of each of our segments 
our competitors include other midstream companies  major integrated oil companies and their marketing affiliates  crude oil pipeline companies and independent gatherers  brokers and marketers of petroleum products of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience 
some of these competitors have capital resources many times greater than ours and control greater supplies of crude oil and petroleum products 
competition for customers of petroleum products is based primarily on price  access to supply  access to logistics assets  distribution capabilities  the ability to meet regulatory requirements  and maintenance of quality of service and customer relationships 
operational hazards and insurance pipelines  terminals  storage tanks  processing plants or other facilities may experience damage as a result of an accident  natural disaster or deliberate act 
these hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  and destruction of  property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
through the services of a major national insurance broker  we have maintained insurance of various 
table of contents types and varying levels of coverage similar to that maintained by other companies in the industry and which we consider adequate  under the circumstances  to cover our operations and properties  including coverage for natural catastrophes  pollution related events and acts of terrorism and sabotage 
the limit of operational insurance maintained covering loss of  or damage to  property and products is million per loss and includes business interruption loss 
for claims arising under general liability  automobile liability and excess liability  the limits maintained total million per occurrence claim 
primary and excess liability insurance limits maintained for pollution liability claims vary by location for claims arising from gradual pollution with limits ranging from million to million in the aggregate 
the combined primary and excess liability insurance limits for claims arising from sudden and accidental pollution total million per claim and million in the aggregate 
this insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with the operating pipelines  terminals and other facilities 
we have a favorable claims history enabling us to self insure the working layer of loss activity utilizing deductibles and self insured retentions commensurate with our financial abilities and in line with industry standards  in order to create a more efficient and cost effective program and a consistent risk profile 
the working layer consists of high frequency low severity losses that are best retained and managed in house 
sizeable or difficult self insured claims or losses may be handled by professional adjusting firms hired by us 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of our deductibles and retentions as they relate to the overall cost and scope of our risk and insurance program 
with a few limited exceptions  our customers have not agreed to indemnify us for losses arising from a release of crude oil  and we may instead be required to indemnify our customers in the event of a release or other incident 
regulation general our operations are subject to extensive regulation 
the following discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting our operations should not be relied on as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting us  due to the myriad of complex federal  state  provincial  foreign and local regulations that may affect our business 
regulation of us pipeline and storage operations interstate storage and transportation white cliffs pipeline is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc because the rates charged to shippers on the pipeline system are required to be filed with  and accepted by  ferc 
under the interstate commerce act the ica  ferc has authority to regulate companies that provide interstate petroleum based products pipeline transportation services  including pipeline operational transportation related storage services 
ferc s authority to regulate those interstate services includes the rates charged for services  terms and conditions of service  maintenance of accounts and records and various related ancillary matters 
regulated companies may not charge rates that have been determined not to be just and reasonable by ferc 
the rates  terms and conditions for our service are found in ferc approved tariffs 
pursuant to ferc s jurisdiction over rates  existing rates may be challenged by complaint and proposed rate increases and proposed changes in terms and conditions of service may be challenged by protest 
in addition  ferc prohibits petroleum and ngl based products transportation from unduly preferring  or unreasonably discriminating against  any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service 
gathering and intrastate pipeline regulation the ica  the natural gas act the nga and the natural gas policy act of do not apply to intrastate petroleum and natural gas based products facilities and activities  ie  those that are not used or usable in the conduct of interstate commerce 
ferc has ruled that intrastate petroleum and natural gas gathering 
table of contents systems are exempt from regulation by the commission 
we own a number of natural gas pipelines that we believe operate wholly intrastate and are  therefore  exempt from ferc regulation 
we also own a number of intrastate crude oil gathering systems that are subject to state and local  but not federal regulation 
these gathering systems are currently operated as proprietary systems and may be subject to regulation by ferc in the future 
in the states in which we operate  regulation of intrastate natural gas and crude oil gathering facilities and intrastate crude oil pipeline service generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint based rate regulation 
for example  our natural gas gathering facilities are  in some cases  subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes 
ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take  without undue discrimination  natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling 
common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer 
these statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply 
these statutes have the effect of restricting our right  as an owner of gathering facilities  to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport natural gas 
department of transportation all crude oil and liquefied petroleum gases interstate pipelines  and certain intrastate crude oil and liquefied petroleum gases pipelines and storage facilities  are subject to regulation by the department of transportation the dot with respect to the design  construction  operation and maintenance of the pipeline systems and storage facilities 
the dot routinely conducts audits of the regulated assets and we must make certain records and reports available to the dot for review as required by the secretary of transportation 
in some states  the dot has given a state agency authority to assume all or part of the regulatory and enforcement responsibility over the intrastate assets 
regulation of ngl terminals  distribution and utility operations semstream s arizona non regulated and regulated propane distribution operations are subject to the code set forth in the national fire protection association standard nfpa  standard for the storage and handling of liquefied petroleum gases 
arizona state agencies routinely conduct physical audits to ensure compliance with such regulations 
semstream arizona s utility operations are subject to regulation by the arizona corporation commission acc 
the acc regulates the sale price of propane gas to customers connected to our underground propane gas systems in payson and page  arizona 
the acc also conducts annual inspections of the payson and page utility underground pipeline systems under authority delegated to it from the dot 
trucking regulation through our interest ownership in rose rock  we operate a fleet of trucks to transport crude oil 
we are licensed to perform both intrastate and interstate motor carrier services and are subject to certain safety regulations issued by the dot 
dot regulations cover  among other things  driver operations  maintaining log books  truck manifest preparations  the placement of safety placards on the trucks and trailer vehicles  drug and alcohol testing  safety of operation and equipment and many other aspects of truck operations 
we are also subject to occupational safety and health administration osha regulations with respect to our trucking operations 
cross border regulation we are subject to regulatory matters specific to border crossing  which include export licenses  tariffs  customs and tax issues and toxic substance certifications 
regulations include the short supply controls of the 
table of contents export administration act  the north american free trade agreement  national energy board reporting and certification and the toxic substances control act 
violations of license  tariff and tax reporting requirements under these regulations could result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
furthermore  the failure to materially comply with applicable tax requirements could lead to the imposition of additional taxes  interest and penalties 
regulation of canadian gathering  processing  transportation and marketing businesses national energy board neb our canadian assets are not currently regulated by the neb 
the importation and exportation of natural gas and crude oil to and from canada  however  are regulated by the neb 
the government of alberta tracks volumes exported from alberta and  although it has not previously done so  reserves the right to limit the volume of natural gas that may be removed from alberta in the event of domestic supply constraint 
energy resources conservation board ercb the ercb s purpose is to ensure that the discovery  development and delivery of alberta s resources take place in an orderly and efficient manner and in the public interest 
among other matters  the ercb has the authority to regulate the exploration  production  gathering  processing  transmission and distribution of natural gas within the province 
with respect to natural gas gathering and processing activities  the ercb s primary role is to serve as a licensing authority for the construction and operation of the facilities used in those activities 
while the ercb has jurisdiction to regulate the rates and fees charged for services provided by these types of facilities using a public complaint process  this authority is discretionary and historically has not commonly been exercised 
generally  the complaint based method of regulation has meant that parties have had the opportunity to use alternative means to resolve disputes without resorting to the ercb 
sulphur recovery standards in  the ercb set more stringent sulphur recovery standards for older sour gas processing plants  as set out in id this interim directive directed older  grandfathered plants to either gradually increase their sulphur recovery to current standards or accept a reduction in their licensed capacity 
the k plant and the ka plant are capable of meeting de grandfathered recovery requirements 
the k plant was de grandfathered in after installation of a new super claus sulphur recovery process 
the ka plant can be de grandfathered via simple administrative application 
other provincial regulatory agencies the alberta boilers safety association absa is the regulatory agency in alberta of pressure systems with a mandate to ensure that pressure equipment is constructed and operated in a manner that protects public safety 
semcams maintains an approved program to meet all requirements 
regulation of uk operations in the uk  the department of energy and climate change s energy resources development unit is responsible for the regulation of a number of relevant areas  including licensing  fiscal policy  national oil stocks policy including their compulsory oil stocking obligations as a member of the european union and international energy agency  policy on oil disposal  offshore environmental policy  oil sharing arrangements and 
table of contents decommissioning 
other regulatory bodies include the health and safety executive  which regulates health and safety in the upstream and downstream oil industry among others and the hazardous installations directorate  which is responsible for inspection and enforcement of health and safety regulation with respect to the downstream oil industry among others 
there is no regulator dedicated specifically to the oil industry 
the activities of semlogistics may also be regulated as a result of the european union s participation in the international carriage of dangerous goods by road and rail agreements  as well as the international maritime dangerous goods code  which governs the safe transport of dangerous goods including oil by sea and  in due course  by the marine management organization when it comes into being pursuant to the marine and coastal access bill 
the department for environment food and rural affairs is responsible for setting legislation  policy  regulations and guidance for a number of environmental issues 
there are also several european and international laws and policies that apply 
semlogistics activities are regulated by the environment agency wales eaw 
eaw also oversees spills and their cleanup  as well as new construction of tanks  bunds spill prevention berms in the us and other improvements  and whose regulations require us to maintain a pollution prevention and control permit 
at a local level  semlogistics storage facility falls within the jurisdiction of the milford haven port authority the mhpa 
under the milford haven port authority act  the mhpa has the power to publish directions for the purpose of promoting or securing conditions conducive to the ease  convenience or safety of navigation in milford haven and the approaches to it 
mhpa is currently consulting on the milford haven port authority general directions 
mhpa also has powers and obligations under various regulations  including  among others  the dangerous substances in harbour areas regulations and the harbour docks and piers clauses act  as well as responsibility for the enforcement of the port marine safety code 
regulation of mexican operations semmexico is primarily engaged in the purchasing  production  modification  storage and distribution of liquid asphalt cement products throughout mexico 
these activities are subject to compliance with environmental laws and regulations under mexican technical official standards and other provisions that establish minimum technical requirements 
companies are required to obtain  from the corresponding federal  local and or municipal authorities  the relevant permits and authorizations to construct and operate asphalt modification plants and carry out the activities described above 
mexico s ministry of communications and transportation has published several construction standards establishing the specifications required for asphalt surfaces in connection with infrastructure projects  as well as certain manuals identifying the procedures for verifying compliance therewith 
asphalt treatment  storage and distribution activities are considered hazardous under applicable environmental laws and regulations and are subject to the scrutiny of the ministry of the environment and natural resources  which is the governmental agency in charge of granting the authorization for the handling  transportation  treatment  storage  importation  exportation and final disposal of asphalt  among others 
these authorizations are essential for semmexico to be able to perform its activities in mexico 
coupled with the authorizations and permits that may be granted by the ministry of the environment and natural resources  asphalt transportation activities within mexico are subject to having obtained a number of other federal and local permits  including federal licenses for the operators of transportation units mobilizing semmexico s liquid asphalt cement products 

table of contents environmental  health and safety regulation general our operations  including canadian  uk and mexican operations  are subject to varying degrees of stringent and complex laws and regulations by multiple levels of government relating to the production  transportation  storage  processing  release and disposal of petroleum and natural gas based products and other materials or otherwise relating to protection of the environment 
as with the industry generally  compliance with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall costs of business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade pipelines  equipment and facilities 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of removal or remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities 
the clear trend in environmental regulation  particularly with respect to petroleum product facilities  is the placement of more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and  thus  any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re interpretations of enforcement policies that result in costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to pass on such increased costs to our customers 
moreover  accidental releases  leaks or spills may occur in the course of our operations and we may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result  including those related to claims for damage to property  natural resources or persons 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us  there is no assurance that the current conditions will continue in the future 
the following is a summary of the more significant current environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which our operations are subject 
water discharges our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants  including oil 
the oil pollution act opa was enacted in and amends provisions of the federal water pollution control act of  as amended  the clean water act  as amended  and other statutes as they pertain to prevention of  and response to  oil spills 
the opa  the clean water act and analogous state  provincial and local laws  subject owners of facilities to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for containment and removal costs  natural resource damages and certain other consequences of an oil spill  where such spill is into navigable waters  along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the us in the event of an oil spill from one of our facilities into navigable waters  substantial liabilities could be imposed 
spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements of these laws require appropriate containment berms or dikes and other containment structures at storage facilities to prevent contamination of soils  surface waters and groundwater in the event of an oil overflow  rupture or leak 
the federal clean water act and analogous state and local laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the us and state waters  including groundwater in many jurisdictions 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into these waters 
the clean water act and analogous state and local laws provide significant penalties for unauthorized discharges and can impose liability for responding to and cleaning up spills 
in addition  the clean water act and analogous state and local laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
these permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities 
similar measures are in place in canada at both a federal and provincial level 

table of contents in addition  national  local and european union regulations and directives in the uk  and federal  state and local laws in mexico  impose similar  but not necessarily always as stringent and detailed  requirements as in the us concerning water resources and the protection of water quality  including those that regulate the discharge of pollutants and other harmful substances into water  require permits  impose clean up obligations for spills and releases and impose fines and penalties for non compliance 
however  these countries continue to implement stricter requirements that approach the requirements in the us air emissions our operations are subject to the federal clean air act  as amended  and comparable state and local laws  as well as the federal  provincial and local canadian  uk  european union and mexican laws applicable to our canadian  uk and mexican operations  although not necessarily always as stringent as found in the us  at least not presently 
these laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various sources  including certain of our plants  compression stations and other facilities  and impose various monitoring and reporting requirements 
pursuant to these laws and regulations  we may be required to obtain environmental agency pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions  obtain and comply with the terms of air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions 
we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment and leak detection and monitoring systems in connection with obtaining or maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions 
there are significant potential monetary fines for violating air emission standards and permit provisions 
semcams conducts on going air  soil and ground water monitoring in accordance with license requirements 
semcams is required to annually report all specified emissions from its major facilities to a publically accessible national pollutant release inventory database 
sour gas semcams operates facilities which process and transport sour gas gas containing hydrogen sulfide  generally at concentrations of parts per million or more 
due to the highly toxic and corrosive nature of sour gas  sour gas handling is regulated in canada  at both the provincial and federal level  from the wellhead to the point of disposal of the sulfur content removed from processing the sour gas 
environmental legislation can also affect the operations of facilities and limit the extent to which facility expansion is permitted 
proposed facilities are facing increased resistance from community groups which are  in turn  increasing demand for alternate sources of sweetening 
in addition  legislation requires that facility sites be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of provincial authorities and local landowners 
a breach of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and the issuance of clean up orders 
to protect the public  pipelines transporting sour gas are required to be equipped with monitoring stations and valves that automatically shut down the flow of the pipeline in response to sudden changes in pressure or detection of sour gas in the atmosphere 
semcams sour gas pipelines are monitored hours per day from a centralized pipeline control center and can be shut down by the attending operators 
the distance between automatic pipeline valves is determined  based on regulated sour gas dispersion modeling  to meet approved emergency protection zone size and public exposure requirements 
the integrity of the sour gas pipelines is maintained through the injection of corrosion inhibition chemicals on an on going basis 
semcams sour gas pipelines are inspected on a regular basis to ensure the integrity of the pipelines and associated facilities 
semcams sour gas plants have continuous sour gas detection equipment  as well as other safety systems which can automatically shut down and depressure the full plant to a controlled flare system 
the plants are attended hours per day and can also be shut down by attending operators 

table of contents at semcams sour gas processing plants  sulfur recovery and air quality are constantly monitored to ensure required sulfur recovery and emission standards are met 
existing regulations require a sliding range of recovery depending on throughput 
semcams required sulfur recovery ranges vary from to  operational history has shown actual recovery above license requirements at to 
residual sulfur that cannot be removed by processing is incinerated to meet a minimum stack top temperature based on a regulator approved dispersion model 
climate change in response to concerns suggesting that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases ghgs including carbon dioxide co and methane  are contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes  the united states congress has been considering legislation to reduce such emissions 
in addition  more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state regional initiatives  have already begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or ghg cap and trade programs 
as an alternative to cap and trade programs  congress may consider the implementation of a carbon tax program 
the cap and trade programs could require major sources of emissions  such as electric power plants  or major producers of fuels  such as refineries or ngl fractionation plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances 
depending on the particular program and scope thereof  we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for ghg emissions resulting from our operations 
depending on the design and implementation of carbon tax programs  our operations could face additional taxes and higher cost of doing business 
although we would not be impacted to a greater degree than other similarly situated midstream energy service providers  a stringent ghg control program could have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and could reduce demand for the natural gas and ngls we gather and process 
on december   the us environmental protection agency the epa  issued a notice of its final finding and determination that emissions of co  methane  and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
this final finding and determination allows the epa to begin regulating ghg emissions under existing provisions of the clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has adopted regulations that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and also trigger permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
in addition  the epa issued a final rule  effective in december  requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us  beginning in for emissions occurring in epa s greenhouse gas reporting program ghgrp 
further  on november   epa finalized new ghg reporting requirements for upstream petroleum and natural gas systems  which will be added to epa s ghg reporting rule 
facilities containing petroleum and natural gas systems that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalent per year will be required to report annual ghg emissions to epa  with the first report due on march  in december  the epa issued three concurrent actions related to its ghgrp which require the collection of certain additional business related data  and therefore  it is deferring the reporting of certain information 
in march  the us house of representatives energy and power subcommittee passed the energy tax prevention act of hr  which would prevent the epa from regulating greenhouse gases for the purpose of addressing climate change 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business  any such new federal  state or regional restrictions on emissions of co that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could also have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and demand for the petroleum products we gather  process  transport  store  distribute and market 
semcams has been required to file provincial ghg emissions reports annually since for its three large gas plants 
ghg baselines were set based on through data 
alberta facilities that emit more than  tonnes of ghg per year have to reduce emissions intensity by percent 
companies can meet this 
table of contents obligation through improvements to their operations  by purchasing alberta based credits  by contributing to the climate change and emissions management fund or any combination thereof 
beginning with the last half of the reporting year  penalties cdn per tonne are paid to the provincial government when the ghg intensity ghg emissions per unit of production are greater than of the intensity established in the baseline data 
all ghg costs paid by semcams are recovered by allocation to the producers based on fuel gas use and co composition in the inlet gas 
failure to comply with the regulation will result in a fine of for every tonne of co by which the total release of specified gases exceeds the net emissions intensity limit for the facility 
legislation to further lower the current reporting limit is pending which  if enacted  would require additional semcams facilities to file provincial ghg emissions reports annually 
hazardous substances and wastes the environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils  groundwater and surface water  and include measures to prevent and control pollution 
these laws and regulations generally regulate the generation  storage  treatment  transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes  and may require investigatory and corrective actions at facilities where such waste may have been released or disposed 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state laws  impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that contributed to a release of hazardous substance into the environment 
potentially responsible persons can include the current owner or operator of the site where a release previously occurred and companies that disposed  or arranged for the disposal  of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some cases  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the potentially responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other wastes released into the environment 
although petroleum  as well as natural gas and ngls  have been for the most part excluded from cercla s definition of a hazardous substance  in the course of ordinary operations  we may generate wastes that may fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
in addition  there are other laws and regulations that can create liability for releases of petroleum  natural gas or ngls 
moreover  we may be responsible under cercla or other laws for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
we have received notification that we are one of four companies that may be potentially responsible for any cleanup costs required under the state of washington s cercla equivalent statute with respect to a site in spokane  washington as result of the our having leased the site after the contamination occurred 
no clean up has yet been ordered 
our position is that  as a result of our emergence from the bankruptcy  any potential claims against us for regulatory agency oversight costs were converted to administrative priority claims and any potential claims against us for investigation and clean up costs were converted to unsecured claims as they relate to other potentially responsible persons and to administrative priority claims as they relate to any regulatory agency 
we also generate  and may in the future generate  both hazardous and nonhazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and or comparable state laws 
we are not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the rcra requirements because our operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes as currently defined under rcra 
from time to time  the epa and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes  including crude oil and natural gas wastes 
moreover  it is possible that some wastes generated by us that are currently classified as nonhazardous may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes  resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly management and disposal requirements 
changes in applicable laws or regulations may result in an increase in our capital expenditures  facility operating expenses or otherwise impose limits or restrictions on our operations 

table of contents national  provincial and local laws of canada  mexico  the uk and the european union that are applicable to our operations also regulate the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils  groundwater and surface water  and include measures to prevent and control pollution as well as the handling of hazardous waste 
some of the requirements are similar to those found under cercla and rcra and some are not yet as stringent  but are becoming more so as the focus on these issues increases 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  and in the future we may own or lease  properties that have been used over the years for petroleum product operations 
solid waste disposal practices within the oil and natural gas and related industries have improved over the years with the passage and implementation of various environmental laws and regulations 
nevertheless  some petroleum products and other solid wastes have been disposed of on  or under  various properties owned or leased by us during the operating history of those facilities 
in addition  a number of these properties may have been operated by third parties over whom we had no control as to such entities handling of petroleum products or other wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed of or released 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws  we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination  including groundwater contamination  or to take action to prevent future contamination 
in some instances  any such requirements may have been dealt with in the bankruptcy proceeding 
employee safety we are subject to the requirements of osha  as well as to comparable national  state  provincial and local  canadian  mexican  uk and european union laws that are applicable to our canadian  mexican and uk operations  the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard and comparable state  canadian federal and provincial statutes require us to organize and disclose information concerning hazardous materials used  produced or transported in our operations 
some of our facilities are subject to the osha process safety management regulations that are designated to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic  reactive  flammable or explosive chemicals 
semcams facilities are also subject to regulation by absa 
semcams maintains its own compliance program  audited by absa  which addresses integrity  inspection and process safety management elements as required by legislation 
hazardous materials transportation requirements the dot regulations affecting pipeline safety require pipeline operators to implement measures designed to reduce the environmental impact of oil discharge from onshore oil pipelines 
these regulations require operators to maintain comprehensive spill response plans  including extensive spill response training for pipeline personnel 
in addition  the dot regulations contain detailed specifications for pipeline operation and maintenance 
similar requirements are in effect in canada 
anti terrorism measures the federal department of homeland security appropriations act of requires the department of homeland security dhs  to issue regulations establishing risk based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities  including oil and gas facilities that are deemed to present high levels of security risk 
the dhs issued an interim final rule in april regarding risk based performance standards to be attained pursuant to this act and  on november   further issued an appendix a to the interim rules that establish chemicals of interest and their respective threshold quantities that will trigger compliance with the interim rules 
to the extent our facilities are subject to existing or new rules  it is possible that the costs to comply with such rules could be substantial 

table of contents title to properties substantially all of our pipelines are constructed on rights of way granted by the record owners of the property 
lands over which pipeline rights of way have been obtained may be subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right of way grants 
we have obtained  where necessary  easement agreements from public authorities and railroad companies to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along  watercourses  county roads  municipal streets  railroad properties and state highways  as applicable 
in some cases  property on which our pipeline was built was purchased in fee 
our processing plants and terminals are on real property owned or leased by us 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of the assets we own 
although title to such properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property  liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations  liens for current taxes and other burdens and minor easements  restrictions and other encumbrances to which the underlying properties were subject at the time of acquisition by us  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of such properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business 
office facilities in addition to our gathering  storage  terminalling and processing facilities discussed above  we maintain corporate office headquarters located in tulsa  oklahoma 
all of the us business segments utilize tulsa as their center of operations  except for crude  whose primary operations are located in oklahoma city 
foreign business segments utilize their centers of operations  which are calgary  alberta for semcams  puebla  mexico for semmexico  and milford haven  wales for semlogistics 
many of our business segments also have satellite offices located throughout north america 
the current lease for our tulsa headquarters expires in may  and the other office leases have varying expiration dates 
while we may require additional office space as our business expands  we believe that our existing facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future  and that additional facilities will be available on commercially reasonable terms as needed 
employees as of december   we had approximately employees  including approximately employees outside the us in canada  mexico and the uk approximately of our employees in canada and mexico are represented by labor unions and subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us 
of that number  approximately employees have collective bargaining agreements that will expire in and approximately with collective bargaining agreements expiring in we have never had a labor related work stoppage and believe our employee relations are good

these covenants and restrictions limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us 
for example  our credit facilities limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends over a certain amount  make certain restricted payments  consummate certain asset sales  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and merge  consolidate and or sell or dispose of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facilities  or any other such subsequent financing agreements  may result in an event of default 
an event of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the repayment of the related debt  as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facilities when due  the lenders thereunder could  subject to the terms of the relevant agreements  seek to sell or otherwise transfer our assets granted to them as collateral to secure the indebtedness outstanding under those facilities 
substantially all of our assets have been pledged as collateral to secure our credit facilities 
in addition  the lenders under our revolving credit facilities may choose to terminate any commitments they then have made to supply us with further funds 
under certain economic conditions  our access to credit markets may be limited  which may adversely impact our liquidity 
we may require additional capital from outside sources from time to time 
our ability to arrange financing or renew existing facilities  along with the cost of such capital  is dependent upon a number of variables  including general economic  financial and business conditions  industry specific conditions  credit availability from banks and other financial institutions  investor confidence in us  
table of contents cash flow and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization levels  competitive  legislative and regulatory matters  and provisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital 
in addition  volatility in the capital markets may adversely affect our ability to access any available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities 
our access to these funds is dependent on the ability of the lenders to meet their funding obligations under these revolving facilities 
lenders may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity  resulting in a reduction of our available borrowing capacity 
our cash flow depends in part on the available cash and distributions of rose rock 
our partnership interests in rose rock are significant cash generating assets 
therefore  our cash flow is dependent to some extent upon the ability of rose rock to make a minimum quarterly distribution to its unitholders  including us 
rose rock may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable it to pay the minimum quarterly distribution  which would have a corresponding negative impact on us 
the amount of cash rose rock can distribute on its units principally depends upon the amount of cash it generates from its operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the price of crude oil and the level of production of  and demand for  crude oil in the markets it serves  the volume of crude oil that it gathers  transports  stores and markets  the fees with respect to volumes that it handles  the profitability of its marketing operations  damage to pipelines  facilities  related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes  floods  fires  severe weather  explosions and other natural disasters and acts of terrorism or inadvertent damage to pipelines from construction  farm and utility equipment  leaks or accidental releases of crude oil or other materials into the environment  whether as a result of human error or otherwise  demand charges and volumetric fees associated with its transportation services  the level of competition from other midstream energy companies  the level of its operating  maintenance and general and administrative costs  regulatory action affecting the supply of or demand for crude oil  the rates it can charge  how it contracts for services  its existing contracts  its operating costs or its operating flexibility  changes in tax laws  and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  the actual amount of cash rose rock will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond its control  including the level of capital expenditures it makes  the cost of acquisitions  its debt service requirements and other liabilities  fluctuations in its working capital needs  its ability to borrow funds and access capital markets  restrictions contained in debt agreements to which it is a party  and 
table of contents the amount of cash reserves established by its general partner

our operations could be adversely affected if third party pipelines or other facilities interconnected to our facilities become partially or fully unavailable  or if the volumes we gather do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities 
our facilities connect to other pipelines or facilities  some of which are owned by third parties 
the continuing operation of such third party pipelines or facilities is not within our control 
these pipelines and other facilities may become unavailable because of testing  turnarounds  line repair  reduced operating pressure  lack of operating capacity  curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity  or for any other reason 
if any of these pipelines or facilities becomes unable to transport the products we gather  or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
as a public company  we are subject to financial and other reporting and corporate governance requirements that may be difficult for us to satisfy  will raise our costs  and may divert resources and management attention from operating our business 
following the effectiveness of our registration statement on form in november  we are required to file with the sec annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in the exchange act and sec regulations 
thus  we need to ensure that we maintain the ability to prepare  on a timely basis  reports that comply with sec requirements 
we are also subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements  including the listing standards of the nyse  the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of and the regulations promulgated thereunder 
the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting must be assessed by management and audited by an independent registered public accounting firm each year 
if we are unable to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or otherwise to comply with section  we may be unable to report financial information on a timely basis  may suffer adverse regulatory consequences  may have violations of the nyse listing rules and may breach covenants under our credit facilities 
there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements 
the changes necessitated by becoming a public company require a significant commitment of resources and management oversight that increase our costs and may strain our systems and resources 
as a result  our management s attention might be diverted from other business concerns 
in addition  we might not be totally successful in maintaining controls and procedures that comply with these requirements 
if we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment or to comply fully with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements imposed on public companies  we could make material errors in  and be required to restate  our financial statements 
any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the sec 
our comprehensive risk management policy s provisions governing our internal trading and marketing activities cannot eliminate all risks associated with the trading and marketing of commodities  nor can we ensure full compliance at all times with the comprehensive risk management policy by our employees  both of which could impact our financial and operational results 
we have in place a comprehensive risk management policy that establishes authorized commodities and transaction types  delegations of authority  and limits for trading and marketing exposures and requires that we 
table of contents restrict net open positions eg  positions that are not fully hedged as to commodity price risk to specified levels at each of the consolidated and  in certain cases  subsidiary level 
our risk management policy has restrictive terms with respect to acquiring and holding physical inventory  futures contracts or derivative products for the purpose of proprietary trading activity 
these policies and practices  however  cannot eliminate all risks 
if we enter into derivatives contracts or sale contracts for the delivery of products at a future date  we are subject to the risk of non delivery under product purchase contracts or the failure of gathering and transportation systems 
for example  any event that disrupts our anticipated physical supply of products could create a net open position that would expose us to risk of loss resulting from price changes 
moreover  we are exposed to price movements on products that are not hedged  including certain of our inventory  such as linefill  which must be maintained to operate pipeline and gathering lines 
we are also exposed to certain price risks that cannot be readily hedged  such as price risks for basis differentials 
basis differentials can be created to the extent that our purchase or sales contracts call for delivery of a petroleum product of a grade  at a location  or at a time that differs from the specific delivery terms of offsetting purchase and sales agreements or derivative instruments 
if this occurs  we may not be able to use the physical or derivative commodity markets to fully hedge our price risk 
even though we expect to maintain only limited net open positions  as permitted under the comprehensive risk management policy  we will be exposed to price risks within predefined limits and authorizations which could impact our operational and financial results 
we also have a risk that employees involved in our trading and marketing operations may not comply at all times with the risk management policy 
even with management oversight  we cannot ensure with certainty that all violations of the risk management policy  particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved  will be detected prior to our businesses being materially affected 
conventional gas operations face increased competitive pressure from shale gas production 
the us energy information administration reports that higher estimates of domestic shale gas resources support increasing estimates of domestic natural gas production at prices below its previous estimates 
the abundant supply of shale gas places pressure on all conventional gas production including sour gas production 
in addition  facilities designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from a raw gas stream face increased pressure because sour gas is more expensive to process than gas which does not contain sulfur 
our construction of new assets is subject to regulatory  environmental  political  legal and economic risks which could adversely affect our business 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new assets 
the construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and of new assets involves numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties beyond our control 
in addition  the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights of way prior to constructing new pipelines 
we may be unable to obtain such rights of way to connect new petroleum product supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities 
additionally  it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way 
if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights of way increases  or if we lose our existing rights of way through our inability to renew right of way contracts or otherwise  our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
actual results may vary significantly from the projections filed with the us bankruptcy court 
in connection with our plan of reorganization  we were required to prepare projected financial information to demonstrate to the us bankruptcy court the feasibility of our plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from the bankruptcy 
those projections are included in the disclosure 
table of contents statement filed with the us bankruptcy court on september  those projections are not included in this report on form k  are not incorporated by reference into this report on form k  and they should not be relied upon 
those projections were based on numerous assumptions about our anticipated future performance and were based on anticipated market and economic conditions that were  and remain  beyond our control or inconsistent with current strategy 
projections are inherently subject to many uncertainties and a wide variety of significant business  economic and competitive risks 
our actual results of operations and financial condition will vary from those contemplated by the projections and the variations may be material 
because our consolidated financial statements reflect fresh start reporting adjustments made upon emergence from our bankruptcy reorganization  and because of the effects of the transactions that became effective pursuant to our plan of reorganization  financial information in our current and future financial statements will not be comparable to our financial information from prior periods 
in connection with our bankruptcy reorganization  we adopted fresh start reporting effective as of the close of business on november   in accordance with the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc  reorganizations 
our adoption of fresh start reporting resulted in our becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes 
as required by fresh start reporting  our assets and liabilities have been adjusted to reflect fair value at november  in addition to fresh start reporting  our financial statements reflect the effects of all of the transactions implemented by our plan of reorganization 
accordingly  our financial statements for periods ending on or prior to november   are not comparable with our financial statements for periods ending subsequent to november  furthermore  the estimates and assumptions used to implement fresh start reporting are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot provide assurance that the estimates  assumptions  and values reflected in our valuations will be realized  and our actual results could vary materially 
an impairment of goodwill could reduce our earnings 
we recorded million of goodwill at november   in connection with fresh start reporting 
goodwill was recorded to the extent that the company s reorganization value exceeded amounts attributed to specific tangible or identified intangible assets 
accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap require us to test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill might be impaired 
if we were to determine that any of our goodwill was impaired  we would be required to take an immediate charge to earnings 
during we revised downward our projections of the future earnings potential of the semcanada crude segment  following a significant loss of customers  coupled with a significant decline in profitability and an assessment by a national consultancy that certain market conditions that are adversely impacting this segment were likely to continue 
in response to these events  we tested semcanada crude s goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as of march  based on the results of these tests  we recorded an impairment loss of million  representing the full amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets attributable to semcanada crude 
also during  we sold the property  plant and equipment of the semcanada crude segment and began winding down its operations 
also during  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test 
we concluded that the goodwill attributable to our semmexico segment was impaired  due primarily to lower than expected demand for asphalt resulting from a slowdown of road construction in mexico 
we recorded a loss of million related to this impairment 
during  we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test  and concluded that the goodwill and other intangible assets related to our semstream arizona business were impaired 
we recorded a loss of million related to this impairment 
in addition  we concluded that the goodwill related to our semlogistics business was impaired and  accordingly  recorded an impairment loss of million 

table of contents changes in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our operating results 
a portion of our revenue is generated from our operations in canada  the uk and mexico  which use the canadian dollar  british pound and mexican peso  respectively  as the functional currency 
therefore  changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and any of such foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial and operational results 
we are exposed to the creditworthiness and performance of our customers  suppliers and transactional counterparties  and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by one or more of these parties could adversely affect our financial and operational results 
there can be no assurance we have adequately assessed the creditworthiness of each of our existing or future customers  suppliers or transactional counterparties or that there will not be a rapid or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness  which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
there is no certainty that our counterparties will perform or adhere to existing or future contractual arrangements 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis and credit monitoring procedures and policies  including credit support requirements for customers and counterparties to which we extend no or limited unsecured credit  such as letters of credit  prepayments  and guarantees 
however  these procedures and policies cannot fully eliminate counterparty credit risks  and to the extent our procedures and policies prove to be inadequate  our financial and operational results may be negatively impacted 
some of our counterparties may be highly leveraged or have limited financial resources and will be subject to their own operating and regulatory risks and  even if our credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly  we may experience financial losses in our dealings with such parties 
in addition  volatility in commodity prices might have an impact on many of our counterparties  which  in turn  could have a negative impact on their ability to meet their obligations to us and may also increase the magnitude of these obligations 
any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our counterparties could require us to pursue substitute counterparties for the affected operations  reduce operations or provide alternative services 
there can be no assurance that any such efforts would be successful or would provide similar financial and operational results 
our business involves many hazards and operational risks  some of which may not be covered by insurance 
sudden leaks are possible in operations involving pipelines and tanks 
other possible operating risks include the breakdown or failure of equipment  information systems or processes  the performance of equipment at levels below those originally intended whether due to misuse  unexpected degradation or design  construction or manufacturing defects  failure to maintain adequate inventories of spare parts  operator error  labor disputes  disputes with interconnected facilities and carriers  and catastrophic events such as natural disasters  fires  explosions  fractures  acts of terrorism and other similar events  many of which are beyond our control 
these risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life  severe damage to  and destruction of  property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage  and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations 
we are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business 
in addition  as a result of market conditions  premiums for our insurance could increase significantly 
in some instances  insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
if a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured  it could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
even if a significant accident or event is covered by insurance  we may still have responsibility for applicable deductibles  and in addition  the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner 

table of contents any acquisition involves risks that may adversely affect our business 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including performance from the acquired businesses or assets that is below the forecasts we used in evaluating the acquisition  a significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements  the inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets  the incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets  including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets prior to our acquisition  risks associated with operating in lines of business that are distinct and separate from our historical operations  loss of customers or key employees from the acquired businesses  and the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from our acquisitions  realize other anticipated benefits and meet our debt service requirements 
we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the us the success of our business depends  in part  on continued performance in our non us operations 
we currently have operations in canada  mexico and the uk in addition to the other risks described in this report on form k  there are numerous risks and uncertainties that specifically affect our non us operations 
these risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability  changes in local governmental laws  regulations and policies  including those related to tariffs  investments  taxation  exchange controls  employment regulations and repatriation of earnings  and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights 
international transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs  including risks of non compliance with us and local laws affecting our activities abroad  including compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act and the us bribery act of while these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict  any one or more of them could adversely affect our financial and operational results 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity programs and related repairs 
pursuant to the pipeline safety improvement act of  as reauthorized and amended by the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement and safety act of  the dot  through the dot s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration  has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm in high consequence areas  including high population areas  areas that are sources of drinking water  ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release and commercially navigable waterways  unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area 
the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement and safety act of expired on september   and was operating under the continuing resolution that expired on march  the reauthorization of the pipeline safety act being considered by congress could result in new and more costly compliance requirements 
current regulations require operators of covered pipelines to perform on going assessments of pipeline integrity on a recurring frequency schedule  identify and characterize applicable potential threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area  
table of contents improve data collection  integration and analysis  repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary  and implement preventive and mitigating actions 
in addition  states have adopted regulations similar to existing dot regulations for intrastate gathering and transmission lines 
we currently estimate that we will incur an aggregate cost of approximately million for years through to implement necessary pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of our pipelines required by existing dot and state regulations 
this estimate does not include the costs  if any  of any repair  remediation  preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program  which costs could be substantial 
at this time  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these regulations  as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity testing 
following the initial round of testing and repairs  we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs on an on going basis to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines 
the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operations of our pipelines and  consequently  result in a reduction in our revenue and cash flows from shutting down our pipelines during the pendency of such repairs or upgrades 
some of our operations cross the us canada border and are subject to cross border regulation 
our cross border activities with our canadian subsidiaries and certain customers subject us to regulatory matters  including import and export licenses  tariffs  canadian and us customs and tax issues and toxic substance certifications 
such regulations include the short supply controls of the export administration act  the north american free trade agreement and the toxic substances control act 
violations of these licensing  tariff and tax reporting requirements could result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits from our recent acquisition of a significant equity position in ngl energy partners lp 
on november   semstream completed the sale of substantially all of its assets to ngl supply terminal company llc  a subsidiary of ngl energy  in exchange for  among other things   common units of the common units outstanding at december  representing limited partnership interests in ngl energy the ngl common units 
ngl energy owns and operates a vertically integrated propane business with three operating segments midstream  wholesale supply and marketing  and retail propane 
we do not control ngl energy s assets and operations and the value of  and benefits from  our investment in the ngl common units are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties inherent in ngl energy s business including  without limitation  the following ngl energy may not have sufficient cash to enable it to pay minimum quarterly distributions on its common units  including the ngl common units  the amount of cash ngl energy has available for distribution to its unitholders  including us  depends primarily on its cash flow rather than on its profitability  which may prevent it from making distributions  even during periods in which it realizes net income  current conditions in the global capital and credit markets  and general economic pressures  may adversely affect ngl energy s financial position and results of operations  widely fluctuating propane prices could adversely affect ngl energy s ability to finance its working capital needs  
table of contents if ngl energy does not successfully identify acquisition candidates  complete accretive acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or adequately integrate the acquired operations into its existing operations  its future financial performance may be adversely affected and its growth may be limited  increases in interest rates could adversely impact ngl energy s common unit price  its ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes  and its ability to make cash distributions at its intended levels  ngl energy s operations are subject to all the operating hazards and risks incident to handling  storing  transporting  and providing customers with combustible liquids such as propane  ngl energy s partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of ngl energy s general partner to ngl energy s unitholders  including us  and restricts the remedies available to the unitholders for actions taken by its general partner that might otherwise be breaches of fiduciary duty  cost reimbursements to ngl energy s general partner may be substantial and could reduce its cash available to make quarterly distributions on the common units  including the ngl common units  ngl energy s partnership agreement requires that ngl energy distribute all of its available cash  which could limit its ability to grow and make acquisitions  and other factors discussed in ngl energy s annual report on form k and as are included from time to time in ngl energy s public announcements and other filings with the sec 
as part of our transaction with ngl energy  we waived ordinary course cash distributions from ngl energy on  of the ngl common units the distribution waiver units until august  we may not transfer or sell any of the distribution waiver units prior to september   unless the purchaser of these units enters into a forbearance agreement with ngl energy relating to the units purchased 
when these restrictions end  to the extent that we desire to sell any of the ngl common units  our ability to sell units could be severely limited  both as to timing and amount  and as a result of factors beyond our control 
also  the market price of the ngl common units may decline substantially before we sell the units 
for the reasons described above  we may not realize an adequate return on our investment and we may incur losses on any sales of our investment 
in addition  our equity in earnings or losses of ngl energy will be reported in our consolidated statement of operations  which could result in volatility in our earnings 
future declines in the fair value of our investment in ngl energy could  under certain circumstances  require us to record impairment losses on our investment 
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of a publicly traded limited partnership  rose rock 
as such  this subsidiary s operations may involve a greater risk of liability than ordinary business operations 
one of our subsidiaries acts as the general partner of rose rock  a publicly traded limited partnership 
this subsidiary may be deemed to have undertaken fiduciary obligations with respect to rose rock as the general partner and to the limited partners of rose rock 
activities determined to involve fiduciary obligations to other persons or entities typically involve a higher standard of conduct than ordinary business operations and therefore may involve a greater risk of liability  particularly when a conflict of interests is found to exist 
our control of the general partner of rose rock may increase the possibility of claims of breach of fiduciary duties  including claims brought due to conflicts of interest including conflicts of interest that may arise between rose rock  on the one hand  and its general partner and that general partner s affiliates  including us  on the other hand 
any liability resulting from such claims could be material 
a prolonged decline in index prices at cushing relative to other index prices could reduce the demand for our transportation to  and storage in  cushing 
shifts in the overall supply of  and demand for  crude oil in regional  national and global markets  over which we have no control  can have an adverse impact on crude oil index prices in the markets we serve relative 
table of contents to other index prices 
for example  cushing has experienced a shortfall in takeaway pipeline capacity  which has in turn led to an oversupply of crude oil at cushing 
this has been cited as a principal reason for the decline in the west texas intermediate index wti index price used at cushing relative to other crude oil price indexes  including the brent crude index 
a prolonged decline in the wti index price relative to other index prices may cause reduced demand for our transportation to  and storage in  cushing  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
adverse developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
our operations are focused on gathering  transporting  storing  processing  and treating petroleum products utilizing our assets which are principally located in the midwest and rocky mountain supply region of the us and in alberta  canada 
as a result  our results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition depend upon the demand for our services in these regions 
due to our current lack of broad diversification in industry type and geographic location  adverse developments in our current segment of the midstream industry  or our existing areas of operation  could have a significantly greater impact on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition than if our operations were more diversified 
the nature and degree of regulation may adversely affect fee structures or operations 
our operations are subject to substantial regulation from foreign and domestic federal  state  provincial and local authorities 
these authorities regulate numerous aspects of our operations  including our interstate natural gas storage operations  certain crude oil gathering systems  construction and maintenance of facilities  and certain rate structures among other things 
we cannot predict the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws and regulations applicable to our businesses 
revisions  interpretation changes or additional regulations could influence our operating environment and may result in increased costs 
white cliffs pipeline is subject to ferc rules and regulations 
the ferc s regulatory authority extends to transportation of crude oil in interstate commerce  rates  operating terms and conditions of service  accounts and records  and depreciation and amortization policies 
regulatory actions in these areas can similarly affect new or expanded pipeline operations 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances  petroleum products or wastes into the environment 
our operations are subject to federal and foreign  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws include  for example federal and comparable state and foreign laws that impose obligations related to air emissions  federal and comparable state and foreign laws that impose requirements for the handling  storage  treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities  federal and comparable state and foreign laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for disposal  and 
table of contents federal and comparable state and foreign laws that regulate discharges of wastewater from our facilities require spill protection planning and preparation and set requirements for other actions for protection of waters 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or newly adopted laws or regulations  may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
claims pursued under certain environmental laws impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or petroleum products have been disposed or otherwise released 
provisions also exist that may require remediation or other compensation to pay for damages to natural resources 
moreover  it is not uncommon for individuals to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances  petroleum products or waste products in the environment 
there is an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of crude oil and natural gas  air emissions and water discharges related to our operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
for example  an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities for environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by individuals for personal injury  natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
we may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance and fines or penalties paid for compliance violations  whether alleged or proven  will not be covered by insurance 
derivatives regulations included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices and interest rates 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act was passed by congress and signed into law 
the act contains significant derivatives regulations  including a requirement that certain transactions be cleared on exchanges and a requirement to post cash collateral commonly referred to as margin for such transactions 
the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end users and includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and the parties to those transactions 
the act requires the commodity futures trading commission the cftc to promulgate rules to define these terms  however  we neither know the rules the cftc will promulgate nor the definitions that will apply to us 
we use crude oil and other energy derivative instruments in connection with our crude activities  and may use natural gas related derivative instruments in connection with our semgas activities  principally to hedge the commodity price risk associated with these businesses 
we may also use energy derivatives in conjunction with the activities of our other businesses and may use interest rate derivative instruments to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations associated with our debt 
at present  we post collateral with clearing brokers with respect to substantially all our commitments and potential obligations under these derivative instruments 
depending on the regulations adopted by the cftc  we may be required to post additional collateral for our energy and interest rate derivative transactions in excess of present levels 
such a requirement is not anticipated to have a significant impact on our business  but may increase costs and decrease profitability 
moreover  a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral could result in additional costs being passed on to us  thereby decreasing our profitability 

table of contents our storage operations are influenced by the overall forward market for crude oil  and certain market conditions may adversely affect our financial and operating results 
our storage operations are influenced by the overall forward market for crude oil 
a contango market meaning that the price of crude oil for future delivery is higher than the current price is associated with greater demand for crude oil storage capacity  because a party can simultaneously purchase crude oil at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery 
a backwardated market meaning that the price of crude oil for future delivery is lower than the current price is associated with lower demand for crude oil storage capacity  because a party can capture a premium for prompt delivery of crude oil rather than storing it for future sale 
a prolonged backwardated market or other adverse market conditions could have an adverse impact on our ability to negotiate favorable prices under new or renewing storage contracts  which could have an adverse impact on our storage revenues 
finally  higher absolute levels of crude oil prices increase the costs of financing and insuring crude oil in storage  which negatively affects storage economics 
as a result  the overall forward market for crude oil may have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
an increase in interest rates could impact demand for our storage capacity 
there is a financing cost for a storage capacity user to own crude oil while it is stored 
that financing cost is impacted by the cost of capital or interest rate incurred by the storage user in addition to the commodity cost of the crude oil in inventory 
absent other factors  a higher financing cost adversely impacts the economics of storing crude oil for future sale 
as a result  a significant increase in interest rates could adversely affect the demand for our storage capacity independent of other market factors 
we are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies  which could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business activities are subject to regulation by multiple federal  state and local governmental agencies 
our historical and projected operating costs reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations  and we do not anticipate material expenditures in excess of these amounts in the absence of future acquisitions  or changes in regulation  or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues 
additional proposals and proceedings that affect the midstream industry are regularly considered by congress  as well as by state legislatures and federal and state regulatory commissions  agencies and courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on our business 
however  additions to the regulatory burden on our industry generally increase our cost of doing business and affect our profitability 
climate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services 
in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in anticipation of those findings  the epa had previously proposed regulations that would require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and that could lead to the imposition of ghg emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  the epa issued a final rule  effective in december  requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large ghg emission sources in the us  beginning in for emissions occurring in in march  the epa proposed revisions to these reporting requirements to apply to all oil and gas production  transmission  processing and other facilities exceeding certain emission thresholds 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with 
table of contents our operations or could adversely affect demand for the petroleum products we gather  treat or otherwise handle in connection with our services 
in march  the us house of representatives energy and power subcommittee passed the energy tax prevention act of hr  which would prevent the epa from regulating greenhouse gases for the purpose of addressing climate change 
however  both president obama and the administrator of the epa have repeatedly indicated their preference for comprehensive legislation to address this issue and create the framework for a clean energy economy  with the obama administration supporting an emission allowance system 
past proposed legislation in congress has included an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce ghg emissions 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business  any such new federal  state or regional restrictions on emission of co that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could also have an adverse effect on our cost of doing business and demand for the petroleum products we gather process  transport  store  distribute and market 
some states are also looking at similar types of laws and regulations 
if one or more states in which our operations are located were to adopt such laws and implement ghgs programs and or cap and trade programs  we could incur increased operating costs and or face decreased demand for our services 
canada does not currently have any federal legislation pending relating to the regulation of ghg emissions 
it is widely expected that canadian federal legislation will be proposed and voted on in the next couple of years once the us ghg mechanisms are decided 
the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the petroleum products we gather  treat or otherwise handle in connection with our services 
although canada has not yet enacted federal ghg legislation  the province of alberta has set ghg baselines based on data which requires a reduction of in ghg emissions intensity from certain facilities  including several of semcams facilities 
beginning with the second half of  penalties are assessed for failure to comply with required reductions 
further limitations may be imposed in the future which could require additional semcams facilities to have to file annual ghg emissions reports 
the potential increase in the costs of our operations resulting from any legislation or regulation to restrict emissions of ghgs could include new or increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities  install new emission controls on our facilities  acquire allowances to authorize our ghg emissions  pay any taxes related to our ghg emissions and administer and manage a ghg emissions program 
while we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our pipelines or other facilities  such recovery of costs is uncertain 
moreover  incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for petroleum products  resulting in a decrease in the demand for our services 
loss of key employees can significantly reduce capability to execute strategies 
much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including the executive team and skilled employees in technical  operational and staff positions 
experienced personnel in the midstream industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is high 
we depend on current and new key officers and employees to meet the challenges and complexities of our businesses 
if any such officers or employees resign  or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced  or if we are unable to fill currently vacant positions  our business operations could be materially adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain key personnel 

table of contents the threat or attack of terrorists aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business 
since the september  terrorist attacks  the us government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically the nation s pipeline infrastructure  may be future targets of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any future terrorist attack that may target our facilities  those of our customers or those of certain other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our businesses 
in addition  any governmental body mandated actions to prepare for  or protect against  potential terrorist attacks could require us to expend money or modify our operations 
we face intense competition in our gathering  transportation  storage and marketing activities 
competition from other providers of those services that are able to supply our customers with those services at a lower price or on otherwise better terms could adversely affect our business and operating results 
we are subject to competition from other gathering  transportation  storage and marketing operations that may be able to supply our customers with the same or comparable services at a lower price or otherwise on better terms 
we compete with national  regional and local gathering  transportation and storage companies of widely varying sizes  financial resources and experience  including the major integrated oil companies 
our ability to compete could be harmed by numerous factors  including price competition  the perception that another company can provide better service  a reluctance to contract with us due to our bankruptcy filing  and the availability of alternative supply points  or supply points located closer to the operations of our customers 
some of our competitors have greater financial  managerial and other resources than we do  and control substantially more storage or transportation capacity than we do 
our competitors may expand their assets or operations  creating additional competition for the services we provide to our customers 
in addition  our customers may develop their own gathering  transportation and storage systems or marketing operations in lieu of using ours 
our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers 
our profitability depends on the demand for the products we gather  transport  process and store in the markets we serve 
any sustained reduction in demand for petroleum products in markets served by our midstream assets could result in a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum products that we gather  transport  process and store  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
a reduction in demand can result from a number of factors including an increase in the price of products derived from petroleum products  higher taxes  including federal excise taxes  crude oil severance taxes or sales taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase  directly or indirectly  the cost of petroleum and natural gas based products  adverse economic conditions which result in lower spending by consumers and businesses on products derived from petroleum products  higher fuel taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase the cost of the products we handle  effects of weather  natural phenomena  terrorism  war  or other similar acts  
table of contents an increase in fuel economy  whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel efficient vehicles  technological advances by manufacturers or federal or state regulations  decision by our customers or suppliers to use alternate service providers for a portion of all of their needs  operate in different markets not served by us  reduce operations or cease operations entirely  and an increase in the use of alternative fuel sources such as ethanol  biodiesel  fuel cells  solar and wind power 
because of the natural decline in production from existing wells in our areas of operation  our success depends on our ability to obtain new sources of supply of petroleum products  which is dependent on factors beyond our control 
any decrease in the volumes of these products that we gather could adversely affect our business and operating results 
the volumes that support our business are dependent on the level of production from wells connected to our gathering systems  the production from which may be less than we expect as a result of a natural decline of producing wells over time and the shut in of wells for economic or other reasons 
as a result  our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time 
in order to maintain or increase throughput levels on our gathering systems  we must obtain new sources of petroleum products 
the primary factors affecting our ability to obtain sources of these products include the level of successful drilling activity near our systems and our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells 
we have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation  the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our gathering systems or the rate at which production from a well declines 
in addition  we have no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions  which are affected by  among other things  the availability and cost of capital  prevailing and projected energy prices  demand for petroleum products  levels of reserves  geological considerations  environmental or other governmental regulations  the availability of drilling permits  the availability of drilling rigs  and other drilling  production and development costs 
fluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new petroleum product reserves and  to a lesser extent  production from existing wells 
in general terms  energy prices fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
declines in energy prices could have a negative impact on exploration  development and production activity and  if sustained  could lead to a material decrease in such activity 
sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation would lead to reduced utilization of our gathering and treating assets 
because of these factors  even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets  producers may choose not to develop those reserves 
if reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain levels of throughput on our systems  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our construction of new assets may not result in the anticipated revenue increases 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new assets 
if we undertake such projects  they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost  or at all 
moreover  our revenue may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for instance  if we expand a pipeline  the construction may occur over an extended period of time and we will not receive any material increases in revenue until the project is completed 
moreover  we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize 
since we are not engaged in the exploration for  and the development of  natural gas and crude oil reserves  we do not possess reserve expertise and we often do not have access to third party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area 
to the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our system  such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of numerous uncertainties 
table of contents inherent in estimating quantities of future production 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return which could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
we may not be able to renew or replace expiring storage contracts 
we have significant exposure to market risk at the time our existing storage contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal 
the extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the level of existing and new competition to provide storage services to our markets  macroeconomic factors affecting crude oil storage economics for our current and potential customers  balance of supply and demand  on a short term  seasonal and long term basis  in our markets  extent to which the customers in our markets are willing to contract on a long term basis  and effects of federal  state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers 
any failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts  or extend or replace them at comparable rates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and rose rock s ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders  including us 
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies could result in increased regulation of our assets  which could affect existing costs and rates 
interstate transportation and gathering pipelines that do not provide interstate services are not subject to regulation by ferc 
however  the distinction between ferc regulated interstate pipeline transportation on the one hand  and intrastate pipeline transportation  on the other hand  is a fact based determination 
the classification and regulation of our crude oil pipelines are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  federal courts  congress or regulatory commissions  courts or legislatures in the states in which we operate 
our kansas and oklahoma gathering pipeline system carries crude oil owned by us and by third parties 
we own all of the crude oil shipped on our pipeline system across state lines 
we believe that the pipeline segments on which we provide service to third parties and the services we provide to third parties on the gathering pipeline system meet the traditional tests that ferc has used to determine that the pipeline services provided are not interstate commerce 
we believe that the pipeline segments on which we transport only crude oil owned by us should not be subject to regulation by ferc under the ica  or that these pipeline segments would qualify for waiver from ferc s regulatory requirements  if applicable 
however  we cannot provide assurance that ferc will not in the future  either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative  determine that some or all of our kansas and oklahoma gathering pipeline system and the services we provide on that system are within its jurisdiction  or that such a determination would not adversely affect our results of operations 
if some or all of the gathering system were subject to ferc jurisdiction  and not otherwise exempt from any applicable regulatory requirements  for that portion of the gathering pipeline system we would be required to file a tariff with ferc  and if our tariff rates were subject to protest  provide a cost justification for the transportation rate subject to protest and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination 
in addition  if the services we provide on any segment s of our gathering system become regulated by ferc under the ica  our services could be subject to a protest and or complaint before ferc 
if ferc were to determine  in response to a complaint  that our rates are unjust and unreasonable  we could be required to pay reparations and refunds dating to two years before the filing of the complaint 
furthermore  if in the future our services become subject to state regulation  they could be subject to a protest and or complaint before a state commission with jurisdiction 

table of contents increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in crude oil production in our areas of operation  which could adversely impact our business and results of operations 
an increasing percentage of crude oil production is being developed from unconventional sources such as shale 
these reservoirs require hydraulic fracturing completion processes to release the crude oil from the rock so it can flow through casing to the surface 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into the formation to stimulate crude oil production 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  including on water quality and public health  with results of the study anticipated to be available by late at the same time  certain environmental groups have suggested that additional laws may be needed to more closely and uniformly regulate the hydraulic fracturing process  and legislation has been proposed by some members of congress to provide for such regulation 
for instance  the us congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to subject hydraulic fracturing operations to regulation under that act 
sponsors of bills currently pending before the us senate and house of representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
proposed legislation would require  among other things  the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings against producers and service providers 
in addition  these bills  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting of hydraulic fracturing operations at the federal level  which could lead to operational delays  increased operating and compliance costs and additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult or commercially impracticable to perform hydraulic fracturing  delaying the development of unconventional resources from shale formations which are not commercial without the use of hydraulic fracturing 
the department of energy  at the direction of the president  is also studying hydraulic fracturing in order to provide recommendations and identify best practices and other steps to enhance companies safety and environmental performance in their hydraulic fracturing operations 
in addition  several states have already passed  or are considering  legislation that is intended to regulate hydraulic fracturing 
we cannot predict what effect such legislation will have on the production of crude oil in our areas of operation 
the imposition of additional regulations and permit requirements could lead to delays or increased operating costs for crude oil producers 
a reduction in the production of crude oil in our areas of operation could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of business we provide gathering  transportation  storage  distribution  marketing and other midstream services primarily to independent producers  refiners of petroleum products and other market participants located in the midwest and rocky mountain regions of the us  canada and the west coast of the uk we  or our significant equity method investees  have an asset base consisting of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities  terminals  processing plants and other distribution assets located between north american production and supply areas  including the gulf coast  rocky mountain and western canadian regions and areas of high demand such as the midwest region of the us we maintain and operate storage  terminal and marine facilities at milford haven in the uk that enable customers to supply products to markets in the atlantic basin 
we also operate a network of liquid asphalt cement terminals throughout mexico 
our strategically located pipelines  terminals and storage tanks  with access to north american transportation pipeline interconnects  are well positioned to benefit from the continuing need to transport and gather petroleum products from areas of supply to areas of demand 
how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance 
we view these metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and review these measurements on at least a monthly basis for consistency and trend analysis 
these metrics include financial measures such as adjusted gross margin  operating expenses and adjusted ebitda 
adjusted gross margin we view adjusted gross margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations  as well as our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing methods  historical cost basis  capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices 
we define adjusted gross margin as total revenues minus cost of products sold and unrealized gain loss on derivatives 
adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the operating results between our fee based activities  which do not involve the purchase or sale of petroleum products  and our fixed margin and marketing operations  which do 
in addition  adjusted gross margin allows us to make a meaningful comparison of the results of our fixed margin and marketing operations across different commodity price environments because it measures the spread between the product sales price and costs of products sold 
operating expenses our management seeks to maximize the profitability of our operations  in part  by minimizing operating expenses 
these expenses are comprised of salary and wage expense  utility costs  insurance premiums  taxes and other operating costs  some of which are independent of the volumes we handle 
the current high levels of crude oil exploration  development and production activities are increasing competition for personnel and equipment 
this increased competition is placing upward pressure on the prices we pay for labor  supplies and miscellaneous equipment 
to the extent we are unable to procure necessary services or offset higher costs  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization and adjusted for selected items that semgroup believes impact the comparability 
table of contents of financial results between reporting periods 
we use adjusted ebitda as a supplemental performance measure to assess our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing methods  historical cost basis  capital structure or the impact of fluctuating commodity prices  and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities 
note about non gaap financial measures adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda are not financial measures presented in accordance with gaap 
we believe that the presentation of these non gaap financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations 
operating income loss is the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted gross margin  and net income loss is the gaap measure most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda 
our non gaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
each of these non gaap financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes some  but not all  items that affect the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
you should not consider adjusted gross margin or adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda may be defined differently by other companies in our industry  our definitions of these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing their utility 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the difference between adjusted gross margin and adjusted ebitda  on the one hand  and operating income loss and net income loss  on the other hand  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results

table of contents business and performance drivers we operate our business through six primary business segments crude  semstream  semlogistics  semcams  semmexico and semgas 
we generate revenue in these segments by utilizing our assets to provide products and services to third parties and by selectively using our assets to support our marketing activities 
for certain products  the relationship between current and future price is generally seasonal 
we believe that the variety of our petroleum product assets creates opportunities for us and our customers year round 
certain factors are key to our operations 
these include the safe  reliable and efficient operation of the pipelines and facilities that we own and operate while meeting the regulations that govern the operation of our assets and the costs associated with such regulations 
our revenue is impacted by several factors  including throughput and processing fees throughput and processing fees are fees charged to third parties based on volumes of product run through our processing facilities or pipeline gathering systems 
service  storage and terminalling fees storage and terminalling fees are fees charged to third parties for petroleum product storage or terminalling services provided by us and are based on leased shell capacity and or volumes moved through our terminal facilities 
tariffs tariffs are fees charged to third parties for the transportation of their petroleum products on our regulated white cliffs pipeline 
petroleum product marketing we intend to capture the normalized gross margin associated with the purchase and sale of petroleum products 
purchases  sales and derivative transactions related to this activity are tracked in our systems to the ultimate realization of profit 
we seek to maintain limited net open positions to manage our exposure to commodity prices 
marketing transactions may only be entered into by persons delegated such authority by senior management  as provided in our comprehensive risk management policy 
each person authorized to make transactions is subject to internal volume and dollar limits  portfolios are subject to net open position and stop loss limits  and counterparties are subject to credit limits and provisions as approved by our credit department 
see business risk governance and comprehensive risk management policy for more information on our comprehensive risk management policy 
revenue our revenue is generated from third party fees earned through the gathering  pipeline transporting and storing of petroleum products principally in the midwest region 
our customers pay us fees based on volumes gathered  transported and stored  through the sale of petroleum products based upon contract or index rates per barrel  million btu or gallon 
we generate additional revenue through selected marketing of petroleum products 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating petroleum products purchased at the lease along pipeline systems or trucked  and arranging the necessary transportation logistics for the ultimate sale or delivery of the petroleum products to customers or other end users 
gathering and transportation revenue is recognized as petroleum products are delivered to customers 
storage revenue is recognized upon leasing of shell capacity on a take or pay basis 
marketing revenue is accrued at the time title to the petroleum product sold transfers to the purchaser  which typically occurs upon receipt of the petroleum product by the purchaser 
we utilize futures  swaps and options contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices  to protect our gross margins on our purchased petroleum products and to manage our liquidity risk 
table of contents associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions 
when purchasing petroleum products  we seek to manage our exposure to commodity price risk 
as we purchase inventory from suppliers  we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales utilizing one of the following methods we have already sold that product for physical delivery pursuant to sales contracts at a market index price  we sell the product for future physical delivery pursuant to effectively back to back sales contracts  or we enter into futures and swaps contracts on the nymex or over the counter otc markets 
in addition  we may purchase put options or derivatives other than futures or swaps to hedge our inventory of petroleum products prior to our sale of such inventory 
asc  nonmonetary transactions  requires certain transactions those where inventory is purchased from a customer then resold to the same customers to be presented in the income statement on a net basis  resulting in a reduction of revenue and costs of products sold by the same amount  but has no effect on operating income loss 
however  changes in the level of such purchase and sale activity between periods can have an effect on the comparison between those periods 
volumes generally  we expect revenue to increase or decrease in conjunction with increases or decreases in total volumes 
our total volumes are affected by different factors including our physical storage or transportation capacity  our working capital and credit availability under our credit facilities to support petroleum product purchases and the availability of the supply of petroleum product available for purchase  which is determined based primarily upon producer activity in market areas contiguous with our asset base 
commodity prices our business is primarily fee based 
as a result  our financial results are typically not correlated with increases and decreases in commodity prices 
our financial results  however  are positively correlated with the absolute difference between current prompt and future month petroleum product prices 
that is  wide contango when the prices for future deliveries are higher than current prices spreads generally have a favorable impact on our results relative to a slightly contango  flat market  or backwardated when the prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices 
timing of purchase and sales our financial results are affected by the timing of the purchase and sale of petroleum products  such that financial results may not be comparable between periods 
when we enter into an arrangement to purchase product  place the product in storage and resell the product in the future  our financial results do not reflect any related margin until the settlement of the product sale 
prior to the settlement of the product sale  our results reflect the cost of the product in our inventory 
differences in the timing of our product purchases and sales  especially if they extend over fiscal years or quarters  may result in sizeable differences between our results over the comparable period 
analysis of business segments the following provides an overview of the makeup of revenue at each of our respective business segments 
crude rose rock was formed in august in november  semgroup contributed semcrude  lp to rose rock in exchange for limited partner interests  general partner interests and certain incentive distribution rights 

table of contents in december  rose rock completed an initial public offering in which it sold  common units representing limited partner interests 
semgroup consolidates the accounts of rose rock as a result of the level of its ownership interests and control over the entity 
crude conducts business through its ownership interest in white cliffs pipeline which it operates and a general partner interest and limited partner interest in rose rock 
these operations include crude oil transportation  storage  terminalling  gathering and marketing in colorado  kansas  montana  north dakota  oklahoma and texas  for third party customers as well as for itself 
the crude business unit consists of three primary operations i kansas and oklahoma pipeline system rose rock  ii cushing storage rose rock  and iii white cliffs pipeline 
a majority of crude s revenue is generated from fee based contractual arrangements that  in some instances  are fixed and not dependent on usage 
fee based services crude charges a capacity or volume based fee for the unloading  transportation and storage of crude oil and related ancillary services 
crude s fee based services include substantially all of its operations in cushing and platteville and a portion of the transportation services it provides on its kansas and oklahoma pipeline system 
some of crude s fee based contracts are take or pay contracts whereby the customer is required to pay crude a fixed minimum monthly fee regardless of usage 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of crude s adjusted gross margin  respectively  was generated by providing fee based services to customers 
fixed margin transactions crude purchases crude oil from a producer or supplier at a designated receipt point at an index price less a transportation fee  and simultaneously sells an identical volume of crude oil at a designated delivery point to the same party at the same index price  thereby locking in a fixed margin that is in effect economically equivalent to a transportation fee 
we refer to these arrangements as fixed margin or buy sell transactions 
these fixed margin transactions account for a portion of the adjusted gross margin crude generates on its kansas and oklahoma pipeline system and through its bakken shale operations 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of its adjusted gross margin  respectively  was generated through fixed margin transactions 
marketing activities crude conducts marketing activities by purchasing crude oil for its own account from producers  aggregators and traders and selling crude oil to traders and refiners 
crude s marketing activities account for a portion of the adjusted gross margin it generates on its kansas and oklahoma pipeline system and through its bakken shale operations 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of its adjusted gross margin  respectively  was generated through marketing activities 
we mitigate the commodity price exposure of our crude oil marketing operations by limiting our net open positions through i the concurrent purchase and sale of like quantities of crude oil to create back to back transactions intended to lock in positive margins based on the timing  location or quality of the crude oil purchased and delivered or ii derivative contracts 
all of our marketing activities are subject to our comprehensive risk management policy  which establishes limits to manage risk and mitigate financial exposure 
more specifically  we utilize futures and swap contracts to manage our exposure to market changes in commodity prices  to protect our adjusted gross margin on our purchased crude oil and to manage our liquidity risk associated with margin deposit requirements on our overall derivative positions 
as we purchase inventory from suppliers  we may establish a fixed or variable margin with future sales by selling a like quantity of crude oil for future physical delivery to create an effective back to back transaction  or 
table of contents entering into futures and swaps contracts on the nymex or over the counter markets 
semstream on november   semstream contributed the primary operating assets of this business segment to ngl energy in exchange for cash and equity interests 
as part of this transaction  we agreed to waive our distribution rights on certain units until the third quarter of in exchange  we received additional common units 
we own of the common units outstanding at december   of ngl energy s general partner and exercise significant influence through two general partner board seats 
as a result  we account for our ownership as an investment using the equity method 
going forward  we will include our share of ngl energy earnings on a one quarter lag because we will not receive their financial statements in sufficient time to apply the equity method currently 
semstream holds semgroup s ownership interest in ngl energy  a company engaged in coast to coast retail propane operations as well as midstream terminal operations 
semstream also  through its wholly owned subsidiary  semstream arizona propane  llc semstream arizona  is engaged in retail sales and downstream distribution of propane in page and payson  arizona  including a regulated underground utility business and a non regulated propane bulk business 
semlogistics semlogistics owns the largest independent petroleum products storage facility in the uk the facility is located on the north bank of the milford haven waterway on the west coast of wales 
the main activities of semlogistics are the receipt  storage and redelivery of clean petroleum and crude oil products via sea going vessels at the milford haven site 
semlogistic s revenue is based on fixed fee storage tank leases and related services 
semcams semcams operates majority owned gathering assets and natural gas processing plants 
we acquired the canadian natural gas processing and gathering operations of central alberta midstream  or cams  in march all of semcams assets are located in west central alberta  in the heart of the western canadian sedimentary basin  which accounts for approximately of canada s sour natural gas production 
semcams revenue is based on fee based throughput arrangements and profit sharing from plant operations 
semmexico semmexico operates a network of liquid asphalt terminals in mexico 
operations include purchasing  producing  storing and distributing liquid asphalt cement products 
semmexico purchases asphalt from local refineries in mexico 
semmexico s revenue is based on margin from contractual arrangements with customers and suppliers for liquid asphalt cement 
in general  semmexico s sales and purchases of liquid asphalt cement are matched and semmexico carries limited exposure to price movements 
semgas semgas provides gathering  processing and storage services to the natural gas markets in the us semgas owns and operates gathering systems and processing plants in kansas  oklahoma and texas 
semgas aggregates gas supplies from the wellhead and provides various services to producers that condition the wellhead gas production for downstream markets 
semgas performance is largely based on percent of proceeds and percent of index contractual arrangements where semgas receives a portion of product sales as well as fee based gathering service payments 
we previously had another business segment  semcanada crude  which aggregated and blended crude oil in western canada  north dakota and montana 
during  we transferred certain of semcanada crude s activities to crude and we began winding down the remaining operations of semcanada crude 

table of contents results of operations overview on july   semgroup  lp and certain of its lp subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code the petition date 
also on july   semgroup  lp s canadian subsidiaries filed applications for creditor protection under the companies creditors arrangement act 
later during  certain other us subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization 
while under bankruptcy protection  semgroup  lp sold or liquidated certain of its subsidiaries 
all remaining subsidiaries emerged from the bankruptcy on november  the emergence date 
we emerged as a newly reorganized company named semgroup corporation 
we lost control of several of our subsidiaries as a direct  or indirect  result of the bankruptcy petitions  including all canadian subsidiaries  semgroup holdings  lp which directly held our limited partnership interests in blueknight energy partners  lp  formerly semgroup energy partners  lp  and indirectly held our general partnership interests in blueknight  and wyckoff gas storage company  llc wyckoff 
these subsidiaries were de consolidated during and subsequently accounted for as cost method investments  and not included in results of operations subsequent to deconsolidation 
we regained control of semcams and semcanada crude on the emergence date  and consolidated these subsidiaries again beginning on that date 
we ceased operations of semcanada energy near the time of the bankruptcy filing in july as part of the process of reorganizing to emerge from bankruptcy protection  we determined the need to dispose of certain operations 
semfuel  semmaterials and semeuro supply met the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations 
we applied fresh start reporting on november  we recorded individual assets and liabilities based on their fair values at november   using the assistance of a valuation advisor to determine the values of certain assets 
we adjusted deferred tax liabilities  where appropriate  to reflect the change in the financial reporting basis of assets 
as a result of these factors the bankruptcy  deconsolidation and reconsolidation of certain subsidiaries  sale of subsidiary assets and fresh start reporting and other factors  comparison of the results of operations between and shown below is not useful as a guide to future results of operations 
the financial performance for the first months of are presented for historical perspective and do not give pro forma results as if the consummation of the plan of reorganization and the related fresh start reporting and other adjustments had occurred at the beginning of the period presented 
additionally  our post emergence financial statements are not comparable with our pre emergence financial statements 
recent developments on february   semgroup  gavilon midstream energy  llc  a subsidiary of the gavilon group  llc  and an affiliate of chesapeake energy corporation nyse chk announced plans to form a joint venture that will construct a mile pipeline in western and north central oklahoma which will deliver crude oil to a million barrel storage facility in cushing  oklahoma 
the pipeline and storage facility will meet growing midstream requirements resulting from the burgeoning drilling activity in western oklahoma and the mississippi lime play 
the pipeline will consist of two laterals  one originating near the town of alva in woods county  oklahoma  and the other near the town of arnett in ellis county  oklahoma 
the laterals will intersect near cleo springs in major county  oklahoma  where the pipeline will increase in diameter and continue east to storage at cushing 
the pipeline will have an initial capacity of  barrels per day  and following the addition of more horsepower  a maximum operating capacity of  barrels per day 
construction of the pipeline is planned to begin in july  and it is expected to be in service in the third quarter of

general and administrative expenses for the eleven months ended november   corporate general and administrative expenses were allocated to the segments based on percentages established by semgroup management 
at the beginning of each year  management estimated corporate general and administrative costs and assigned the segments a flat monthly charge of that amount 
from time to time  the monthly charges were reviewed and adjusted 
in addition to the flat monthly charge  the segments would also be allocated a portion of the over or under allocation of actual corporate general and administrative expense from the prior month 
this monthly true up was based on each segment s year to date allocation as a percentage of the total year to date corporate general and administrative expense 
beginning in december  the general and administrative expenses of each corporate department has been allocated to the segments based on criteria such as actual usage  headcount and estimates of effort or benefit 
the method for allocating cost is based on the type of service being provided 
for example  internal audit costs are based on an estimate of effort attributable to a segment 
in contrast  accounting department costs are allocated based on the number of transactions processed for a given segment compared to the total number processed

december versus average of eleven months ended november  general the company desires to provide a meaningful comparison of the results of operations of the successor december to that of the predecessor eleven months ended november  
in order to make this comparison as useful as possible  we have based the comparison on the average of the eleven months ended november  in this way  any significant changes from the average can be identified and become the subject of explanation 
revenue revenue in december is approximately percent less than the average of the eleven months ended november   primarily because certain marketing activity that occurred in the first ten months of did not occur in december 
the marketing activity stopped in october because of the company s assessment of the spread between current prices and forward prices for crude oil 
costs of products sold costs of products sold in december is approximately percent less than the average of the eleven months ended november   because certain marketing activity that occurred in the first ten months of did not occur in december 
this percentage decline is higher than what is shown in the revenue explanation above because the marketing activity has a significant costs of products sold component in contrast to transportation or storage revenue  which do not

semlogistics successor predecessor us in thousands year ended december  year ended december  one month ended december  eleven months ended november  revenues expenses costs of products sold operating general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss gain on disposal or impairment total expenses operating income loss versus revenue revenue decreased in to million from million in the decline in revenue is a result of a decline in the volume of storage leased 
high crude oil prices and backwardated market conditions ie  prices for future deliveries are lower than current prices and are forecast to continue into these factors have a negative effect on storage economics 
as a result  the demand for storage is depressed and we have experienced difficulty securing contract renewals 
we are uncertain when market conditions will improve 
operating expense operating expense decreased in to million from million in this decline is due primarily to a reduction in employee related expenses such as the elimination of the short term incentive program

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the application of these policies involves judgments regarding future events  including the likelihood of success of particular projects and legal and regulatory challenges 
these judgments  in and of themselves  could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions  which may be appropriate to use 
in addition  the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect  not only on the operation of the business  but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures  even if the nature of the accounting policies have not changed

our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this form k 
we identify our critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents accounting policy judgment uncertainty affecting application fresh start reporting and reorganization value determination of reorganization value allocation of the reorganization value to our assets based on their fair values derivative instruments instruments used in valuation techniques market maturity and economic conditions contract interpretation market conditions in the energy industry  especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commitments income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets ability to withstand legal challenges of tax authority decisions or appeals anticipated future decisions of tax authorities application of tax statutes and regulations to transactions ability to use tax benefits carry forwards to future periods impairment of long lived assets recoverability of investment through future operations regulatory and political environments and requirements estimated useful lives of assets environmental obligations and operational limitations estimates of future cash flows estimates of fair value judgment about triggering effects goodwill and other intangible assets estimated useful lives for finite lived intangible assets judgment about impairment triggering events identification of reporting units estimates of reporting unit s fair value contingencies estimated financial impact of event judgment about the likelihood of event occurring regulatory and political environments and requirements fresh start reporting and reorganization value as part of our emergence from the bankruptcy on november   we implemented fresh start reporting in accordance with asc  reorganizations 
accordingly  our assets  liabilities and equity were adjusted to fair value 
our consolidated financial statements for periods subsequent to november   reflect a new basis of accounting and are not comparable to our historical consolidated financial statements for periods prior to november  under fresh start reporting  a reorganization value is determined and allocated to our net assets based on their relative fair values in a manner similar to the accounting provisions applied to business combinations under asc  business combinations 
adjustments necessary to state our balance sheet accounts at fair value were made based on the work of management  financial consultants and independent appraisals 
the estimates and assumptions used to derive the reorganization value and the allocation of that value to assets is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
modification to these assumptions could have significantly changed the reorganization value and the resultant fair values of our assets 
derivative instruments we follow the guidance of asc  derivatives and hedging  to account for derivative instruments 
asc requires us to mark to market all derivative instruments on the balance sheet  and recognize changes in the fair value of non hedge derivative instruments immediately in earnings 
in certain cases  we may apply hedge accounting to our derivative instruments 
the criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is 
table of contents appropriate are i the designation of the hedge to an underlying exposure  ii whether the overall risk is being reduced  and iii if there is a correlation between the fair value of the derivative instrument and the underlying hedged item 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments accounted for as hedges are either recognized in earnings as an offset to the changes in the fair value of the related hedged item  or deferred and recorded as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur 
certain derivative instruments that meet the criteria for derivative accounting treatment also qualify for a scope exception to derivative accounting  as they are considered to be a normal purchase normal sale npns 
the availability of this exception is based on the assumption that the company has the ability  and it is probable  to deliver or take delivery of the underlying item 
these assumptions are based on internal forecasts of sales and historical physical delivery on contracts 
derivatives that are considered to be npns are exempt from derivative accounting treatment and are accounted for under accrual accounting 
if it is determined that a transaction designated as npns no longer meets the scope exception due to changes in estimates  the related contract would be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value combined with immediate recognition through earnings 
income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million on our deferred tax assets 
foreign tax credits of million are the primary deferred tax asset 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million on our deferred tax assets 
foreign tax credits of million are the primary deferred tax asset 
in assessing the recognition of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character within the carryback and carryforward period available under the tax law 
sources of taxable income include future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future earnings and available tax planning strategies 
considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of a particular item that involves interpretations of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions including canada  mexico and the united kingdom 
evaluation of assets for impairment for other than temporary decline in value in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  we evaluate property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
examples of such indicators are significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  significant adverse change in the manner an asset is used or its physical condition  adverse business climate  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  and change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold such asset through the end of its estimated useful life to a greater than fifty percent likelihood that such asset will be disposed of before then 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
however  actual future market prices and costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates and the impact of such variations could be material 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets we apply asc  business combinations  and asc  intangibles goodwill and other  to account for goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with these standards  we amortize all finite lived intangible assets over their respective estimated weighted average useful lives  while goodwill has an indefinite life and is not amortized 
however  goodwill and all intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we test for impairment at the reporting unit level using three valuation approaches first  the income approach which measures the value of an asset by the present value of its future economic benefit  second  the market approach which measures the value of an asset through the analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable properties  and third  the cost approach which measures the value of an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility 
estimation of future economic benefit requires management to make assumptions about numerous variables including selling prices  costs  the level of activity and appropriate discount rates 
if it is determined that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount  our goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives will be impaired at that time 
contingencies we record a loss contingency when management determines that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
such determinations are subject to interpretations of current facts and circumstances  forecasts of future events and estimates of the financial impacts of such events 
gain contingencies are not recorded 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this discussion on market risks represents an estimate of possible changes in future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur  and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in interest rates or commodity prices and the timing of transactions 
we are exposed to various market risks  including volatility in i petroleum prices  ii interest rates and iii currency exchange rates 
we may utilize from time to time various derivative instruments to manage such exposure 
our risk management policies and procedures are designed to monitor physical and financial commodity positions and the resulting outright commodity price risk as well as basis risk resulting from differences in commodity grades  purchase and sales locations and purchase and sale timing 
we have a risk management function that has responsibility and authority for our comprehensive risk management policy  which governs our enterprise wide risks  including the market risks discussed in this item 
subject to our comprehensive risk management policy  our finance and treasury function has responsibility and authority for managing exposure to interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the risks discussed above  we engage in price risk management activities 
the following discussion addresses each category of risk 
see business risk governance and comprehensive risk management policy for more information on our comprehensive risk management policy 
commodity price risk commodity prices have historically been volatile and cyclical 
for example  nymex wti benchmark prices have ranged from an all time high of over per barrel june july to a low of approximately per barrel march over the last years 

table of contents the table below outlines the range of nymex prompt month daily settle prices for crude oil and natural gas futures  and the range of daily propane spot prices provided by an independent  third party broker for the years ended december   and light sweet crude oil futures per barrel mont belvieu non ldh spot propane per gallon henry hub natural gas futures per mmbtu year ended december  high low high low differential year ended december  high low high low differential year ended december  high low high low differential revenue from our asset based activities is dependent on throughput volume  tariff rates  the level of fees generated from our pipeline systems  capacity leased to third parties  capacity that we use for our own operational or marketing activities and the level of other fees generated at our terminalling and storage facilities 
profit from our marketing activities is dependent on our ability to sell petroleum products at prices in excess of our aggregate cost 
margins may be affected during transitional periods between a backwardated market when the prices for future deliveries are lower than the current prices and a contango market when the prices for future deliveries are higher than the current prices 
our petroleum product marketing activities within each of our segments are generally not directly affected by the absolute level of petroleum product prices  but are affected by overall levels of supply and demand for petroleum products and relative fluctuations in marked related indices 
based on our open derivative contracts at december   a increase in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in a less than million decrease in our crude oil sales revenues 
a decrease in the applicable market price or prices for each derivative contract would result in a less than million increase in our crude oil sales revenues 
however  the increases or decreases in crude oil sales revenues we recognize from our open derivative contracts are substantially offset by higher or lower crude oil sales revenues when the physical sale of the product occurs 
these contracts may be for the purchase or sale of crude oil or in markets different from the physical markets in which we are attempting to hedge our exposure  or may have timing differences relative to the physical markets 
as a result of these factors  our hedges may not eliminate all price risks 
margin deposits or other credit support  including letters of credit  are generally required on derivative instruments utilized to manage our price exposure 
as commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair value of our derivative instruments changes  thereby increasing or decreasing our margin deposit or other credit support requirements 
although a component of our risk management strategy is intended to manage the margin and other credit support requirements on our derivative instruments  volatile spot and forward commodity prices  or an expectation of increased commodity price volatility  could increase the cash needed to manage our commodity price exposure and thereby increase our liquidity requirements 
this may limit amounts available to us through borrowing  decrease the volume of petroleum products we purchase and sell or limit our commodity price management activities 

table of contents interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit facilities 
therefore  from time to time we may utilize interest rate derivatives to manage interest obligations on specific debt issuances 
our variable rate debt bears interest at libor or prime  subject to certain floors  plus the applicable margin 
at december   an increase in these base rates of  above the base rate floors  would increase our interest expense by million per year 
the average interest rates presented below are based upon rates in effect at december  and december  the carrying value of the variable rate instruments in our credit facilities approximate fair value primarily because our rates fluctuate with prevailing market rates 
the following table summarizes our debt obligations liabilities december  december  short term debt variable rate million million average interest rate long term debt variable rate million million average interest rate long term debt fixed rate million million fixed interest rate currency exchange risk the cash flows relating to our uk  canada and mexico operations are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in british pounds  canadian dollars and mexican pesos 
assets and liabilities of our uk  canadian and mexican subsidiaries are translated to uk dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenue  expenses and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period
