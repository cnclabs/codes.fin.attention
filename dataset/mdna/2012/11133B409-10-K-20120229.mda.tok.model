item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we are the leading global provider of software that enables fixed line  mobile and cable service providers to deliver voice and multimedia services over their ip based networks 
our software  broadworks  enables our service provider customers to provide enterprises and consumers with a range of cloud based  or hosted  ip multimedia communications  such as pbxs  video calling  uc  collaboration and converged mobile and fixed line services 
we began selling broadworks in over service providers in more than countries have purchased and or are delivering services utilizing our software  including of the top telecommunications service providers globally  as measured by revenue for the year ended december  we sell our products to service providers both directly and indirectly through distribution partners  such as telecommunications equipment vendors vars and other distributors 
key financial highlights some of our key financial highlights for the year ended december  include total revenue increased by  or million  to million  compared to million for  gross profit increased to million  compared to million for gross margin increased to  compared to for  operating income increased to million  or of total revenue  compared to million  or of total revenue  for  net income increased to million  compared to million for deferred revenue decreased million to million  compared to an increase of million for  and cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for components of operating results revenue we derive our revenue from the sale of licenses  maintenance and services 
we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met in accordance with revenue recognition guidance 
this guidance provides that revenue should be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
our total revenue consists of the following licenses 
we derive license revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses 
we price our software based on the types of features and applications provided and on the number of subscriber licenses sold 
these factors impact the average selling price of our licenses and the comparability of average selling prices 
our license revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or from year to year as a result of long sales and deployment cycles  variations in customer ordering practices and the application of management s judgment in applying complex revenue recognition rules 
our deferred license revenue balance consists of software orders that do not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition 
we are unable to predict the proportion of orders that will meet all the criteria for revenue recognition relative to those orders that will not meet all such criteria and  as a result  we cannot forecast whether any historical trends in 
table of contents recognized license revenue and deferred license revenue will continue 
as of december   our deferred license revenue balance was million  substantially all of which we expect to become earned revenue within the next months 
maintenance and services 
we generally sell annual maintenance contracts with our software licenses 
these contracts provide for software updates  upgrades and technical support 
our typical warranty on licensed software is days and  during this period  our customers are entitled to receive maintenance and support without the purchase of a maintenance contract 
after the expiration of the warranty period  our customers must purchase an annual maintenance contract to continue receiving ongoing software maintenance and customer support 
we also sell professional services  which consist of implementation  training and consulting services 
as of december   our deferred maintenance and services revenue balance was million  the current portion of which was million 
cost of revenue our total cost of revenue consists of the following cost of license revenue 
a substantial majority of the cost of license revenue consists of royalties paid to third parties whose technology or products are sold as part of broadworks and  to a lesser extent  amortization of acquired technology 
most of these royalty payments are for the underlying embedded data base technology within broadworks for which we currently pay a fixed fee per quarter  which will increase beginning in june as a result of our recently executed third party license agreement 
such costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
cost of maintenance and services revenue 
cost of maintenance and services revenue consists primarily of personnel related expenses and other direct costs associated with the support  maintenance and implementation of our software licenses  as well as training and consulting services 
personnel expenses include salaries  commissions  benefits  bonuses  reimbursement of expenses and stock based compensation 
such costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred 
gross profit gross profit is the calculation of total revenue minus cost of revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including mix of license  maintenance and services revenue 
we generate higher gross margins on license revenue compared to maintenance and services revenue 
growth or decline of license revenue 
a substantial portion of cost of license revenue is fixed and is expensed in the period in which it occurs 
this cost consists primarily of the royalty payments to our embedded database provider 
if license revenue increases  these fixed payments will decline as a percentage of revenue 
if license revenue declines  these fixed payments will increase as a percentage of revenue 
impact of deferred revenue 
if we are unable to determine vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for any undelivered element within an arrangement  or any other revenue recognition criteria have not been met  the applicable revenue derived from the arrangement is deferred  including license  maintenance and services revenue  until all elements for which we could not determine vsoe have been delivered or other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
however  the cost of revenue  including the costs of license  maintenance and services  is typically expensed in the period in which it is incurred 
therefore  if relatively more revenue is deferred in a particular period  gross margin would decline in that period 
because the ability to recognize revenue on sales depends largely on the terms of the sale arrangement  and because we are not able to predict the proportion of orders that will not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition  we cannot forecast whether any historical trends in gross margin will continue 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
salaries and personnel costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew to employees at december  from employees at december   and we expect to continue to hire new employees to support our anticipated growth 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for our sales and marketing employees  including stock based compensation  commissions and bonuses 
additional expenses include marketing programs  consulting  travel and other related overhead 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in the foreseeable future as we further increase the number of our sales and marketing professionals and expand our marketing activities 
over the long term  we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as sales grow 
in  however  we do not expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel costs for development employees  including stock based compensation and bonuses 
additional expenses include costs related to development  quality assurance and testing of new software and enhancement of existing software  consulting  travel and other related overhead 
we engage third party international and domestic consulting firms for various research and development efforts  such as software development  documentation  quality assurance and software support 
we intend to continue to invest in our research and development efforts  including by hiring additional development personnel and by using outside consulting firms for various research and development efforts 
we believe continuing to invest in research and development efforts is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the foreseeable future  but over the long term to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as sales grow 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and personnel costs for administration  finance and accounting  legal  information systems and human resources employees  including stock based compensation and bonuses 
additional expenses include consulting and professional fees  travel  insurance and other corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the foreseeable future  but over the long term to decrease as a percentage of total revenue as sales grow 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation as part of cost of revenue and operating expenses in connection with the grant or modification of stock options and other equity awards to our directors  employees and consultants 
we apply the fair value method in accordance with authoritative guidance for determining the cost of stock based compensation 
the total cost of the grant or modification is measured based on the estimated fair value of the award at the date of grant 
the fair value is then recognized as stock based compensation expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period  of the award 
for  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
of the stock based compensation expense recorded for  million related to the vesting of restricted stock units  or rsus  covering an aggregate of  shares that were subject to a performance based vesting condition and that vested in full upon the completion of the ipo 
based on stock options and other equity awards outstanding as of december   we expect to recognize future expense related to the non vested portions of such options and other equity awards in the amount of million over a weighted average period of approximately years 
other income expense  net other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense and change in the fair value of the preferred stock warrants 
interest income represents interest received on our cash and cash equivalents and 
table of contents restricted cash 
interest expense consists primarily of the interest related to the convertible notes  and our installment bank loan with bank of america leasing and capital  llc  or bank of america  and for the years and prior interest accrued on outstanding borrowings under the orix loan 
income tax expense income tax expense consists of us federal  state and foreign income taxes 
we are required to pay income taxes in certain states and foreign jurisdictions 
historically  we have not been required to pay us federal income taxes due to our accumulated net operating losses 
for the year ended december   we have net operating loss carryforwards to utilize in the us for the year ended december   we paid alternative minimum tax in the 
del del 
us due to the taxable income generated in the period 
due to the release of our tax valuation allowance in  tax expense will increase in future periods 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
in accordance with gaap  we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we follow specific guidance applicable to software companies to determine when revenue should be recognized 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of software licenses and from the sale of maintenance for those licenses and services 
we generally license our software in combination with maintenance and may also include services 
we evaluate revenue recognition on a contract by contract basis because the terms of each arrangement may vary 
the accounting related to license revenue in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretation of rules that are subject to change 
as a result  the evaluation of our contractual arrangements often requires judgments and estimates that affect the timing of revenue recognition 
specifically  we are required to make judgments concerning whether the fees are fixed or determinable  whether collection of our fees is probable  whether services are essential to the functionality of the related software  and whether we have vsoe of the fair value of our software and services 
for license  maintenance and services revenue  our judgment is required to assess the probability of collection  which is generally based on the evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectability is probable and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive payment 
in accordance with software revenue recognition guidance  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  acceptance is received  if applicable  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer are fixed or determinable and collectability is probable and vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements 
we generally do not license software on a stand alone basis 
therefore  allocation of fees 
table of contents to the software component of multiple element arrangements is determined using the residual method 
if we are unable to determine vsoe for any undelivered element included within an arrangement  we defer revenue recognition until all elements for which we could not determine vsoe have been delivered 
license revenue we sell software licenses to service providers through our direct sales force and indirectly through distribution partners 
for direct sales  we generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote  when combined with a master license agreement  to constitute evidence of an arrangement 
in the case of sales through distribution partners  we generally consider a purchase order or executed sales quote  when combined with a reseller or similar agreement with the distribution partner  and evidence of the distribution partner s customer  to constitute evidence of an arrangement 
for sales through distribution partners for which we are not able to ascertain proof of the distribution partner s customer  we defer revenue until we are able to do so 
we consider delivery to have occurred when the customer is given electronic access to the licensed software and a license key for the software has been delivered or made available 
instances in which all ordered software features are not delivered are considered to be partial deliveries 
since we cannot determine vsoe of an undelivered software feature in the case of a partial delivery  we defer revenue recognition on all elements of such order until delivery for all ordered software features is complete 
acceptance of our licensed software generally occurs upon delivery 
from time to time  we have agreed with certain customers to a specific set of acceptance criteria 
in such cases  we defer revenue until these acceptance criteria have been met 
our sales generally consist of multiple elements software licenses  maintenance and services 
we calculate the amount of revenue allocated to the software license by determining the fair value of the undelivered elements  which often are maintenance and services  and subtracting it from the total order amount 
we establish vsoe of the fair value of maintenance based on the renewal price as stated in the agreement and as charged in the first optional renewal period under the arrangement 
our vsoe for services is determined based on an analysis of our historical daily rates when these services are sold separately from the software license 
the warranty period for our licensed software is generally days 
during this period  the customer receives technical support and has the right to unspecified product upgrades on an if and when available basis 
for these periods  we defer a portion of the license fee and recognize it ratably over the warranty period 
our license revenue is subject to significant fluctuation as a result of the application of accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies regarding revenue recognition 
we do not believe revenue to be the only meaningful measure of our level of sales activity during the periods reported because of the impact of software license orders for these periods that were not yet recognized as revenue and therefore were recorded as deferred license revenue 
our deferred license revenue balance consists of software orders that do not meet all the criteria for revenue recognition 
we are unable to predict the proportion of orders that will meet all the criteria for revenue recognition relative to those orders that will not meet all such criteria 
as a result  we cannot forecast whether these historical trends in recognized license revenue  and corresponding increases in deferred license revenue  will continue 
maintenance and services revenue we typically sell software in combination with maintenance 
maintenance is generally renewable annually at the option of the customer 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established 
table of contents based upon a specific percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement with the customer 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the maintenance period  assuming all other criteria of revenue recognition have been met 
revenue from software as a service  or saas  arrangements  being offered as part of our new hosted offereings  is based on a committed number of transactions and is recognized ratably over the customer term  assuming all other criteria of revenue recognition have been met 
over usage fees and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred 
saas revenue has been immaterial to date  but we expect it to grow as we continue to invest in our services offerings 
revenue from services is recognized as services are performed 
services are not considered essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
software development costs software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are expensed as incurred as research and development expense 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility  if any  are capitalized until the software is available for general release to customers 
for each software release  judgment is required to evaluate when technological feasibility has occurred 
historically  we have determined that technological feasibility has been established at approximately the same time as our general release of such software to customers 
therefore  to date  we have not capitalized any software development costs 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are stated at realizable value  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts that is maintained for estimated losses that would result from the inability of some customers to make payments as they become due 
the allowance is based on an analysis of past due amounts and ongoing credit evaluations 
customers are generally evaluated for creditworthiness through a credit review process at the time of each order 
our collection experience has been consistent with our estimates 
business combinations in a business combination  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired business identifiable assets and liabilities at their acquisition date fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities  if any  is recorded as goodwill 
the excess  if any  of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the consideration transferred is recognized as a gain within other income in the consolidated statement of operations as of the acquisition date 
to date  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations have primarily consisted of acquired working capital and definite lived intangible assets 
the carrying value of acquired working capital is assumed to be equal to its fair value  given the short term nature of these assets and liabilities 
we estimate the fair value of definite lived intangible assets acquired using a discounted cash flow approach  which includes an analysis of the future cash flows expected to be generated by such assets and the risk associated with achieving such cash flows 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model include the discount rate that is applied to the discretely forecasted future cash flows to calculate the present value of those cash flows and the estimate of future cash flows attributable to the acquired intangible assets  which include revenue  operating expenses and taxes 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of a the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred in a business combination  over b the fair value of assets acquired  net of liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests as described below 
we test goodwill for impairment annually on december  or more frequently if events or changes in business circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in our business climate  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a significant portion of our business will be sold  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  the assigned goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the fair value is less than the reporting unit s carrying value  step two is required to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
in the second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of the reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if the reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment charge would be recorded to operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations in the period the determination is made 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit  broadsoft  inc  which is the consolidated entity 
based on the results of our annual goodwill impairment testing in  and  our fair value exceeded our book value by a substantial margin 
therefore  the second step of the impairment test was not required to be performed and no goodwill impairment was recognized 
however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not be impaired at any time in the future 
intangible assets we acquired intangible assets in connection with certain of our business acquisitions 
these assets were recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date and are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are used 
estimated useful lives are determined based on our historical use of similar assets and the expectation of future realization of revenue attributable to the intangible assets 
changes in circumstances  such as technological advances or changes to our business model  could result in the actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an intangible asset should be shortened  we amortize the net book value in excess of the estimated salvage value over its revised remaining useful life 
we did not revise our previously assigned useful life estimates attributed to any of our intangible assets in  or the estimated useful lives used in computing amortization of intangible assets are as follows customer relationships years developed technology years non compete agreement year tradenames years 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or an asset group may not be recoverable 
typical indicators  but not limited to  that an asset may be impaired include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
assets to be disposed of are recorded at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
recoverability measurement and estimating of undiscounted cash flows for assets to be held and used is done at the lowest possible levels for which there are identifiable assets 
if such assets are considered impaired  generally the amount of impairment recognized would be equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets  which we would compute using a discounted cash flow approach 
estimating future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our and recoverability measurements of long lived assets income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in the authoritative guidance for accounting for income taxes 
this method requires an asset and liability approach for the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred amounts are expected to be realized 
based upon our cumulative operating results through june  and an assessment of our expected future results of operations  we determined that there was significant positive evidence regarding the realization of our us deferred tax assets 
after weighing both the positive and negative evidence  coupled with the continued success in commercializing our core products and services both inside and outside the us  we believe that it is more likely than not that our us deferred tax assets will be realized 
a portion of the us valuation allowance was released in the period ended june  based on the amount of us net deferred tax assets then expected to be remaining as of december  as of december   we reversed all of the remaining valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets because it was more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized 
the release of the us valuation allowance was recorded as a tax benefit on our consolidated statement of operations for as of december   we had a remaining valuation allowance of approximately million  which primarily relates to certain foreign nols and tax credits that are not more likely than not to be realized 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions and are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon 
table of contents settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
changes in facts and circumstances could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs 
the asu is the result of joint efforts by the fasb and the international accounting standards board iasb to develop a single  converged fair value framework 
while the asu is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles in us gaap  it expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments 
key additional disclosures include quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs in level measures  qualitative information about sensitivity of level measures and valuation process  and classification within the fair value hierarchy for instruments where fair value is only disclosed in the footnotes but the carrying amount is on some other basis 
for public companies  the asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we do not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  it requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
under the two statement approach  the first statement would include components of net income  which is consistent with the income statement format used today  and the second statement would include components of other comprehensive income oci 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in oci 
asu is effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which simplifies the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment 
this guidance will allow companies to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we are currently evaluating this guidance  but do not expect its adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

other expense for was similarly relatively unchanged as compared to we do not anticipate incurring significant other income expense in the future  because of the conversion of our preferred stock warrants into warrants to purchase common stock in connection with the closing of the ipo  as a result of which  we are no longer required to recognize the change in fair value of such warrants as other income expense

borrowings and credit facilities convertible senior notes in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
the notes are our senior unsecured obligations  with interest payable semi annually in cash at a rate of per annum  and will mature on july   unless earlier repurchased  redeemed or converted 

table of contents the initial conversion rate for the notes is approximately per share 
the conversion price will be subject to adjustment in some events  but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
upon conversion  we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and deliver shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of the conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted 
conversion prior to april  note holders may convert their notes at their option prior to april  only if any of the following occur if  for ten consecutive trading days  the trading price per note is less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the applicable conversion rate of the notes on such day  then the notes may be converted at any time during the five business days following such ten day period  if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price of the notes for at least of the final trading days of a calendar quarter  then the notes may be converted at any time during the following calendar quarter  upon the occurrence of certain corporate events specified in the indenture governing the notes  or the indenture  or if we call the notes for redemption 
conversion on or after april  the notes will be convertible  regardless of the foregoing circumstances  at any time on or after april  through the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date 
redemption by holders holders of the notes may require us to repurchase some or all of the notes for cash  subject to certain exceptions  upon a fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  at a repurchase price equal to the principal amount of the notes being repurchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to but excluding the relevant repurchase date 
in addition  if a make whole fundamental change  as defined in the indenture  occurs prior to the maturity date  we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change 
redemption by broadsoft we may not redeem the notes prior to july  beginning july   we may redeem for cash all or part of the notes except for the notes that we are required to repurchase as described above if the last reported sale price of our common stock exceeds of the applicable conversion price of the notes for at least of the final trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of the redemption notice 
the redemption price of any notes we call for redemption prior to the maturity date will equal the sum of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus a make whole premium payment 
bank of america installment loan we have an installment loan with bank of america  in the original principal amount of million  to finance the payment of a one time license and maintenance fee in connection with our license of certain third party software 
the interest rate on the loan is fixed at 
the loan provides for scheduled quarterly principal repayments of million with the final principal payment due on april  as of december   the liability for the installment bank loan was approximately million 

table of contents tekes loan in connection with our acquisition of movial in october  we assumed five installment loans with tekes the finnish funding agency for technology and innovation in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the terms of the loans are governed by the finnish act on state lending and state guarantees  government decree on research  development and innovation funding 
the loans are for funding approved research and development projects  repayment terms are determined on a per project basis  and the interest rate on each loan is variable  which is currently three percent 
we expect to repay these loans in full during operating and capital expenditure requirements we believe the cash generated from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment balances and interest income we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next months 
in the future  we expect our operating and capital expenditures to grow as we increase headcount  expand our business activities  grow our customer base and implement and enhance our information technology and enterprise resource planning system 
as sales grow  we expect our accounts receivable balance to increase 
any such increase in accounts receivable may not be completely offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which would likely result in greater working capital requirements 
if our available cash resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or convertible debt securities or enter into a credit facility 
the sale of equity and convertible debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common shares 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt securities  these securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts 
additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations for non cancelable office space  notes payable and other short term and long term liabilities 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations as of december  and periods in which payments are due in thousands payments due by year total beyond convertible senior notes  including interest operating lease obligations bank of america installment loan equipment leases total contractual interest obligations related to our notes totaled million at december   including million  million  million and million due in years   and after  respectively 
as of december   we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  which did not include any interest or penalties 
we do not expect to recognize any of these benefits in furthermore  we are not able to provide a reliable estimate of the timing of future payments relating to these unrecognized benefits 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative  hedging or trading purposes  although in the future we may enter into interest rate or exchange rate hedging arrangements to manage the risks described below 
interest rate risk the interest rate is fixed on all outstanding loan balances  so we do not have exposure to risks due to increases in the variable rates tied to indexes 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of highly liquid short term money market funds  which we consider to be cash equivalents  in addition to a small portion of long term investments that have a maturity of less than two years 
our restricted cash consists primarily of certificates of deposit that secure letters of credit related to operating leases for office space 
these securities and investments earn interest at variable rates and  as a result  decreases in market interest rates would generally result in decreased interest income 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the high investment quality and relatively short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales contracts are currently denominated in us dollars 
therefore  we have minimal foreign currency exchange risk with respect to our revenue 
with international operations  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and if our exposure increases  adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
historically  our primary exposures have been related to non us dollar denominated operating expenses in canada  europe and the apac region 
as a result  our results of operations would generally be adversely affected by a decline in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies 
however  we believe this exposure is not material at this time 
as we continue to grow our international operations  our exposure to foreign currency risk could become more significant 
we do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risk of exchange rate fluctuations
