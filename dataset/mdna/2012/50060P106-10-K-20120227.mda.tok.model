table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products and services 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  concrete and steel industries 
we serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  with manufacturing facilities located in the united states  australia  china  the united kingdom  denmark and the netherlands 
we operate two principal businesses carbon materials chemicals cm c and railroad utility products r up 
through our cm c business  we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote  naphthalene and phthalic anhydride  which are intermediate materials necessary in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood and the production of carbon black  the production of high strength concrete  and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
through our r up business  we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the north american railroads 
our other commercial wood treatment products include utility poles for the electric and telephone utility industries 
we also provide rail joint bar products as well as various services to the railroad industry 
our cm c business has entered into a number of strategic transactions during the last two years to expand and focus on its core business related to coal tar distillation and derived products 
in march  we completed the acquisition of cindu chemicals bv  a coal tar distillation company located in the netherlands 
this company was subsequently renamed koppers netherlands bv koppers netherlands 
in october we also purchased the midwestern united states refined tar business of stella jones inc to increase our presence in this market 
our r up business purchased the rail joint bar business of portec rail products  inc located in huntington  west virginia in december this acquisition strengthens our product portfolio offerings to our existing class i and commercial railroad customers in the united states 
outlook trend overview our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products both in the united states and overseas  ii raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which is negatively impacted by reductions in steel production  iii volatility in oil prices  which impacts the cost of coal tar and certain other raw materials  as well as selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  iv competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  and v changes in foreign exchange rates 
our businesses and results of operations were impacted by the global recession starting in late and while there has been considerable improvement  still have not fully recovered 
certain key end markets experienced significant global reductions in demand that have negatively impacted the profitability for some of our products during that period 
during and our key end markets showed increased stability for our carbon materials chemicals business 
during we saw the idling or closure of several aluminum smelters  particularly in north america and europe  as global production of aluminum declined over previous levels 
however  in late several north american smelters announced that they were planning to increase production and restart some of their previously idled capacity during  which benefited our carbon pitch sales volumes in for  our volumes of carbon pitch increased in all geographic areas where we operate  however  while we have generally been able to recover raw material cost increases on a dollar for dollar basis  we have not been able to maintain the profit margins that were achieved prior to the global economic downturn in additionally  our increased presence in asia in response to the global shift in aluminum production to areas with low cost energy such as the middle east has had a dilutive effect on our margins due to market conditions in that region as well as the joint venture ownership structures of our chinese operations that serve this market 

table of contents our australian carbon black business experienced reduced profitability due to reduced raw material availability and the strengthening of the australian dollar relative to the united states dollar  as the majority of sales for these products are exported and are denominated in us dollars 
as a result of these conditions  a review of this business was conducted that resulted in the decision in december to permanently cease production and close the facility 
impairment and closure charges of approximately million were incurred for this facility in the fourth quarter of on february   a leak of material from a storage tank containing coal tar pitch was detected at its terminal facility in portland  victoria  australia 
all of the coal tar pitch was contained within the tank farm area and no release of material to water or soil occurred 
the company is unable  at this time  to reasonably estimate the financial effect of the event  if any 
the facility is part of the carbon materials chemicals segment 
on february   the company announced its intention to close its wood treating facility in grenada  mississippi effective on or around july  the company estimates that it will incur charges of approximately million over the next two years to close this facility which is part of the railroad utility products segment 
several of our products  particularly carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  have end market pricing that is linked to oil 
historically  we have benefited in terms of revenues and profitability from the higher pricing for these products as the cost of coal tar has not increased proportionally with oil 
however over the past few years our coal tar costs have been more strongly impacted by oil prices  which results in higher costs for our coal tar when oil prices increase 
the availability of coal tar is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production 
as the global steel industry has reduced production of steel and metallurgical coke the volumes of coal tar by product were also reduced 
our ability to obtain coal tar and the price we are able to negotiate have a significant impact on the level of profitability of our business 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs can result in margin dilution if only the increased cost of the raw material is passed on to the customer 
additionally  in certain regions such as china that have competing markets for coal tar  or in regions where the available supply of our products exceeds demand  we may not be able to recover raw material cost increases in the selling prices for our end products 
seasonality and effects of weather on operations our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have been halted for short periods of time during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results have been significantly lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
we expect this seasonality trend to continue in future periods 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  consolidated results net sales for the years ended december  and are summarized by segment in the following table year ended december  net change dollars in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products

cost of sales was negatively impacted by restructuring charges of related to the closure of our carbon black facility in australia 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million higher when compared to the prior year period due to an impairment charge of million related to the closure of our carbon black facility in australia 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million higher when compared to the prior year period due primarily to higher compensation related expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million higher when compared to the prior year period reflecting a small increase in the average level of borrowing in income taxes for the year ended december  were million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the decrease in pretax income of million as compared to the prior year 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was percent as compared to the prior year period of percent 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate is primarily due to a million restructuring and impairment charge related to our australian carbon black facility that generated a tax benefit at a percent tax rate partially offset by a million tax reserve associated with our european restructuring project

table of contents carbon materials pricing for carbon pitch decreased five percent due to lower demand and excess pitch availability 
offsetting this decrease were higher sales volumes of carbon pitch from chinese operations of five percent and europe of three percent due primarily to the acquisition in the netherlands 
the volume increases are due to increased worldwide demand for aluminum products and the increased production from our chinese operations to supply carbon pitch to smelters in the middle east 
distillate pricing for carbon black feedstock increased two percent in europe due to higher average worldwide oil prices as compared to the prior year 
the increase in distillate sales volume is due to the acquisition in the netherlands 
for coal tar chemicals  increases in phthalic anhydride prices in the us of three percent and naphthalene prices of one percent were experienced

table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report restrictions on dividends to koppers holdings koppers holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of koppers inc and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations  including the payment of any declared dividend of koppers holdings 
koppers inc s credit agreement prohibits it from making dividend payments to us unless such dividend payments are permitted by the indenture governing koppers inc s senior notes and no event of default or potential default has occurred or is continuing under the credit agreement 
the indenture governing koppers inc s senior notes restricts its ability to finance our payment of dividends if a default has occurred or would result from such financing  a restricted subsidiary of koppers inc which is not a guarantor under the indenture is not able to incur additional indebtedness as defined in the indenture  and the sum of all restricted payments as defined in the indenture have exceeded the permitted amount which we refer to as the basket at such point in time 
the basket is governed by a formula based on the sum of a beginning amount  plus or minus a percentage of koppers inc s consolidated net income as defined in the indenture  plus the net proceeds of koppers inc s qualified stock issuance or conversions of debt to qualified stock  plus the net proceeds from the sale of or a reduction in an investment as defined in the indenture or the value of the assets of an unrestricted subsidiary which is designated a restricted subsidiary 
at december  the basket totaled million 
notwithstanding such restrictions  the indenture governing koppers inc s senior notes permits an additional aggregate amount of million each fiscal year to finance dividends on the capital stock of koppers holdings  whether or not there is any basket availability  provided that at the time of such payment  no default in the indenture has occurred or would result from financing the dividends 
in addition  certain required coverage ratios in koppers inc s revolving credit facility may restrict the ability of koppers inc to pay dividends 
see debt covenants 
the ability of koppers inc to pay dividends to us  and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders  is also restricted by pennsylvania law 
under pennsylvania law  a corporation has the power  subject to restrictions in its bylaws  to pay dividends or make other distributions to its shareholders unless  after giving effect thereto  the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or the corporation s assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus unless otherwise provided in its articles the amount that would be needed upon the dissolution of the corporation to satisfy the preferential rights  if any  of the shareholders having superior preferential rights to the shareholders receiving the distribution 
in determining whether a particular level of dividends is permitted under pennsylvania law  the board of directors may base its conclusion on one or more of the following the book values of the assets and liabilities of the company as reflected on its books and records  a valuation that takes into consideration unrealized appreciation  depreciation or other changes in value of the assets and liabilities of the company  the current value of the assets and liabilities of the company either valued separately or valued in segments or as an entirety as a going concern  or any other method that is reasonable in the circumstances 
our bylaws and articles and those of koppers inc contain no restrictions regarding dividends 
liquidity the koppers inc revolving credit facility agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million at variable interest rates 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of the assets of koppers inc and its material domestic subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants for koppers inc and its restricted subsidiaries that limit capital expenditures  additional indebtedness  liens  dividends and investments or acquisitions 
in addition  such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by koppers inc and its restricted subsidiaries to meet certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company had million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments 
as of december   million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit

our estimated liquidity was million at december  the increase in estimated liquidity from that date is due primarily to an increase in cash and an increase in the availability under the revolving credit facility due to an improvement in covenant restriction calculations 
as of december   we had million aggregate amount of common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants or a combination of these securities available to be issued under our registration statement on form s filed in our need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service  purchase commitments and operating leases  as well as for working capital  capital maintenance programs  plant closures and mandatory defined benefit plan funding 
we may also use cash to pursue potential strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  are expected to total approximately million 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that the foregoing sources are not sufficient to fund our expenditures and service our indebtedness  we would be required to raise additional funds

recently issued accounting guidance there is no recently issued accounting guidance that is expected to have a material impact on our financial results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
our management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or when title passes to the customer 
we recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon transfer of title  which occurs upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer 
service revenue  consisting primarily of wood treating services  is recognized at the time the service is provided 
our recognition of revenue with respect to untreated crossties meets all the 
table of contents recognition criteria of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin topic a  including transfer of title and risk of ownership  the existence of fixed purchase commitments and delivery schedules established by the customer and the completion of all performance obligations by us 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
in the united states  cm c and r up inventories are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
inventories outside the united states are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the first in  first out basis fifo  or market 
market represents replacement cost for raw materials and net realizable value for work in process and finished goods 
lifo inventories constituted approximately percent of the fifo inventory value at december  and long lived assets 
our management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  based on a number of factors including operating results  projected future cash flows and business plans 
we record long lived assets at the lower of cost or fair value  with fair value based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of fixed assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
in making this assessment  management relies on various factors  including operating results  estimated future cash flows  and business plans 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
because management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated 
goodwill valuations are performed using projected operating results of the relevant reporting units 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
additionally  disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
at december  our balance sheet included million of deferred tax assets  net of an million valuation allowance 
we have determined that this valuation allowance is required for our deferred tax assets based on future earnings projections 
to the extent that we encounter unexpected difficulties in market conditions  adverse changes in regulations affecting our businesses and operations  adverse outcomes in legal and environmental matters  or any other unfavorable conditions  the projections for future taxable income may be overstated and we may be required to record an increase in the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on income in the future 
accrued insurance 
we are insured for property  casualty and workers compensation insurance up to various stop loss amounts after meeting required retention levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the liability for the related retentions for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience 
in the event we incur a significant number of losses beyond the coverage retention limits  additional expense beyond the actuarial projections would be required 
asset retirement obligations 
we measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance  using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks 
in the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates  we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues 
pension and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided far into the future and allocating that cost over the time period each employee works 
this calculation requires extensive use of assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns  mortality  medical costs  employee turnover and discount rates 
in determining the expected return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate long term actual return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and estimates of future investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  we take into consideration a number of factors including our actual 
table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report health care cost increases  the design of our benefit programs  the characteristics of our active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates 
because these items require our management s judgment  the related liabilities currently recorded by us could be lower or higher than amounts ultimately required to be paid 
litigation and contingencies 
we record liabilities related to legal matters when an adverse outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent we anticipate favorable outcomes to these matters which ultimately result in adverse outcomes  we could incur material adverse impacts on earnings and cash flows 
because such matters require significant judgments on the part of management  the recorded liabilities could be lower than what is ultimately required 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including  among other things  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  the discharge of effluent into waterways  the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters 
we expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third party claims  or otherwise incur costs  relating to cleanup of  or for injuries resulting from  contamination at sites associated with past and present operations 
we accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage the interest rate risks  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
this reduces the impact of short term fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  we enter into foreign currency debt instruments that are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating currencies on net income and equity 
we also use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments up to twelve months and all such contracts are marked to market with the recognition of a gain or loss at each reporting period 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our financial instruments and foreign operations to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  and the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
these forward looking statements are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments and foreign operations 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have fixed and variable rate debt and the ability to incur variable rate debt under the koppers inc credit agreement 
at december  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt and at december   we had million of fixed rate debt 
our ratio of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at december  was approximately two percent 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels and foreign exchange rates  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  and would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the earnings and cash flows for the next year assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease approximately million  holding other variables constant 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis 
our exchange rate exposures result primarily from our investment and ongoing operations in australia  denmark  the netherlands  china and the united kingdom 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent reduction in all relevant exchange rates  the effect on our earnings  based on actual earnings from foreign operations for the years ended december  and  would be reductions of approximately million and million  respectively
