net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased million to million for the year ended december  due to higher ncm llc net income partially offset by the impact of the redemption of common membership units during the third quarter of known trends and uncertainties the current macro economic environment and its impact on national television scatter advertising market in general  present uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  including the timing and amount of spending from our national advertising clients 
the impact to our business associated with these issues will be mitigated somewhat over time due to factors including the growth in our advertising client base  the effectiveness of cinema advertising relative to other advertising mediums  and the effectiveness and increasing scale of our national network and the related increase in salable advertising impressions and fathom live broadcast locations 
during we have added consolidated theatres acquired by regal in  as well as several new affiliates including ayrsley theatre operators  coming attractions theatres  inc  digital cinema destinations  corp  
table of contents itbs southeast cinemas  odyssey entertainment  inc cinemagic theatres  rave cinemas  llc  showplex cinemas  inc  and vss southern theatres 
during the first quarter of we will add cinema centers  dickinson theatres  inc  additional far away entertainment brainbridge theatres  king theatres  star cinema grill and texas cinemas  as well as additional galaxy theatres 
in total  these contracted new founding member and affiliate theatres that have joined our network since the beginning of are expected to add approximately million new attendees on a full year pro forma basis  which we expect will result in approximately million new salable national advertising impressions assuming national advertising units of seconds each 
our sales force integrates these additional impressions into the advertising sales process as they are added to our network and thus these attendees will provide the opportunity to expand our revenue  operating income and cash flow in and beyond 
we are discussing network affiliate relationships with other theatre circuits that could be signed during and are expected to add additional attendees and advertising impressions to our network in and beyond 
we believe that the continued growth of our network will strengthen our selling proposition and competitive positioning versus other national and regional advertising platforms 
under the esas  up to seconds of the firstlook program can be sold to our founding members to satisfy their on screen advertising commitments under their beverage concessionaire agreements 
during and in  we sold seconds to our founding members 
we expect to continue to sell seconds of time to the founding members in in consideration for ncm llc s access to the founding members theatre attendees for on screen advertising and use of off screen locations within the founding members theatres for the lobby entertainment network and lobby promotions  the founding members receive a monthly theatre access fee under the esas 
the theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron and a fixed payment per digital screen 
the payment per theatre patron will increase by every five years with the first such increase taking effect for fiscal year and the payment per digital screen increases annually by 
the theatre access fee paid in the aggregate to all founding members cannot be less than of ncm llc s aggregate advertising revenue as defined in the esa  or it will be adjusted upward to reach this minimum payment 
beginning on october   the theatre access fee paid to the members of ncm llc included an additional fee for access to the higher quality digital cinema systems for our advertising and fathom business pursuant to an amendment of the esas entered into during  which will increase in as additional screens will be equipped with the new digital cinema equipment 
during early  we restructured fathom events to place more focus on the fathom consumer division 
based on historical and expected future trends we believe the fathom consumer division has greater future growth prospects and is more aligned with the movie exhibition business and our strategy of becoming a more powerful digital media platform 
the company will continue to operate the fathom business division for a portion of the first quarter of to satisfy contractual obligations for events 
despite the revenue loss million in  due to the reduction in direct expenses as well as indirect expenses such as operating  selling and marketing and administrative costs  the impact on our future operating income and adjusted oibda is not expected to be material 
in july we amended our credit facility agreement and completed a private placement and subsequent exchange for registered notes of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in a portion of the proceeds were used to prepay million of unhedged outstanding term loan borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  with the remainder used to pay transaction expenses and repay borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
in conjunction with this bond placement we also restructured our existing revolving credit agreement by expanding the availability from million to million and extending the term from february  to december  as a result of these transactions  we have extended the maturities of our debt as well as increased our liquidity 
due primarily to the higher interest rate on the bonds versus our senior secured credit facility term loan  we expect our interest expense on borrowings to increase by approximately million for the year compared to the year 
the first semi annual payment on our new senior notes was january  subsequent to the placement of 
table of contents the senior notes  our only variable rate debt relates to our million revolving credit agreement  of which million was outstanding at december  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document  ncm llc s calendar years and tax returns are currently under examination by the irs and in september  ncm llc received a notice of proposed adjustment nopa for the calendar year examination primarily related to characterization of the cash received by the founding members at or around the date of the company s ipo 
as ncm llc is a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes  there will be no direct impact to the financial statements of ncm llc 
however  there could be an impact to the financial statements of ncm  inc the impact of any adjustment could result in ncm  inc recognizing its proportionate share of the changes in the tax basis in ncm llc 
this could result in a net increase in deferred tax assets and equity of ncm  inc ncm llc strongly disagrees with  and will contest  the irs positions 
should the irs claims prevail  the company could be required to pay additional amounts to the founding members under the tax sharing agreement and then could request refunds from various federal and state taxing authorities  and thus it is not expected to have an adverse impact on cash balances or cash flow of the company 
our net income and earnings per share could fluctuate significantly with interest rate movements 
for example  the change in derivative fair value included in our results of operations decreased  or million  to a million non cash charge for the year ended december  compared to million non cash for the year ended december  due to fluctuations in market interest rates 
we believe these fluctuations are reasonably likely to continue 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note included elsewhere in this document 
our effective tax rate for the years ended december   december  and december  was  and  respectively 
our tax rate is affected by recurring items and the relative amount of income that ncm  inc earns in various state and local jurisdictions  which we expect to be fairly consistent in the near term 
it is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year  but are not consistent from year to year

the senior notes have a maturity date of july  and pay interest semi annually in arrears on january and july of each year  commencing january  the proceeds were used to prepay million of ncm llc s outstanding indebtedness under its existing senior secured credit facility discussed above  as well as pay million on the existing revolving line of credit and pay offering costs 
the outstanding balance of the senior notes at december  was million 
the notes are subordinated to all existing and future secured debt  including indebtedness under the company s existing senior secured credit facility 
critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and are evaluated on an ongoing basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in its trade receivables  which represent a significant asset on the balance sheet 
estimating the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions and debtor specific factors  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
account receivable balances are charged against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged are credited to the allowance 
a provision for bad debt is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for bad debt could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
share based compensation 
the company s equity incentive plan is treated as an equity plan under the provisions of accounting standards codification asc compensation stock compensation  and the determination of fair value of options and non vested stock for accounting purposes requires that management make complex estimates and judgments 

table of contents we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our options 
this model requires that the company make estimates of various factors used 
the following assumptions were used in the valuation of the options expected life of options the expected life of the options is determined by using the average of the vesting and contractual terms of the options 
due to the short length of time over which our options have been outstanding  the company has not developed a historical option exercise experience and has determined that the simplified method is a reasonable basis to estimate the expected life of the options 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is determined by using the applicable treasury rates as of the grant dates  commensurate with the expected terms of the options 
expected volatility ncm closed its ipo on february  since the length of time our shares have been publicly traded is shorter than the contractual terms of our options  we believe historical volatility may not be completely representative of future stock price trends 
as a result  we derive a weighted expected volatility based on comparable companies as well as on our historical volatility 
dividend yield the estimated dividend yield was determined using management s expectations based on estimated cash flow characteristics and expected long term dividend policy 
certain of the non vested stock awards include performance vesting conditions  which permit vesting to the extent that the company achieves specified non gaap targets at the end of the measurement period 
compensation expense is based on management s projections and the probability of achievement of those expectations  which requires considerable judgement 
we record a cumulative adjustment to share based compensation expense in periods that we change our estimate of the number of shares expected to vest 
additionally  we ultimately adjust the expense recognized to reflect the actual vested shares following the resolution of the performance conditions 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from the differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax amounts are determined using the tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes will actually be paid or refunds received  as provided under currently enacted tax law 
valuation allowances are to be established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we currently have a million valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets as we believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such assets in future periods as we do not expect offsetting capital gains 
in addition  due to the basis differences resulting from our ipo related transactions including the tax receivable agreement with our founding members and subsequent adjustments pursuant to the common unit adjustment agreement  we are required to make cash payments under the tax receivable agreement to the founding members in amounts equal to of our actual tax benefit realized from the tax amortization of the basis difference for certain deferred assets noted above 
the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  as amended  are highly technical and complex and involve management s judgment  including judgments to determine hypothetical tax outcomes exclusive of the ipo date transaction and agreements 
if we were to fail to meet certain of the requirements of the tax receivable agreement  we could be subject to additional payments to taxing authorities or to our founding members 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
ncm llc s calendar years and tax returns are currently under examination by tax authorities

no revenue guarantee amounts have ever been paid under these agreements and no liabilities were recorded as of december  for additional details see the information provided under note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this document 
the tax receivable agreement entered into at the completion of our ipo provides for the payment by us to the founding members of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of certain increases in our proportionate share of tax 
table of contents basis in ncm llc s tangible and intangible assets 
the payments to the founding members are based  in part  on actual annual income and as such  will vary based on our operating results 
the value in the table represents the estimated amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as of december  the tax receivable agreement described in note above was discounted and recorded at present value 
the value in the table represents the estimated accretion of interest on the discounted payable as of december  the amended and restated esas entered into at the completion of our ipo require payments based on a combination of founding member attendance and the number of digital screens of each founding member 
the amount relating to the attendance factor will vary from quarter to quarter and year to year as theatre attendance varies while the amount relating to the screens factor will be more predictable but will also vary quarter to quarter and year to year as screens are converted to digital screens and other screens are added or removed through acquisition  divestiture or closure activities of the founding members 
the payments made to founding members also will vary due to the escalation of the rates paid for each factor pursuant to the amended and restated esas 
the rate per attendee increases every five years beginning in  while the rate per digital screen increases annually 
the table above does not include amounts payable under the amended and restated esas as they are based on variable factors  which are not capable of precise estimation 
seasonality our revenue and operating results are seasonal in nature  coinciding with the timing of marketing expenditures by our advertising clients and to a lesser extent the attendance patterns within the film exhibition industry as well as the timing and the number of fathom events 
advertising expenditures and theatre attendance tend to be higher during the second  third  and fourth fiscal quarters and are correlated to theatre attendance levels and new product releases and advertising client marketing priorities and cycles 
the actual quarterly results for each quarter could differ materially depending on these factors or other risks and uncertainties 
based on our historical experience  our first quarter typically has less revenue than the other quarters of a given year due primarily to lower advertising client demand and lower theatre industry attendance levels 
accordingly  there can be no assurances that seasonal variations will not materially affect our results of operations in the future 
the following table reflects the quarterly percentage of total revenue for the fiscal years ended and first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter fy fy item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
we have entered into variable to fixed interest rate swap arrangements economically hedging the entire million term loan outstanding at a fixed interest rate of 
the senior notes due in are at a fixed rate  and therefore are not subject to market risk 
at december  the only interest rate risk that we are exposed to is related to our million revolving credit facility and thus a basis point fluctuation in market interest rates would have the effect of increasing or decreasing our cash interest expense by approximately million for an annual period on the million outstanding on our revolver 
because each of our interest rate swaps was in a liability position at december   we are not currently exposed to counterparty risk related to the swaps
