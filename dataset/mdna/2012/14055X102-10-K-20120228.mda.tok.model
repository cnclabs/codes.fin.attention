table of contents the average yields for investment securities available for sale were calculated based on the amortized costs of the individual securities and do not reflect any changes in fair value  which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the average yields for investment securities held to maturity have also been calculated using amortized cost balances 
average loan balances are net of deferred fees and discounts on loans 
non accrual loans have been included in the average loan balances to determine the average yield earned on loans 
for the year ended december   there was no interest expense related to liabilities of discontinued operations

as a result  all consolidated comparisons below reflect the continuing results of our operations 
income from discontinued operations decreased to million  including a gain on disposal of million  for the year ended december  from million  including a loss on disposal of million  net of tax  for the year ended december  for additional information  see note  discontinued operations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  income taxes we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
for the tax years ended december  and  our subsidiaries were not able to participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
as a result  certain subsidiaries had taxable income that was not offset by taxable losses or loss carryforwards of other entities 
we intend to reconsolidate our subsidiaries for federal tax purposes when we file our federal tax return 
we are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates for the periods in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the change 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if the establishment of a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when 
table of contents making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earning trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
in  we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets for subsidiaries where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the incurrence of operating losses at several of our subsidiaries  and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
as of december  and  the total valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets of million as of december  will be realized 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance with respect to our deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reduction or reversal 
vs 
consolidated income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in the net deferred tax assets of one of our corporate entities 
the tax benefit for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the carryback of the net operating loss of one of our corporate entities 
vs 
consolidated income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the change in income tax expense was caused primarily by the establishment of valuation allowances at several corporate entities during that did not recur in  and the carryback of a net operating loss of one of our corporate entities in comparison of the years ended december   and certain amounts in the prior year s audited consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  including modifying the presentation of our audited consolidated statements of operations to include the captions of non interest income and non interest expense as compared to operating expenses and other income expense

there were no non accrual real estate construction loans held for sale as of december  and excludes non accrual loans and accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
the decrease in the non performing loan balance from december  to december  is primarily due to payoffs  charge offs  sales and foreclosures on those loans  and a decrease in the number of loans that became non performing during potential problem loans are loans that are not considered non performing loans  as disclosed above  but loans where management is aware of information regarding potential credit problems of a borrower that leads to serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
such defaults could 
table of contents eventually result in the loans being reclassified as non performing loans 
as of december   we had million in potential problem loans related to loans for which we have determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement  but we have concluded that repayment in full of the loans is fully supported by existing collateral or an enterprise valuation of the borrower in accordance with our most recent valuation analysis 
as of december   we had million in potential problem loans  primarily related to an impaired loan that was restructured during the first quarter of of our non accrual loans  million were days delinquent and million were over days delinquent as of december   and million were days delinquent and million were over days delinquent as of december  accruing loans days delinquent were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
most of our real estate construction loans include an interest reserve that is established upon origination of the loan 
we recognize interest income from the reserve during the construction period as long as the interest is deemed collectible 
as part of our ongoing credit review process  we monitor the construction of the underlying real estate to determine whether the project is progressing as originally planned 
if we determine that adverse changes have occurred such that full payment of principal and interest is no longer expected  we will place the loan on non accrual status and establish a specific reserve or charge off a portion of the principal balance  as appropriate 
we maintain a comprehensive credit policy manual that is supplemented by specific loan product underwriting guidelines 
among other things  the credit policy manual sets forth requirements that meet the regulations enforced by both the fdic and the dfi 
several examples of such requirements are the loan to value limitations for real estate secured loans  various real estate appraisal and other third party reports standards  and collateral insurance requirements 
our underwriting guidelines outline specific underwriting standards and minimum specific risk acceptance criteria for each lending product offered  including the use of interest reserves 
for additional information  see credit risk management within this section 
we maintain servicing procedures for real estate construction loans  and the objective of the procedures is to maintain the proper relationship between the loan amount funded and the value of the collateral securing the loan 
the principal servicing tasks include  but are not limited to monitoring construction of the project to evaluate the work in place  quality of construction compliance with plans and specifications and adequacy of the budget to complete the project 
we generally use a third party consultant for this evaluation  but also maintain frequent contact with the borrower to obtain updates on the project 
monitoring compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement  which contains important construction and leasing provisions 
reviewing and approving advance requests per the loan agreement which establishes the frequency  conditions and process for making advances 
typically  each loan advance is conditioned upon funding only for work in place  certification by the construction consultant  and sufficient funds remaining in the loan budget to complete the project 
additionally  our risk rating policies require that the assignment of a risk rating should consider whether the capitalization of interest may be masking other performance related issues 
the adequacy of the interest reserve generally is evaluated each time a risk rating conclusion is required or rendered with particular attention paid to the underlying value of the collateral and its ongoing support of the transaction 
obtaining updated third party valuations is considered when significant negative variances to expected performance exist 
generally  our policy 
table of contents on updating appraisals is to obtain current appraisals subsequent to the impairment date if there are significant changes to the underlying assumptions from the most recent appraisal 
some factors that could cause significant changes include the passage of more than twelve months since the time of the last appraisal  the volatility of the local market  the availability of financing  the number of competing properties  new improvements to or lack of maintenance of the subject property or competing surrounding properties  a change in zoning  environmental contamination  or failure of the project to meet material assumptions of the original appraisal 
we generally consider appraisals to be current if they are dated within the past twelve months 
however  we may obtain an updated appraisal on a more frequent basis if in our determination there are significant changes to the underlying assumptions from the most recent appraisal 
as of december   million of our collateral dependent loans had an appraisal older than twelve months 
the fair value of the collateral for these loans was determined through inputs outside of appraisals  including actual and comparable sales transactions  broker price opinions and other relevant data 
five of the loans that comprise our real estate construction portfolio as of december  have been extended  renewed or restructured since origination 
these modifications have occurred for various reasons including  but not limited to  changes in business plans and or work out efforts that were best achieved via a restructuring 
in considering the performing status of a real estate construction loan  the current payment of interest  whether in cash or through an interest reserve  is only one of the factors used in our analysis 
our impairment analysis generally considers the loan s maturity  the likelihood of a restructuring of the loan and if that restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  whether the borrower is current on interest and principal payments  the condition of underlying assets and the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at market terms 
although an interest reserve may mitigate a delinquency that could cause impairment  other issues with the loan or borrower may lead to an impairment determination 
impairment is then measured based on a fair market or discounted cash flow value to assess the current value of the loan relative to the principal balance 
if the valuation analysis indicates that repayment in full is doubtful  the loan will be placed on non accrual status and designated as non performing

the carrying values of our impaired loans reflect incurred losses that are inherent in our loan portfolio 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
in this regard  impaired loans include those loans where we expect to encounter a significant delay in the collection of  and or shortfall in the amount of contractual payments due to us as well as loans that we have assessed as impaired  but for which we ultimately expect to collect all payments 
we employ a formal quarterly process to both identify impaired loans and record appropriate specific reserves based on available collateral and other borrower specific information

table of contents we believe the origination strategy and underwriting practices in place support a loan portfolio with normal  acceptable degrees of credit risk 
we acknowledge  however  that some of our lending products have greater credit risk than others 
the categories with more credit risk than others are those that have comprised a greater degree of our historical charge offs 
for the years ended december  and  commercial real estate loans  excluding healthcare real estate loans  originated prior to the bank s july inception comprised and  respectively  of those years charge offs 
as such  we believe commercial real estate loans  excluding healthcare real estate loans  originated prior to the bank s july inception have a higher degree of credit risk than other lending products in our portfolio 
as of december  and  commercial real estate loans  excluding healthcare real estate loans  originated prior to the bank s july inception totaled million and million  respectively  or and of total loans  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  loans with an aggregate carrying value of million and million  respectively  as of their respective restructuring dates  were involved in tdrs 
loans involved in these tdrs are assessed as impaired  generally for a period of at least one year following the restructuring  assuming the loan performs under the restructured terms and the restructured terms were at market 
the specific reserves allocated to loans that were involved in tdrs were million as of december  there were no specific reserves allocated to loans that were involved in tdrs as of december  during  capitalsource bank restructured  in tdrs  three commercial real estate loans into new loans using an a note b note structure in which the b note component has been fully charged off 
the contractual principal balances of these three loans prior to the restructurings totaled million 
in connection with the restructurings  million of debt was forgiven and charged off  and million was collected as principal payments  leaving million of a notes and million of b notes 
in march  one of these a b note arrangements with an aggregate carrying value of million as of december  was repaid in full  including the previously charged off b note 
as of december   the aggregate carrying value of the remaining two a notes was million  and as of december   the aggregate carrying value of the three a notes was million 
the b notes had no aggregate carrying value as of december  and during the year ended december   the remaining two a notes that were tdrs with an aggregate carrying value of million were no longer considered as impaired as they performed in accordance with market based restructured terms for twelve consecutive months 
the workout strategy discussed above results in the a note equaling a balance the borrower can service and is underwritten to a loan to value ratio based on the current collateral valuation 
the a note may be assigned an internal risk rating of pass based on the revised terms and management s assessment of the borrower s ability and intent to repay 
the a note is structured at a market interest rate  and the a note debt service is typically covered by the in place property operations allowing it to be placed on accrual status 
the reduced loan amount induces the borrower to continue to support the loan and maintain the collateral despite the observed reduction in the collateral value 
the b note usually bears no interest or an interest rate significantly below the market rate 
the a note contains amortization provisions  and the b note requires amortization only after the full repayment of the a note 
accrual status for each loan  including restructured a notes  is considered on a loan by loan basis 
the newly established principal balance of the a note is set at a level where the borrower is expected to keep the loan current and where the underlying collateral value adequately supports the loan 
the revised structure is intended to allow the a loan to be placed on accrual status 
all loans that have undergone this a note b note restructuring are considered tdrs 
the a notes are deemed impaired and remain so classified for at least one year from the date of the restructuring 
after one year  the a notes are evaluated quarterly to determine if the loan performance has complied with the terms of the tdr such that the impairment classification may be removed

these arrangements had carrying amounts totaling million and million  respectively  and are included in other liabilities 
we also provide standby letters of credit under certain of our property leases 
in connection with certain securitization transactions  we have made customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets and collateral 
prior to any securitization transaction  we generally performed due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction and the collateral to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties

management level risk oversight while the board has ultimate oversight responsibility for our risk management  we have utilized management level committees to actively assess and manage risks across the company 
as of february  our board of directors established a formal enterprise wide management level enterprise risk management erm infrastructure that aligns with bank regulatory guidance 
the erm infrastructure is governed by a board approved erm policy and administered by a management erm committee ermc chaired by our chief compliance officer 
the ermc comprises executive and senior level management and reports to the board on enterprise wide risks and risk management 
the ermc is responsible for implementing risk identification  assessment and monitoring systems  where applicable  and has oversight responsibility for the processes that identify  measure  mitigate and report on the company s risk categories  including strategic  credit  liquidity  financial  market  regulatory compliance  legal  fraud  reputation  compensation and operational risks 
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a client s or counterparty s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our loan  lease and derivative portfolios and the portion of our investment portfolio comprised of non agency mbs  non agency abs and 
table of contents cmbs 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the client  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding with an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on the nature of the lending arrangement and management s assessment of the client  and by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
as appropriate  the bank credit committee evaluates and approves credit standards and oversees the credit risk management function related to our loans and other investments 
its primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring economic and market conditions having an impact on our credit related activities and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk and monitoring our client s financial condition and performance 
substantially all new loans have been originated at capitalsource bank  and we maintain a comprehensive credit policy manual for those loans that is supplemented by specific loan product underwriting guidelines 
among other things  the credit policy manual sets forth requirements that meet the regulations enforced by both the fdic and the dfi 
examples of such requirements include the loan to value limitations for real estate secured loans  standards for real estate appraisals and other third party reports and collateral insurance requirements 
our underwriting guidelines outline specific underwriting standards and minimum specific risk acceptance criteria for each lending product offered 
loan types defined within these guidelines have three broad categories  within our commercial  real estate and real estate construction loan portfolios 
these categories include asset based loans  cash flow loans and real estate loans  and each of these broad categories has specific subsections that define in detail the following loan structures  which includes the lien positions  amortization provisions and loan tenors  collateral descriptions and appropriate valuation methods  underwriting considerations which include minimum diligence and verification requirements  and specific risk acceptance criteria which enumerate for each loan type the minimum acceptable credit performance standards 
examples of these criteria include maximum loan to value amounts for real estate loans  maximum advance rate amounts for asset based loans and minimum historical and projected debt service coverage amounts for all loans 
we measure and document each loan s compliance with our specific risk acceptance criteria at underwriting 
if at underwriting  there is an exception to these criteria  an explanation of the factors that mitigate this additional risk is considered before an approval is granted 
credit risk management for the loan portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of a client based on an analysis of the client s payment performance  cash flow and financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a client  each credit exposure is assigned an internal risk rating that is subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the same factors financial performance  the ability to repay the loan and the collateral 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client s financial condition  cash flow or financial position 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within the loan portfolio 
in making decisions regarding credit  we consider risk rating  collateral and industry concentration limits 
we use a variety of tools to continuously monitor a client s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we syndicate loan exposure to other lenders  sell loans and use other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of our loan portfolio 

table of contents concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in lending activities with clients primarily throughout the united states 
as of december   the single largest industry concentration in our outstanding loan balance was health care and social assistance  which represented approximately of the outstanding loan portfolio 
as of december   taken in the aggregate  lender finance primarily timeshare loans were our largest loan concentration by sector and represented approximately of our loan portfolio 
as of december   real estate and real estate construction loans represented approximately of our outstanding loan portfolio 
among real estate and real estate construction loans  the largest property type concentration was the multi family category  comprising approximately  and the largest geographical concentration was in california  comprising approximately of this loan portfolio 
selected information pertaining to our largest credit relationships as of december  was as follows loan balance of total portfolio loan type industry amount of loan s at origination loan commitment performing specific reserves underlying collateral date of last collateral appraisal amount of last appraisal in thousands  commercial and real estate construction timeshare   partial timeshare receivables n a n a  real estate vacation resort club   yes portfolio of vacation properties various ranging from december to may   real estate health care and social assistance   yes nursing care facilities may  represents the primary collateral supporting the loan 
in certain cases  there may be additional types of collateral 
the collateral that secures our loan balance of million as of december  primarily consisted of timeshare receivables and timeshare real estate that had a total value of million as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  secured by the collateral was million as of december  this credit relationship includes multiple loans  one of which  with a balance of million  is non performing 
total senior debt  including our loan balance  was million as of december  our loan balance of million was net of a million charge off and was classified as held for sale as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  was million as of december  non performing loans in our portfolio of loans held for investment may include non accrual loans  accruing loans contractually past due  or tdrs 
our remediation efforts on these loans are based upon the characteristics of each specific situation 
the various remediation efforts that we may undertake include  among other things  one of or a combination of the following request that the equity owners of the borrower inject additional capital  require the borrower to provide us with additional collateral  request additional guaranties or letters of credit  request the borrower to improve cash flow by taking actions such as selling non strategic assets or reducing operating expenses  modify the terms of our debt  including the deferral of principal or interest payments  where we will appropriately classify the modification as a tdr  
table of contents initiate foreclosure proceedings on the collateral  or sell the loan in certain cases where there is an interested third party buyer 
there were credit relationships in the non performing portfolio as of december   and our largest non performing credit relationship totaled million and comprised of our total non performing loans 
tdrs are loans that have been restructured as a result of deterioration in the borrower s financial position and for which we have granted a concession to the borrower that we would not have otherwise granted if those conditions did not exist 
our concession strategies in tdrs are intended to minimize our economic losses as borrowers experience financial difficulty and provide an alternative to foreclosure 
the success of these strategies is highly dependent on our borrowers ability and willingness to repay under the restructured terms of their loans 
continued adverse changes in the economic environment or in borrower performance could negatively impact the outcome of these strategies 
a summary of concessions granted by loan type  including the accrual status of the loans as of december  and was as follows december  non accrual accrual total non accrual accrual total in thousands commercial interest rate and fee reduction maturity extension payment deferral multiple concessions real estate interest rate and fee reduction maturity extension payment deferral multiple concessions real estate construction maturity extension multiple concessions total we have experienced losses incurred on some tdrs subsequent to their initial restructuring 
these losses include both additional specific reserves and charge offs on the restructured loans 
the majority of such losses has been incurred on our commercial loans and is primarily due to the borrowers failure to consistently meet their financial forecasts that formed the bases for our restructured loans 
examples of circumstances that resulted in the borrowers not being able to meet their forecasts included acquisitions of other businesses that did not have the expected positive impact on financial results  significant delays in launching products and services  and continued deterioration in the pricing estimates of businesses and product lines that the borrower expected to sell to generate proceeds to repay the loan

derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan and lease losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from all counterparties based on terms stipulated in the collateral support annex 
we also monitor all exposure and collateral requirements 
table of contents daily on a per counterparty basis 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from counterparties and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their derivative positions net 
as of december  and  the gross positive fair value of our derivative financial instruments was million and million  respectively 
our master netting agreements reduced the exposure to this gross positive fair value by million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we held million and million of collateral against derivative financial instruments as of december  and  respectively 
market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate fluctuations 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities  including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk in our normal course of business refers to the change in earnings that may result from changes in interest rates  primarily various short term interest rates  including libor based rates and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our lending and borrowing on a variable rate basis 
the majority of our loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the libor rate or a prime based rate with most of the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
approximately half of our borrowings bear interest at a spread to libor or cp  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
our deposits are fixed rate  but at short terms 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates in certain of our fixed rate loans and investments 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes in these assets by engaging in hedging activities as discussed below 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the estimated changes in net interest income for a twelve month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to the combined portfolios of our segments as of december   were as follows in thousands rate change basis points for the purpose of the above analysis  we included loans  investment securities  borrowings  deposits and derivatives 
loans  investment securities and deposits are assumed to be replaced as they run off 
the new loans  investment securities and deposits are assumed to have interest rates that reflect our forecast of prevailing market terms 
we also assumed that libor and prime rates do not fall below for loans and borrowings

we also enter into additional basis swap agreements to hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these basis swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting prime rate loans to one month libor 
our interest rate hedging activities partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under fixed rate and prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we also use interest rate swaps to hedge the interest rate risk of certain fixed rate debt 
these interest rate swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting fixed rate debt to one month libor 

table of contents we have also entered into relatively short dated forward exchange agreements to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency denominated loans 
for additional information  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  critical accounting estimates accounting policies are integral to understanding our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of the audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions based on information that is available at the time of the financial statements in determining accounting estimates used in the preparation of such statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and our critical accounting estimates are described in this section 
accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires management to make assumptions and judgments about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period  or if changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have established detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the assumptions and judgments surrounding these areas are adequately controlled  independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure related to these estimates 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
management performs detailed reviews of the portfolio quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan and lease losses 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan and lease losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan and lease losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the loan portfolio includes balances with non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually  and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
loans are then segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
higher risk loans are individually analyzed for impairment 
management establishes specific allowances for loans determined to be individually impaired 
all impaired loans are valued to determine if a specific allowance is warranted 
the valuation analysis for the specific allowance is based upon one of the three valuation methods i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s initially contracted effective yield  ii the loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral 
the appropriate valuation methodology generally reflects the chosen loan resolution strategy being pursued to maximize the recovery of the loan 
estimated costs to sell are considered in the impairment valuation when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan 
any guarantees provided by the borrower are typically not considered when determining our potential for specific loss 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation of inherent losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions and performance trends and any other pertinent information within specific portfolio segments 

table of contents as set forth in detail below  the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan and lease losses and  therefore  net income 
within this process  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  and iv adjustments made to assess certain factors  including overall credit and economic conditions 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we assign reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation are determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  land  commercial real estate  healthcare receivables or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  borrower industry  the relative seniority of our security interest  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal risk rating assigned to the loans 
we update these reserve factors periodically to capture actual and recent behavioral characteristics of the portfolios 
we estimate the allowance by applying historical loss factors derived from loss tracking mechanisms associated with actual portfolio activity over a specified period of time 
these estimates are adjusted when necessary based on additional analysis of long term average loss experience  external loan loss data and other risks identified from current and expected credit market conditions and trends  including management s judgment for estimated inaccuracy and uncertainty 
we also consider the need for qualitative factors which we use to provide for uncertainties surrounding our estimation process including changes in the volume of our problem loans  changes in the value of collateral for our collateral dependent loans  and the existence of certain loan concentrations 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan and lease losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of percentage applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   was as follows change in reserve factors estimated increase decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
the process of determining the level of allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of judgment 
if our internal risk ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan and lease losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan and lease losses 

table of contents we also consider whether losses might be incurred in connection with unfunded commitments to lend although  in making this assessment  we exclude from consideration those commitments for which funding is subject to our approval based on the adequacy of underlying collateral that is required to be presented by a borrower or other terms and conditions 
any such allowance for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in accordance with gaap  we prioritize the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this hierarchy  consisting of three levels of inputs  prioritizes observable data from active markets and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities that are actively traded in the marketplace or that have values based on readily available market value data require little  if any  subjectivity to be applied when determining the fair value 
these are classified as either level or level whether an asset or liability is classified as level or level depends largely on its similarity with other items in the marketplace and our ability to obtain corroborative data regarding whether the market in which the instrument trades is active 
fair value measurements on assets and liabilities that are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall measurement are classified as level as of december   and of total assets and total liabilities  respectively  were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
of these assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis  million of total assets were classified as level  billion of total assets were classified as level and million of total assets were classified as level as of december  from a liability perspective  million of total liabilities were classified as level as of december  as of december   no liabilities were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable market based inputs  when appropriate  to value our assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis or to determine whether an adjustment to fair value is needed for assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a non recurring basis 
given the nature of some of our assets carried at fair value  whether on a recurring or nonrecurring basis  clearly determinable market based valuation inputs are often not available 
therefore  the fair value measurements of these instruments utilize unobservable inputs and are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
we may be required to apply significant judgments in determining our fair value estimates for these assets 
due to the unavailability of observable inputs for our level assets  management assumptions used in the valuation models play a significant role in these fair value estimates 
in times of severe market volatility and illiquidity  there may be more uncertainty and variability with lack of market data to use in the valuation process 
an illiquid market is one in which little or no observable activity has occurred or one that lacks willing buyers 
to factor in market illiquidity  management makes adjustments to certain inputs in the valuation models and makes other assumptions to ensure fair values are reasonable and reflect current market conditions 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measurement 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  management s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
for additional information  see note  fair value measurements  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the estimates of fair values reflect our best judgments regarding the appropriate valuation methods and assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  
table of contents the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
due to the lack of observability of significant inputs  we must make assumptions in deriving our valuation inputs based on relevant empirical data surrounding interest rates  asset prices  timing of future cash flows and credit performance 
in addition  assumptions must be made to reflect constraints on liquidity  counterparty credit quality and other unobservable factors 
imprecision surrounding our assumptions related to unobservable market inputs may impact the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
furthermore  use of different methods to derive the fair value of our assets and liabilities could result in different fair value estimates at the measurement date 
we record fair value adjustments on our loans held for investment when we have determined that it is necessary to record a specific reserve against the loans  and we measure impairment using the fair value of the loan collateral 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to our loans held for investment measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these losses were attributable to an increased number of loans requiring a specific reserve during the year  as well as declines in the fair value of collateral for these loans 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  its states and municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when  in the future  certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign
