item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components  modules and systems for the commercial  automotive  agricultural and off highway vehicle markets 
on december   we completed the acquisition of an additional controlling interest in pst eletronica ltda 
pst 
as a result of the acquisition  we own of the outstanding equity of pst  which is a brazil based electronics system provider focused on security  convenience and infotainment devices and services  primarily for the automotive and motorcycle markets 
in exchange for the controlling interest in pst  we agreed to pay the sellers million in cash and issued million company common shares 
prior to the acquisition of the controlling interest  see note  pst was an unconsolidated joint venture accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
subsequent to the acquisition  pst is a consolidated subsidiary 
because pst was acquired on december   pst s results of operations were not consolidated in the company s statement of operations for the year ended december  we have preliminarily allocated the pst purchase price to net tangible assets acquired  intangible assets  goodwill and noncontrolling interest of million  million  million and million  respectively  as of the acquisition date 
these amounts were included on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  within the pst reportable segment 
during the year ended december   we recognized a one time non cash pre tax gain of million and an after tax gain of million as a result of remeasuring the previously held equity interest in pst to fair value 
for the year ended december   net sales were million  an increase of million over our net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the increase in our net sales was primarily a result of the significant production volume increases experienced in our served markets during  along with the contribution of net new business awards 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  for the after tax gain as a result of the pst acquisition discussed in the prior paragraph contributed to our per diluted share net income 
our results were positively affected by improvements in the north american and european commercial vehicle markets 
production volumes in the north american automotive vehicle market increased by during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the commercial vehicle market production volumes in north america improved by during the year ended december  when compared to the prior year  which resulted in increased net sales of approximately million  primarily within our electronics segment 
our net sales were also favorably affected by increased european commercial vehicle production volumes of during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this increased production volume had a positive effect on our net sales of approximately million  principally within the electronics segment 
our net sales were further favorably affected by approximately million  primarily within the electronics segment due to production volume increases within the agricultural vehicle market 
the automotive vehicle market production volume increase had a positive effect on our north american automotive vehicle market net sales of approximately million  primarily within our control devices segment 
overall net sales were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rates  primarily at our european electronics operation  of approximately million during the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  offsetting positive revenue volume gains and negatively affecting our gross margin were significant fluctuations in certain foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices  primarily the mexican peso and copper 
the fluctuations in these foreign exchange rates and commodity prices negatively impacted our results by approximately million and million  respectively  during the current year 
also  negatively affecting our current year results were operating inefficiencies experienced in our north american wiring locations within our electronics segment which required us to add headcount and incur overtime and premium freight costs 
as a result  our gross margin percentage decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we are executing plans including reducing direct labor headcount and overtime and developing more efficient manufacturing processes to address these operating inefficiencies 
these actions have reduced  and we expect them to continue to reduce  these types of costs 
effective january   we elected to change our method of valuing inventories for certain us businesses to the first in  first out fifo method  while in prior years  these inventories were valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
as a result of this change  all inventories are valued using the fifo method 
we believe the change is preferable as it conforms the inventory costing methods for all of our inventories to a single method and improves comparability with our industry peers 
the fifo method also better reflects current acquisition cost of those inventories on our consolidated balance sheets 
all prior periods presented herein have been adjusted to apply the new method retrospectively and conform to the current costing methodology 
for the years ended december  and  the effect of the change on our inventory costing method was a decrease in net income of million and an increase of million  respectively  after the change in accounting principle was applied to prior periods 
our selling  general and administrative sg a increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase in sg a was largely due to the non cash goodwill impairment charge of million related to bolton conductive sytems  llc bcs and increased incentive compensation expenses due to the achievement of eps targets resulting from the gain recognized on our previously held equity interest in pst 
in addition  we recognized of acquisition related costs during the year ended december  related to the pst acquisition 
our sg a costs decreased as a percentage of net sales because of the increase in net sales recognized in the current year when compared to the prior year 
our results for the year ended december  were also favorably affected by the wind down of our wholly owned subsidiary  stoneridge pollak limited spl  located in mitcheldean  united kingdom 
on february   we placed spl into administration a structured bankruptcy in the united kingdom 
we had previously ceased spl s manufacturing operations in december  as part of the restructuring initiatives announced in october the remaining assets and customer contracts of spl were transferred to our other subsidiaries subsequent to spl filing for administration 
we recognized a net gain within other expense income  net of approximately million  primarily from the reversal of the cumulative translation adjustment account  which had previously been included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
in addition  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  primarily employee benefit related which were also previously included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december  and  we maintained a cash and cash equivalents balance of million and million  respectively 
our cash balance at december  included million which was used to pay for a portion of the acquisition of the additional interest in pst on january  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding on our asset based credit facility the credit facility 
at december  and  we had undrawn borrowing capacity of million and million  respectively 
outlook the north american automotive vehicle market has recovered significantly from recent levels  which has had a favorable effect on our control devices segment s results 
north american automotive vehicle production was million units for for  this production volume is forecasted to be in the range of million to million units 
if this forecasted increase in production volume occurs  it will favorably affect our control devices segment 
the north american commercial vehicle market is expected to continue to increase through if this forecasted increase in production volume occurs  it will favorably affect our electronics segment 
the european commercial vehicle market is expected to decline in if this forecasted decrease in production volumes occurs  it will negatively affect our european electronics segment 
agricultural vehicle production increased in when compared to  which favorably affected both our electronics and control devices segments 
we believe that this market will continue to improve during our pst segment revenues are expected to be in the range of million to million in our results could be unfavorably affected by increased commodity prices  specifically copper 
copper prices increased during and have continued to fluctuate in we entered into fixed price commodity contracts for a portion of our copper purchases 
in addition  a portion of our sales will be subject to copper surcharge billings to our customers that will mitigate this increase in raw material costs 
our results could also be negatively affected by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates 
we have significant foreign denominated transaction exposure in certain locations  especially in mexico  sweden and brazil 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce exposure related to the mexican peso 
results of operations we are primarily organized by markets served and products produced 
under this structure  our operations have been organized into three reportable segments electronics  control devices and pst 
the electronics reportable segment includes results of operations that design and manufacture electronic instrument clusters  electronic control units  driver information systems and electrical distribution systems  primarily wiring harnesses and connectors for electrical power and signal distribution

although we benefited from increased sales during when compared to  our increase in cost of goods sold outpaced our increase in net sales on a percentage basis 
the primary drivers of the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales are certain unfavorable foreign exchange rates  higher commodity prices and operating inefficiencies  within our north american wiring locations in our electronics segment 
the unfavorable movement in the mexican peso compared to the us dollar negatively affected our gross margin 
this negative foreign currency exposure has increased our cost of goods sold by approximately million during the year ended december  commodity prices  principally copper  have fluctuated significantly from the prior year  which had a negative impact of approximately million during the year ended december  our gross margin percentage was further negatively impacted by the increase in volume in  resulting in higher copper purchases as the increase in copper prices outpaced our increase in net sales 
also  during the year ended december  we experienced operating inefficiencies  primarily in the form of unfavorable labor variances and premium freight charges in order to meet customer demands 
labor inefficiencies overtime and additional headcount at our north american wiring facilities negatively affected our results by approximately million 
premium freight charges between the periods presented increased by approximately million 
we are executing plans to address these inefficiencies including reducing direct labor headcount and overtime and developing more efficient manufacturing processes 
we have reduced  and expect to continue to reduce  these types of costs 
our material cost as a percentage of net sales for our electronics segment for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
this increase is largely due to copper volatility during our materials cost as a percentage of sales for the control devices segment increased from for to for the year ended december  the increase in direct materials as a percentage of net sales for the control devices segment is primarily a result of higher commodity prices incurred  principally precious metals  rare earth magnets and resins  during selling  general and administrative

in  we received proceeds of million from the sale of our former sarasota facility 
in addition  we disbursed million  net of cash acquired  in conjunction with the acquisition of a controlling interest in pst 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to cash received from borrowings on the asset based credit facility the credit facility  the bcs master revolving note the revolver  the term loan made to our subsidiary located in suzhou  china suzhou and the term loans related to pst 
the million borrowing under the credit facility was used to fund our purchase of an additional interest in pst and to fund our working capital requirements as a result of increased sales 
we believe that the cash provided by operating activities in will be sufficient to pay off the outstanding balance on the credit facility in summary of cash flows for the years ended december  and in thousands dollar increase decrease net cash provided by used for operating activities   investing activities   financing activities   effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents  net change in cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities for was consistent with our cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was positively affected by higher net income and accounts payable balances 
this was partially offset by higher accounts receivable and inventory balances 
our higher working capital account balances at december  were attributable to the higher sales volume in the current period 
our receivable terms and collections rates have remained consistent between periods presented 
as our served markets improve we expect that our working capital requirements will continue to increase accordingly 
the increase in net cash used for investing activities reflects an increase in cash used for capital projects of approximately million 
our capital expenditures were historically lower than normal as a result of our customers delaying product launches 
as our served markets continue to improve we expect our future capital expenditures to increase and be more consistent with our historical expenditures 
also  during  we acquired ownership interest in bcs at a cost of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we issued million senior secured notes with a fixed interest rate of 
these senior secured notes were issued at a discount to the initial purchasers  which resulted in net proceeds of million from the issuance 
we used the proceeds from this issuance and cash on hand to extinguish our million  senior notes 
we refinanced this long term liability in order to extend its maturity to october  and to reduce the interest rate on the debt 
in conjunction with the senior secured notes issuance  we incurred million of costs  which were capitalized as deferred financing costs at december  as a result of the refinancing  we reduced our annual cash interest by approximately million 
also  during  our wholly owned subsidiary located in suzhou  china suzhou entered into a term loan of  chinese yuan which was approximately million at december the following table summarizes our future cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments  as of december  in thousands less than after total year years years years debt      operating leases     total contractual obligations    management will continue to focus on reducing its weighted average cost of capital and believes that cash flows from operations and the availability of funds from our credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our future growth and operating needs 
on october   we issued million of senior secured notes 
these senior secured notes bear interest at an annual rate of and mature on october  the senior secured notes were issued at a discount to the initial purchasers 
we accrete this discount using the effective interest method over the life of the senior secured notes 
the senior secured notes are redeemable  at our option  beginning october  at 
interest payments commenced on april  and are payable on april and october of each year 
the senior secured notes indenture limits our and our restricted subsidiaries amount of indebtedness  restricts certain payments and includes various other non financial restrictive covenants 
the senior secured notes are guaranteed by all of our existing domestic restricted subsidiaries 
all other restricted subsidiaries that guarantee any of our or our guarantors indebtedness will also guarantee the senior secured notes 
on october   we entered into a fixed to variable interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million 
the swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed interest rate obligation under our million senior secured notes due october  we pay variable interest equal to the six month libor plus and we receive a fixed interest rate of under the swap 
the critical terms of the swap match the terms of the senior secured notes  including maturity of october   resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness 
in connection with the senior secured notes issuance  we entered into an amended and restated credit and security agreement the amended and restated agreement on september  the amended and restated agreement which became effective on october  i provided certain consents necessary for the issuance of the senior secured notes  ii extended the expiration date of the credit facility to november  and iii granted the facility agent  for the benefit of the lenders  second priority liens and security interests in the collateral subject to first priority liens and security interests in favor of the collateral agent for the holders of the senior secured notes 
in addition  on december   we entered into a second amended and restated credit and security agreement the second amended and restated agreement 
the second amended and restated agreement extended the termination date of the credit facility to december  approximately a four year extension  increased the borrowing base by increasing the sublimit on eligible inventory located at mexican facilities and made changes to certain covenants relating to  among other things  guarantees  investments  capital expenditures and permitted indebtedness 
as outlined in note to our consolidated financial statements  our credit facility permits borrowing up to a maximum level of million 
at december   we had million in borrowings outstanding on the credit facility 
the available borrowing capacity on the credit facility is based on eligible current assets  as defined 
at december   we had undrawn borrowing capacity of million based on eligible current assets 
the credit facility does not contain financial performance covenants which would constrain our borrowing capacity 
however  restrictions do include limits on capital expenditures  operating leases  dividends and investment activities in a negative covenant which limits investment activities to million minus certain guarantees and obligations 
the company received a waiver and amendment to extend the delivery of certain documents required for the company s acquisition of an additional interest in pst 
other than this waiver  the company was in compliance with all covenants at december  and december  the bcs master revolving note the revolver permits borrowing up to a maximum level of million 
on september   bcs amended the revolver to extend the maturity date to september  and maintained the interest rate at the prime referenced rate plus a margin of  which is payable quarterly 
the available borrowing capacity on the revolver is based on an advanced formula  as defined 
at december   bcs had no borrowing capacity based on the advanced formula 
at december   bcs had approximately million in borrowings outstanding on the revolver  which is included on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of short term borrowings 
at december  the interest rate on the revolver was 
the company is a guarantor as it relates to the revolver 
the revolver contains certain financial restrictive covenants 
bcs violated the fixed charge and tangible net worth covenants related to the revolver during the first quarter of bcs has received a waiver for covenant violations occurring during this period 
during the first quarter of  the fixed charge and tangible net worth covenants were eliminated from the revolver through its expiration 
the company s consolidated subsidiary  pst  maintains several revolving credit facilities with brazilian financial institutions  providing an aggregate borrowing capacity up to million 
the revolving credit facilities expire throughout at december   there were borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facilities 
pst also maintains several term loans used for working capital purposes 
at december   there was million in borrowings outstanding on the loans 
of the outstanding borrowings  million is to be paid in and is included on the december  consolidated balance sheet as a component of current portion of long term debt 
the balance of million is included on the december  consolidated balance sheet as a component of long term debt 
the million is comprised of million that matures in  with the balance maturing in depending on the specific loan  interest is payable either monthly or annually based on rates ranging from to 
at december   all covenants of the loan agreements were being met 
the suzhou term loan is in the amount of million chinese yuan  which was approximately million at december  the term loan matures on september  interest is payable monthly at the one year lending rate published by the people s bank of china multiplied by 
at december   the interest rate on the term loan was 
as part of our acquisition of bcs  we may be required to make additional payments to the previous owners of bcs for the membership interest we purchased based on bcs achieving financial performance targets as defined by the purchase agreement 
the maximum amount of additional payments to the prior owners of bcs is million in and is contingent upon bcs achieving profitability targets based on earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization in we did not record an amount related to the fair value of the estimated future additional payments to the prior owners of bcs as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the purchase agreement provides us with the option to purchase the remaining interest in bcs in at a price determined in accordance with the purchase agreement 
if we do not exercise this option the minority owners of bcs have the option in to purchase our interest in bcs at a price determined in accordance with the purchase agreement or to jointly market bcs for sale 
we have significant us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and research credit carryforwards 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes an annual limitation on the ability of a corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use its net operating loss and credit carryforwards to reduce its tax liability 
during the fourth quarter of we undertook a secondary offering 
as a result of the secondary offering a substantial change in our ownership occurred and we experienced an ownership change pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
there was no impact to the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations as of december  and due to us being in a full valuation allowance position with respect to our federal deferred tax assets 
at december   we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of approximately million  of which million was held domestically and million was held in foreign locations 
our cash balance was not restricted at december  inflation and international presence given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity prices  we believe that an increase in such items could significantly affect our profitability 
furthermore  by operating internationally  we are affected by foreign currency exchange rates and the economic conditions of certain countries 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates and assumptions used in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies those most important to the financial presentation and those that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
revenue recognition and sales commitments 
we recognize revenues from the sale of products  net of actual and estimated returns of products sold based on historical authorized returns  at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
we often enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given vehicle s expected production life 
once such agreements are entered into  it is our obligation to fulfill the customers purchasing requirements for the entire production life of the vehicle 
these agreements are subject to renegotiation  which may affect product pricing 
in certain limited instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply products to our customers at selling prices which are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
in such situations  we recognize losses immediately 
there were no such significant instances of this in these agreements generally may also be terminated by our customers at any time 
on an ongoing basis  we receive blanket purchase orders from our customers  which include pricing terms 
purchase orders do not always specify quantities 
we recognize revenue based on the pricing terms included in our purchase orders as our products are shipped to our customers 
we are asked to provide our customers with annual cost reductions as part of certain agreements 
in addition  we have ongoing adjustments to our pricing arrangements with our customers based on the related content  the cost of our products and other commercial factors 
such pricing adjustments are recognized as they are negotiated with our customers 
warranties 
our warranty reserve is established based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet dates 
this estimate is based on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims 
to estimate the warranty reserve  we are required to forecast the resolution of existing claims as well as expected future claims on products previously sold 
although we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our customers are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which could negatively impact our exposure to these costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have concentrations of sales and trade receivable balances with a few key customers 
therefore  it is critical that we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet their financial obligations  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
additionally  we review historical trends for collectability in determining an estimate for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if economic circumstances change substantially  estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
we do not have collateral requirements with our customers 
contingencies 
we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including product liability claims  commercial or contractual disputes  environmental enforcement actions and other claims that arise in the normal course of business 
we routinely assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as ranges of probable losses  by consulting with internal personnel principally involved with such matters and with our outside legal counsel handling such matters 
we have accrued for estimated losses when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating that amount of probable loss 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
effective january   the company elected to change its costing method to the fifo method for all inventories 
the company adopted this change in accounting principle by retrospectively adjusting all prior periods presented 
where appropriate  standard cost systems are utilized for purposes of determining cost and the standards are adjusted as necessary to approximate actual costs 
estimates of the lower of cost or market value of inventory are determined based upon current economic conditions  historical sales quantities and patterns and  in some cases  the specific risk of loss on specifically identified inventories 
we adjust our excess and obsolescence reserve at least on a quarterly basis 
excess inventories are quantities of items that exceed anticipated sales or usage for a reasonable period 
we have guidelines for calculating provisions for excess inventories based on the number of months of inventories on hand compared to anticipated sales or usage 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the valuation methodologies employed by the company use subjective measures including forward looking financial information and discount rates that directly impact the resulting fair values used to test the company s business units for impairment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our application of this accounting standard  including the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of goodwill 
share based compensation 
the estimate for our share based compensation expense involves a number of assumptions 
we believe each assumption used in the valuation is reasonable because it takes into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations 
we estimate volatility and forfeitures based on historical data  future expectations and the expected term of the share based compensation awards 
the assumptions  however  involve inherent uncertainties 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense could have varied 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and regulations 
our deferred tax assets include  among other items  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods 
these deferred tax assets begin to expire  if unused  by december  and  respectively 
accounting standards require that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
this assessment requires significant judgment  and in making this evaluation  the company considers available positive and negative evidence  including past results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent periods  our forecast of taxable income for the current year and future years and tax planning strategies 
risk factors include the continuing deterioration in economic conditions in the us automotive and commercial vehicle segments of which the company has significant us operations and higher than planned volume or price reductions from key customers 
during the fourth quarter of  the company concluded that it was no longer more likely than not that we would realize our us deferred tax assets 
as a result we provided a full valuation allowance  net of certain future reversing taxable temporary differences  with respect to our us deferred tax assets 
this conclusion has not changed through to the extent that realization of a portion or all of the tax assets becomes more likely than not to be realized based on changes in circumstances a reversal of that portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be recorded 
the company does not provide deferred income taxes on unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries  which are deemed permanently reinvested 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
restructuring 
we have recorded restructuring charges in prior periods in connection with improving manufacturing efficiency and cost position by transferring production to other locations 
these charges are recorded when management has committed to a plan and incurred a liability related to the plan 
also in connection with this initiative  we recorded liabilities for severance costs 
no fixed asset impairment charges were incurred because assets are primarily being transferred to our other locations for continued production 
estimates for work force reductions and other costs savings are recorded based upon estimates of the number of positions to be terminated  termination benefits to be provided and other information as necessary 
management evaluates the estimates on a quarterly basis and will adjust the reserve when information indicates that the estimate is above or below the initial estimate 
for further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
recently issued accounting standards new accounting standards to be implemented in may  the fasb issued changes to fair value measurement 
this change clarifies the concepts related to highest and best use and valuation premise  blockage factors and other premiums and discounts  the fair value measurement of financial instruments held in a portfolio and of those instruments classified as a component of shareowners equity 
the guidance includes enhanced disclosure requirements about recurring level fair value measurements  the use of nonfinancial assets  and the level in the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities not recorded at fair value 
the provisions are effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  early application is prohibited 
this requires changes in presentation only and we do not expect it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income 
these changes give an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements  the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders equity was eliminated 
the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income were not changed 
additionally  no changes were made to the calculation and presentation of earnings per share 
these changes become effective for the company on january  management is currently evaluating these changes to determine which option will be chosen for the presentation of comprehensive income 
other than the change in presentation  management has determined these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued changes to the testing of goodwill for impairment 
these changes provide an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
such qualitative factors may include the following macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall financial performance  and other relevant entity specific events 
if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not  the entity is then required to perform the existing two step quantitative impairment test  otherwise no further analysis is required 
an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and  instead  go directly to the two step quantitative impairment test 
these changes become effective for the company for any goodwill impairment test performed on january  or later  although early adoption is permitted 
management performs a review of the company s goodwill in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
we do not expect that adoption of these provisions will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated guidance to provide enhanced disclosures such that users of the financial statements will be able to better evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on the statement of financial position 
the guidance requires improved information about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are either offset according to specific guidance or subject to an enforceable master netting agreement or similar arrangement 
the disclosures will provide both net and gross information for these assets and liabilities 
although we do not currently elect to offset assets and liabilities within the scope of the guidance  expanded disclosures will be required starting for the quarter ended march   along with retrospective presentation of prior periods

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk from time to time  we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily resulting from the effects of changes in interest rates 
the face amount of our senior secured notes was million at december  we currently have million outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap agreement the swap with a notional amount of million to hedge our exposure to fair value fluctuations on a portion of our senior secured notes 
the swap was designated as a fair value hedge of the fixed interest rate obligation under our million senior secured notes due october  under the swap  we pay a variable interest rate equal to the six month london interbank offered rate libor plus and we receive a fixed interest rate of 
the swap requires semi annual settlements on april and october  which began on april  the critical terms of the swap are aligned with the terms of the senior secured notes  including maturity of october   resulting in no hedge ineffectiveness 
a hypothetical favorable or adverse change in the libor would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
commodity price risk given the current economic climate and recent fluctuations in certain commodity costs  we currently are experiencing an increased risk  particularly with respect to the purchase of copper  zinc  resins and certain other commodities 
in the past  we managed this risk through a combination of fixed price agreements  staggered short term contract maturities and commercial negotiations with our suppliers 
in the future if we believe that the terms of a fixed price agreement become beneficial to us  we will enter into another such instrument 
we have sought to alleviate the impact of increasing costs by including a material pass through provision in our customer contracts whenever possible 
we may also consider pursuing alternative commodities or alternative suppliers to mitigate this risk over a period of time 
the recent volatility in certain commodity costs has negatively affected our operating results 
during  we entered into several fixed price swap contracts for a total of million pounds of copper 
a portion of these contracts lasted through december  and the remaining contracts cover january to december the purpose of these contracts is to reduce our price risk as it relates to copper prices 
we estimate that a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in the fair value of commodity prices would be approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange risk we use derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by reducing the effect of such fluctuations on foreign currency denominated intercompany transactions and other foreign currency exposures 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts that had a notional value of million as of december  the purpose of these foreign currency contracts is to reduce exposure related to the company s euro and swedish krona denominated receivables as well as to reduce exposure to future mexican peso denominated purchases 
the estimated fair value of these contracts at december   per quoted market sources  was approximately million 
these foreign currency option contracts expire during we do not expect the effects of this risk to be material in the future based on the current operating and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate 
a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for our euro and swedish krona denominated receivables  as of december  a hypothetical pre tax gain loss in fair value from favorable or adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million or million for the company s mexican peso denominated payables as of december  it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
therefore  a hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a favorable or adverse change in quoted foreign currencies would not significantly affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
we have significant operations in foreign locations 
as a result we are subject to the risk of price fluctuations due to the effects of exchange rates on net sales  operating costs  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly the mexican peso  euro  swedish krona and british pound 
we estimate that a hypothetical favorable or adverse change of the us dollar relative to other currencies in would have a pre tax translation favorable unfavorable effect of million or million as of december
