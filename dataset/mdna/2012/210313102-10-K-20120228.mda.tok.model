we opened and staffed our united kingdom office during the third quarter of  marking our first direct expansion outside of north america 
we will continue to increase our international resources and plan to establish a market leadership position internationally as we have done domestically 
constant contact event marketing surpassed  paying customers in in the second quarter of  we continued our investment in innovation  launching a number of new tools such as the social media quickstarter  a completely free step by step guide that offers short tutorials for getting up and running and improving success with the most popular social media networks  and simple share  which gives small businesses and non profits the opportunity to share more of their content by creating it once and then spreading it across social networks simply  easily and effectively

bantam networks provides us with a social crm platform and technology that will serve as the foundation for all of our solutions  plus an experienced and talented team focused on developing products for small businesses 
key financial and operating metrics in connection with the ongoing operation of our business  our management regularly reviews key financial and operating metrics 
given our growth strategy  we pay particular attention to customer life time value  customer acquisition metrics  number of products per customer and average revenue per customer 
we also consider other operating metrics such as revenue  gross margin  expenses  cost of acquisition  trialer growth  conversion rates for our website visitors and our trialers  customer attrition  customer satisfaction rates  success in cross selling and growing customer list sizes  average speed of answer for customer support calls  email deliverability rates and capital expenditures  among others 
management considers these financial and operating metrics critical to understanding and improving our business  reviewing our historical performance  benchmarking our performance versus other companies and identifying current and future trends  and for planning purposes 

table of contents in addition  we consider the following non gaap financial measures to be key indicators of our financial performance adjusted ebitda  which we define as gaap net income loss plus depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  and adjusted for interest and other income expense and income taxes  adjusted ebitda margin  which we define as adjusted ebitda divided by revenue  non gaap net income  which we define as gaap net income loss plus stock based compensation and adjusted for the non cash portion of income taxes  and free cash flow  which we define as net cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations 
these non gaap financial measures  however  are not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap and should not be considered a substitute for gaap financial measures  including but not limited to net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
the summary should be considered along with the factors set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we continue to closely monitor current economic conditions both in the us and abroad  particularly as they impact small businesses  associations and non profits 
we believe that small organizations continue to experience some amount of economic hardship 
if this economic hardship continues or worsens  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
our long term strategy is substantially dependent on our ability to continue to generate interest in our existing products and to expand our product offerings to serve the online marketing needs of small businesses  associations and non profits 
if we fail to do either of these  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
we believe that given the size of our potential market and the relatively low barriers to entry  competition will continue to increase 
increased competition could result from existing competitors or new competitors that enter the market because of the potential opportunity 
we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity and respond accordingly 
increased competition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that as we continue to grow revenue at expected rates  our cost of revenue and operating expenses  including sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
for a description of the general trends we anticipate in various expense categories  see cost of revenue and operating expenses below 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the 
table of contents accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
accordingly  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
see also note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we provide access to our products through subscription arrangements whereby the customer is charged a fee for access for a defined term 
subscription arrangements include access to use our software via the internet and support services  such as telephone support 
when there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed reasonably assured  we recognize revenue on a daily basis over the subscription period as the services are delivered 
we also offer ancillary services to our customers related to our products such as custom services and training through our experts program 
custom services and training revenue is accounted for separate from subscription revenue as those services have value on a standalone basis  do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria and as the fair value of our subscription services is evidenced by their availability on a standalone basis 
custom services and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of income taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes related to timing differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements by applying a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when consideration paid in a purchase acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and the identified intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
we perform our assessment for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and we have determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting this annual goodwill impairment assessment 
for purposes of assessing potential impairment  we annually estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization and compare this amount to the carrying value of the reporting unit as reflected by our total stockholders equity 
if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge would be required 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill on november  based upon that evaluation  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as the pattern of consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible assets cannot be reliably determined  we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis 
software and website development costs 
relative to development costs of our on demand products and website  we capitalize certain direct costs to develop functionality as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are probable to result in additional functionality 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development 
table of contents are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized as part of property and equipment until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
once placed in use  capitalized software is amortized over a three year period in the expense category to which the software relates 
stock based compensation 
we value all stock based compensation  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  at fair value on the date of grant  and expense the fair value over the applicable service period 
the straight line method is applied to all awards with service conditions  while the graded vesting method is applied to all awards with both service and performance conditions 
we base the fair value of common stock on the quoted market price of our stock 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair value of common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method for estimating the expected term for awards that qualify as plain vanilla options 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the publicly traded stocks of a peer group of companies  inclusive of us  commencing october the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to us treasury bond yields at or near the time of grant for time periods similar to the expected term of the award 
the relevant data used to determine the value of the stock option grants is as follows years ended december  weighted average risk free interest rate expected term in years weighted average expected volatility expected dividends these assumptions represented our best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
authoritative guidance requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for awards with service conditions 
for awards with performance conditions we estimate the probability that the performance condition will be met 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from our customers 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying customers and the subscription fees for our products and is not concentrated within any one customer or group of customers 
in  our top customers accounted for less than of our total revenue 
we do not require our customers to commit to a contractual term  however  our customers are required to prepay for subscriptions on a monthly  semi annual  or annual basis by providing a credit card or bank check 
fees are recorded initially as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a daily basis over the prepaid subscription period 
we also generate a small amount of revenue from ancillary services related to our products  which primarily consist of custom services and training through our experts program 
revenue generated from professional services and training accounted for approximately of gross revenue for each of the years ended december   and 
table of contents cost of revenue and operating expenses we allocate certain occupancy and general office related expenses  such as rent  utilities  office supplies and depreciation of general office assets to cost of revenue and operating expense categories based on headcount 
as a result  an occupancy expense allocation is reflected as personnel related costs in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of wages and benefits for software operations and customer support personnel  credit card processing fees and depreciation and amortization  maintenance and hosting of our software applications underlying our product offerings 
we allocate a portion of customer support costs relating to assisting trial customers to sales and marketing expense 
the expenses related to our hosted software applications are affected by the number of customers who subscribe to our products and the complexity and redundancy of our software applications and hosting infrastructure 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase our number of customers but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time as we gain efficiencies created by our expected revenue growth and cost savings 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for product strategy and development personnel 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving ease of use  functionality and technological scalability of our existing products as well as on the development of new product offerings 
we primarily expense research and development costs 
however  direct development costs related to software enhancements that add functionality are capitalized and amortized over their useful life 
we expect that on an annual basis research and development expenses will increase both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue due to our expanded investment in our product roadmap over the next twelve months 
over the longer term we expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional costs  wages and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  partner referral fees and the portion of customer support costs that relate to assisting trial customers 
advertising costs consist primarily of pay per click advertising with search engines  other online and offline advertising media  including television and radio advertisements  as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
promotional costs consist primarily of public relations  memberships and event costs 
in order to continue to grow our business and brand and category awareness  we expect that we will continue to commit substantial resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we expect that on an annual basis  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for administrative  human resources  internal information technology support  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees  board compensation and expenses  certain taxes and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the anticipated growth of our business and incur costs related to operating as a public company 
therefore  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decline slightly as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate

as of december   we provided a full valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets as we believed the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pre tax net losses outweighed the existing positive evidence regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
during  we reassessed the need for a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and concluded that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets primarily as a result of continued profitability and forecasted future results 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter of we released our valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets 
as a result of the release of our valuation allowance we expect our tax rate will increase in the future 
however  we intend to use our net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  to the extent available  to reduce the corporate income tax liability associated with our operations

table of contents in january  we acquired cardstar for a cash purchase price of million

in  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to of revenue  which will consist primarily of hardware and software purchases  capitalization of internal use software and furniture and leasehold improvements related to additional office space 
our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  development of new products  market acceptance of our products  the levels of advertising and promotion required to launch additional products and improve our competitive position in the marketplace  the expansion of our sales  support and marketing organizations  the establishment of additional offices in the united states and worldwide and the building of infrastructure necessary to support our anticipated growth  the response of competitors to our products and our relationships with suppliers and clients 
since the introduction of our on demand email marketing product in  we have experienced increases in our expenditures consistent with the growth in our operations and personnel  and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings to fund our operations  develop or enhance products  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders or we may be subject to covenants that restrict how we conduct our business 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
during the last three years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business 
we are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future

we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities 
new accounting guidance in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued new accounting guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income to provide companies with two options for presenting comprehensive income 
companies can present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  in december  the fasb indefinitely deferred the amendment s requirement to present reclassification adjustments of other comprehensive income by line item on the face of the income statement 
as the new guidance relates only to how comprehensive income is disclosed and does not change the items that must be reported as comprehensive income  adoption will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance that simplifies how companies test goodwill for impairment 
the amendment permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more 
table of contents likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test described in goodwill accounting standard 
the amendments are effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of the new guidance will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations we lease our headquarters under an operating lease that is effective through september with one five year extension option 
the lease includes the space we are occupying now as well as additional space that will be made available to us through the term of the lease 
we lease office space in colorado for a sales and support office under an operating lease that expires in april with three three year extension options 
we also lease small amounts of general office space in florida  new york  california and the united kingdom under lease agreements that expire at various dates through we have agreements with various vendors to provide specialized space and equipment and related services from which we host our software application 
the agreements include payment commitments that expire at various dates through early as of december   we had issued both cancellable and non cancellable purchase orders and entered into contractual commitments with various vendors totaling million 
this amount relates primarily to marketing programs and other non marketing related goods and services to be delivered over the next twelve months 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
total less than year years years more than years in thousands office lease obligations third party hosting agreements vendor commitments total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
significantly all of our revenue and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to material fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  as we increase our operations in international markets we will become increasingly exposed to changes in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements is often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december   which consisted of cash  government securities  corporate and agency bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  however  due to the nature of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates
