item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial trends during the fiscal year we delivered solid financial results reflected by an increase in net income and gross profit margins compared to fiscal year additionally  we continued to have a strong balance sheet  which reflects both improved liquidity and working capital compared to fiscal year for the near term  it appears that the united states economy will continue to be sluggish 
we believe these conditions will continue based on a variety of factors  including the fact that we are in an election year with constrained federal funding  the continued effects of high unemployment  the continuing weak european financial markets  and the existence of debt reduction pressures that will continue to put pressure on economic recovery 
in this challenging economic environment  we focus on those opportunities where funding is non discretionary for our customers such as sustainable range management  unexploded ordnance  performance based remediation  and construction contract management 
we will also continue to focus on areas that we believe offer attractive enough returns to our clients that they will continue to fund efforts  such as construction type services both in the united states and internationally  improvements in energy efficiency  and facility upgrades 
we have been investing heavily in business development activities designed to specifically tailor responses to a customer s value solution and sustainability needs 
we have invested in new internal technologies to streamline productivity and have realized benefits from continued cost reduction efforts concentrated on our fixed and controllable expenses 
during fiscal year  we reorganized our operations eliminating one business segment by reallocating its operations to two other existing business segments 
these changes resulted from an initiative designed to identify the best organizational structure to increase operating and business efficiencies and to streamline internal reporting authorities based on strategic alignment of our various operations 
we believe that versar s realigned business segments have the expertise to identify and respond to the challenges raised by the global economic issues we face and are positioned in the coming year to address these concerns 
our business now operates through the following three business segments engineering and construction management  environmental services  and professional services 
prior segment results have been recast to conform to the current presentation 
the engineering and construction management business segment remains our largest business 
these segments were segregated based on the nature of the work  business processes  and customer bases and the business environment in which each of the segments operates 
there are risk factors or uncertainties that could significantly impact our future financial performance 
a sample of these risks is listed below 
for a complete discussion of these risk factors and uncertainties refer to item a 
risk factors  herein 
we operate in highly competitive industries  a reduction or delay in pending by government agencies could adversely affect us  our inability to win or renew government contacts could adversely affect us  we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  our failure to properly manage projects may result in additional costs or claims  an economic downturn may adversely affect our business  in order to succeed we need to keep up with a variety of rapidly changing technologies  we are highly dependent on key personnel  future acquisitions may not go as expected and may have unexpected costs and consequences  the government may adopt new contract laws or regulations at any time

a summary of gross revenue generated from our client base is as follows for the years ended june  july  june  in thousands government dod    state local    epa    other    commercial    gross revenue   liquidity and capital resources our working capital as of june  was approximately million  an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  our current ratio at june  was compared to from the prior fiscal year 
as discussed in note m debt and note t subsequent event  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k  we have a line of credit facility with united bank 
on september  the line of credit facility was modified to extend its maturity date to september  and to make certain other changes to the terms and conditions governing the line for credit 
we cumulatively borrowed and repaid million and million under the line of credit during fiscal year and  respectively 
accordingly  we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit at june  and july  on october   we terminated our letter of credit of approximately million outstanding under the line of credit facility  which served as collateral for surety bond coverage provided by our insurance carrier against project construction work which had been completed 
we financed a portion of our fiscal year acquisition of charron through seller notes totaling million 
at june  the outstanding aggregate principal balance of the notes was million 
additionally  in fiscal year we financed a portion of the acquisitions of pps and advent through seller notes totaling approximately million 
at june  no amounts were outstanding under the pps and advent notes 
at july   the outstanding principal balances of the notes payable were approximately  and  for pps and advent  respectively 
we believe that in light of our cash balance of million at the end of fiscal year  along with anticipated cash flows from operations and availability under our extended line of credit  our working capital will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs within the next fiscal year 
expected capital requirements for fiscal year are approximately million  to be used primarily for annual hardware and software purchases to maintain our existing information technology systems  equipment related to our military munitions response programs  and upgrades to our personal protective equipment manufacturing 
these capital requirements will be funded through existing working capital 
contractual obligations at june   we had total contractual obligations of approximately million  including short term obligations of approximately million 
the short term obligations will become due over the next twelve months fiscal year 
our contractual obligations are primarily related to lease commitments 
additionally  we have principal and interest obligations related to the notes payable from our acquisition of charron 
the table below specifies the total contractual payment obligations as of june  contractual obligations total within year years years after years in thousands operating lease obligations    notes payable to sellers  estimated interest obligations total contractual obligations    critical accounting policies and related estimates that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial position and results of operations which require management judgments and estimates  or involve uncertainties 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
revenue recognition contracts in process are stated at the lower of actual costs incurred plus accrued profits or incurred costs reduced by progress billings 
on cost plus fee contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned  and on time and material contracts  revenue is recognized to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus material and other reimbursable costs incurred 
we record income from major fixed price contracts  extending over more than one accounting period  using the percentage of completion method 
during the performance of such contracts  estimated final contract prices and costs are periodically reviewed and revisions are made as required 
fixed price contracts can be significantly impacted by changes in contract performance  contract delays  liquidated damages and penalty provisions  and contract change orders  which may affect the revenue recognition on a project 
revisions to such estimates are made when they become known 
detailed quarterly project reviews are conducted with project managers to review all project progress accruals and revenue recognition 
there is the possibility that there will be future and currently unforeseeable adjustments to our estimated contract revenues  costs and margins for fixed price contracts  particularly in the later stages of these contracts 
such adjustments are common in the construction industry given the nature of the contracts 
these adjustments could either positively or negatively impact our estimates due to the circumstances surrounding the negotiations of change orders  the impact of schedule slippage  subcontractor claims and contract disputes which are normally resolved at the end of the contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts disputes arise in the normal course of our business on projects where we are contesting with customers for collection of funds because of events such as delays  changes in contract specifications and questions of cost allowability and collectibility 
such disputes  whether claims or unapproved change orders in process of negotiation  are recorded at the lesser of their estimated net realizable value or actual costs incurred and only when realization is probable and can be reliably estimated 
management reviews outstanding receivables on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for reserves  taking into consideration past collection history and other events that bear on the collectibility of such receivables 
all receivables over days old are reviewed as part of this process 
allowance for doubtful financing receivables the methodology for determining the allowance for doubtful financing receivables is based on the review of specific facts and circumstances of both the receivables and the respective borrowers  including the inherent risk of the borrowers being private closely held companies 
during its analysis of collectability  management assesses factors such as existing economic conditions of the borrower and the borrower s industries  each borrower s repayment history related to the notes  and other external factors that may impact the repayment of the notes receivable by the borrower 
a reserve against the financing receivable will be recorded when there is a specific risk of collectability 
a write off of a financing receivable will occur when it has been deemed uncollectable  based on management s judgment 
share based compensation share based compensation is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award 
the majority of the company s equity awards granted in fiscal years   and were restricted stock unit awards 
share based compensation cost for restricted stock unit awards is based on the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation cost for stock options is calculated on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options  as calculated using the black scholes pricing model 
net deferred tax asset we have approximately million in net deferred tax assets as of june  these deferred tax assets are comprised of tax benefits associated with accrued expenses  reserves and employee benefits and are offset against deferred tax liabilities related to depreciation and amortization 
we expect these net deferred tax assets to be fully utilized except for net operating loss carryforwards from our philippine branch in the amount of  for which  consistent with prior years  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
we review the cash flows of the operating units to ensure the carrying values do not exceed the cash flows that they support 
any write downs are treated as permanent reductions 
we believe our long lived assets as of june  are fully realizable 
goodwill the carrying value of goodwill at june  and july  was million and million  respectively 
the goodwill balances were principally generated from our fiscal year acquisition of charron and our acquisitions of pps and advent 
in performing the goodwill impairment analysis  management utilized a market based valuation approach 
management engaged outside professionals and valuation experts to assist in performing this annual review and will test more often if events and circumstances warrant it 
we have elected to perform the annual goodwill impairment assessment on the last day of each fiscal year 
as part of the impairment assessment  an analysis was performed on public companies and company transactions to prepare a market based valuation 
based upon the analysis  the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded the carrying value of the net assets as of june  accordingly  the goodwill impairment test for fiscal year concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired 
should the financial performance of the reporting units not meet estimates  then impairment of goodwill would have to be further assessed to determine whether a write down of goodwill value would be warranted 
if such a write down were to occur  it would negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
however  it would not impact our cash flow or financial debt covenants 
intangible assets the net carrying value of our intangible assets at june  and july  was and million  respectively 
the intangible assets include customer related assets  marketing related assets  and technology based assets 
these intangible assets are amortized over a year useful life 
we review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset might not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
any impairments of the asset are treated as permanent reductions 
we believe that our intangible assets were not impaired during fiscal years or asset retirement obligation we have recorded an asset retirement obligation associated with the estimated clean up costs for our chemical laboratory that resides in our engineering and construction management business segment 
this obligation represents the estimated costs to clean up the laboratory and return it to its original state 
if we determine that the estimated clean up cost is larger than expected any adjustments that are required will be recorded when they become known 
at june  and july   we have an asset retirement obligation balance of approximately million associated with the estimated clean up costs for our chemical laboratory

impact of inflation we protect ourselves from the effects of inflation 
the majority of contracts we perform are for a period of a year or less and are firm fixed price contracts 
multi year contracts provide for projected increases in labor and other costs
