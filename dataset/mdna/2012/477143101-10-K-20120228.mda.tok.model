item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an award winning airline with a differentiated product and a unique culture focused on our commitment to customer service 
we offer competitive fares primarily on point to point routes  operating a young  fuel efficient fleet of airbus a aircraft and embraer aircraft 
our core product offers customers the unique jetblue experience  which includes more legroom than any other domestic airline s main cabin  free in flight entertainment  pre assigned seating  unlimited snacks and the airline industry s only customer bill of rights  which provides for compensation to customers who experience avoidable inconveniences as well as some unavoidable circumstances and commits us to perform at high service standards and holds us accountable if we do not 
at december   we served destinations in states  puerto rico  mexico  and countries in the caribbean and latin america and operated over flights a day 
our goal is to become the americas favorite airline for our employees  whom we refer to as crewmembers  customers and shareholders 
we are committed to doing so by focusing on three main attributes  investing in our culture including our people  through our offerings including our fleet  product and network  and through foundations  including our processes and systems 
over the past year  we made improvements to our offerings 
most notably  we executed on our network strategy  by strategically growing in our key boston and caribbean markets 
we worked to reduce some of the seasonality in our network associated with our traditional leisure travel base by attracting more business travelers 
our focus on offerings resulted in a strong year of double digit increases in unit revenue with operating revenues per available seat mile for increasing over we strengthened our position as the largest carrier in boston by adding five new destinations from boston during we also invested in airport infrastructure changes in boston to enhance the customer experience with new systems and additional airport space 
we continued our focus on building our relevance to the business customer travelling to and from logan airport 
in the caribbean and latin america region  we continued to increase our presence and reached milestones in  by becoming the largest airline serving both puerto rico and the dominican republic 
in particular  our expansion in san juan  puerto rico included the introduction of intra island service to many of our caribbean destinations 
we have approximately of our capacity in the caribbean and latin america region 
we are focused on optimizing our schedule and balancing our network to serve a diversified customer mix of leisure travelers  business travelers and visiting friends and relatives  or vfr  traffic 
we continually seek to enhance our product and provide our customers with superior service 
in june  we re branded and expanded our popular even more legroom offering  now known as even more space  which includes extra legroom plus early boarding and early access to overhead bin space 
additionally  we introduced even more speed  which offers customers the option to enjoy an expedited security experience in select jetblue airports 
throughout and  we expanded the number of cities in which even more speed is offered to include over of our airports and we will continue to increase the number of cities this expedited security feature is offered in as we work with airport authorities 
in  we executed an agreement with viasat inc to develop and introduce state of the art in flight broadband connectivity technology on our aircraft 
in the fall of  viasat successfully launched the satellite which will eventually support this effort 
we continue to develop the in flight broadband connectivity solution and plan to introduce it on our fleet in in  we also expanded our route network 
we commenced service to providenciales  turks and caicos islands in february  anchorage alaska and martha s vineyard in may  la romana  dominican republic and liberia  costa rica in november  and st 
croix and st 
thomas in the us virgin islands in december we have announced plans to begin service between dallas fort worth  texas and boston in may in november  we had the winning bids in an auction to acquire eight take off and landing slots at each of new york s laguardia airport and washington dc s ronald reagan national airport 
we plan to begin our expanded service at each of these airports in 
table of contents another key component in optimizing our route network and managing unit revenues and yield is our continued expansion of our portfolio of strategic commercial partnerships 
during  we added seven new partnerships with prestigious international airlines  bringing our total commercial partnerships to airlines as of december  in  we announced two additional partnerships 
we believe these agreements provide additional revenue opportunities for us and increased travel benefits and opportunities to our customers by allowing access to diverse international markets and a seamless check in process 
our current partnerships are structured with gateways  which allow access for international travelers on many of our key domestic and caribbean routes  including in new york  boston  newark  orlando  fort meyers  san juan  or washington dc 
since re launching our customer loyalty program  trueblue  in november  we have seen a increase in membership 
the program was re designed based on customer feedback  and is aimed at making our frequent flyer benefits more robust  rewarding  and flexible 
trueblue points are earned based on the value paid for a flight as opposed to the length of travel 
there are no blackout dates for award flights and points expirations can be extended 
based on extensive customer surveys  we believe this enhanced program is making our product more appealing to the business customer 
we derive our revenue primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
passenger revenue accounted for of our total operating revenues for the year ended december  revenues generated from international routes  including puerto rico  accounted for of our total passenger revenues in revenue is recognized either when transportation is provided or after the ticket or customer credit expires 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles  which represents the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight which produces higher revenue per available seat mile  or rasm 
our objective is to optimize our fare mix to increase our overall average fare while continuing to provide our customers with competitive fares 
when we enter a new market our fares are designed to stimulate demand  particularly from fare conscious leisure and business travelers who might otherwise have used alternate forms of transportation or would not have traveled at all 
in addition to our regular fare structure  we frequently offer sale fares with shorter advance purchase requirements in most of the markets we serve and match the sale fares offered by other airlines 
passenger revenue also includes revenue from our even more ancillary product offerings 
the highest levels of traffic and revenue on our routes to and from florida are generally realized from october through april and on our routes to and from the western united states in the summer 
our vfr markets continue to complement our leisure driven markets from both a seasonal and day of week perspective 
many of our areas of operations in the northeast experience bad weather conditions in the winter  causing increased costs associated with de icing aircraft  cancelled flights and accommodating displaced customers 
many of our florida and caribbean routes experience bad weather conditions in the summer and fall due to thunderstorms and hurricanes 
as we enter new markets we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with competitive responses to our entry by other airlines 
given our high proportion of fixed costs  this seasonality may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter 
as such  we are currently focused on trying to reduce the seasonal impact of our operations and increase demand and travel during the trough periods 
other revenue consists primarily of fees charged to customers in accordance with our published policies relating to reservation changes and baggage limitations  the marketing component of trueblue point sales  concession revenues  revenues associated with transporting mail and cargo  rental income and revenues earned by our subsidiary  livetv  llc  for the sale of  and on going services provided for  in flight entertainment systems on other airlines 
we operate in an evolving industry  which most recently includes american airlines entering bankruptcy protection as well as the acquisitions of continental airlines by united airlines and of airtran airways by 
table of contents southwest airlines 
we believe building and maintaining solid foundations  including preserving our cost advantage and strong liquidity position  profitable growth and making prudent investments  will allow us to continue our commitment to growing organically  even in this uncertain economic environment 
we have built a strong financial foundation  the cornerstones of which are maintaining one of the best liquidity positions and one of the lowest cost structures in the industry 
this strong foundation affords us the ability to expand and profitably grow our route network and our customer offerings as well as the flexibility to take advantage of market opportunities as they become available  such as the slot auctions in new york and washington dc during in  despite rising fuel prices  our ability to attract higher yielding traffic and execution of our sustainable growth strategy has resulted in a third consecutive year of positive free cash flows  which we define as cash flows from operations less capital expenditures 
in  we invested in five new owned embraer aircraft and four new owned airbus a aircraft to our fleet 
even with the addition of these aircraft  all of which were debt financed  our long term debt balance only grew by a modest million 
in  we made several modifications to our aircraft purchase commitments 
in october  we executed a new purchase agreement with airbus sas  which supersedes our original purchase agreement and related amendments 
in this new agreement  we substituted of our remaining a aircraft deliveries with a aircraft and placed a new order for a new engine option  or aneo  aircraft with delivery scheduled in through we also modified our embraer purchase agreement in  canceling two aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and one aircraft scheduled for delivery in  deferring seven aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and to  and terminating aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and during the second quarter of  we extended the leases on four airbus a aircraft  which were previously set to expire in we may further modify our fleet growth through additional aircraft sales  leasing of aircraft  returns of leased aircraft and or deferral of aircraft deliveries in order to prudently manage our capacity and growth plans 
we believe the new mix of our fleet and revised delivery schedules will allow us to better manage our network and continue to improve upon the jetblue experience we offer to our valued customers 
we maintain one of the lowest cost structures in the industry relative to the product we offer due to the young average age of our fleet  a productive non union workforce  and cost discipline 
during  while building upon our network strategy  we maintained our focus on cost control and ran an efficient operation  which helped mitigate the impact of rising fuel prices 
this was demonstrated in our year over year cost per available seat mile  excluding fuel  which remained relatively flat 
we remain focused on managing those costs within our control as we believe this is crucial to maintaining our competitive advantage 
in  we plan to continue our focus on cost control while improving the jetblue experience for our customers 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel and related taxes and salaries  wages and benefits provided to our crewmembers 
unlike most airlines  we make an investment in our culture by having a policy of not furloughing crewmembers during economic downturns  and we have a non union workforce  which we believe provides us with more flexibility and allows us to be more productive 
however  the increasing seniority of our crewmembers and rising healthcare costs are presenting cost pressures 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel  which is our single largest operating expense  are extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
sales and marketing expenses include advertising  fees paid to credit card companies  and commissions paid for our participation in gdss and otas 
the majority of our customers book their flights directly through our website  our preferred means of distribution  however distribution costs have increased with our increased participation in gdss and otas since maintenance materials and repairs are expensed when incurred unless covered by a third party services contract 
because the average age of our aircraft is years  all of our aircraft currently require less maintenance than they will in the future 
our maintenance costs will increase significantly  both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of our unit costs  as our fleet ages 
we are continuously exploring opportunities to mitigate the increase in maintenance expense  including new or revised business partner agreements and improving 
table of contents operational efficiencies 
other operating expenses consist of purchased services including expenses related to fueling  ground handling  skycap  security and janitorial services  insurance  personnel expenses  cost of goods sold to other airlines by livetv  professional fees  passenger refreshments  supplies  bad debts  communication costs  and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes 
during fuel prices remained volatile  increasing over average prices 
we actively manage our fuel hedge portfolio by entering into a variety of fuel hedge contracts in order to provide some protection against sharp and sudden volatility and further increases in fuel prices 
in total  we hedged of our total fuel consumption 
as of december   we had outstanding fuel hedge contracts covering approximately of our forecasted consumption for the first quarter of and for the full year we will continue to monitor fuel prices closely and intend to take advantage of fuel hedging opportunities as they become available 
the airline industry is one of the most heavily taxed in the us  with taxes and fees accounting for approximately of the total fare charged to a customer 
airlines are obligated to fund all of these taxes and fees regardless of their ability to pass these charges on to the customer 
additionally  if the tsa were to change the way the aviation security infrastructure fee is assessed  our security costs could be higher 
we continue to focus on maintaining an adequate liquidity level 
our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity  thereby managing our capital expenditures to accommodate a sustainable growth plan 
we have manageable scheduled debt maturities in totaling approximately million  which we believe will enable us to achieve our liquidity goals 
during  we pre purchased million of our series a convertible debentures due  as we believe this will help better manage future debt maturities and reduce overall interest expense 
outlook for in  our focus will continue to be on our culture  offerings  and foundations  which we have outlined as key elements of our value proposition 
we anticipate building upon our strong financial foundation during by controlling costs  to the extent possible  in order to maintain a competitive cost advantage and maximizing unit revenues through our unique product offering and focused network strategy 
we aim to deliver improved year over year margins 
we continuously look to expand our other ancillary revenue opportunities and enhance the jetblue experience for all of our customers  leisure and business travelers alike 
we are also focused on managing our future debt maturities and investing in infrastructure and product enhancements that will result in future benefits 
for the full year  we expect our operating capacity to increase approximately to over with the net addition of seven airbus a aircraft and four embraer aircraft to our operating fleet 
assuming fuel prices of per gallon  including fuel taxes and net of our fuel hedging activity  our cost per available seat mile for is expected to increase by to over this expected increase is a result of higher maintenance costs due to the aging of our fleet and assumed increase in fuel prices 
while we expect to face significant cost pressures on maintenance expense in related to the aging of our fleet  we are working diligently to reduce these cost pressures in the future 
results of operations during  overall economic conditions remained volatile and the competitive nature of the airline industry persisted 
we generated consistent unit revenue growth throughout the year by managing our network and balancing the seasonality created by our highly leisure focused business 
we did so by complementing our leisure travel markets with higher yielding business markets and capitalizing on key growth regions  primarily boston and the caribbean  which has resulted in increased capacity 
average fares for the year increased over to and yield increased on a capacity increase of 

table of contents our operations are highly concentrated along the eastern coast of the united states  which at times makes us susceptible to the impact of severe weather

table of contents excludes results of operations and employees of livetv  llc  which are unrelated to our airline operations and are immaterial to our consolidated operating results 
although we experienced significant revenue growth in  this trend may not continue 
we expect our expenses to continue to increase significantly as we acquire additional aircraft  as our fleet ages and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets and enter into new markets 
accordingly  the comparison of the financial data for the quarterly periods presented may not be meaningful 
in addition  we expect our operating results to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future as a result of various factors  many of which are outside our control 
consequently  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
our ability to successfully implement our strategy is dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms 
in addition  our ability to successfully operate our business is dependent on maintaining sufficient liquidity 
we believe that we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash expected to be generated from future operations to continue to meet our obligations as they become due 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december  we also had million of long term investments at december  compared to million at december  cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million in compared to million in and million in the million increase in cash flows from operations in compared to was primarily as a result of the increase in average fares and increase in capacity  offset by higher price of fuel

at this time  we have no plans to sell any such securities 
none of our lenders or lessors are affiliated with us 
capital resources 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from operations to meet our working capital requirements 
substantially all of our property and equipment is encumbered  excluding one aircraft and spare engines which we own 
we have historically financed our aircraft through either secured debt or lease financing 
at december   we operated a fleet of aircraft  of which were financed under operating leases  four were financed under capital leases and all but one of the remaining were financed by secured debt 
we are working on securing committed financing for the four embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery in we may purchase some or all of the seven airbus a aircraft scheduled for delivery in with cash and will only finance these aircraft at favorable borrowing terms relative to our weighted average cost of debt 
although we believe that debt and or lease financing should be available for our remaining aircraft deliveries  we cannot give assurance that we will be able to secure financing on terms attractive to us  if at all 
while these financings may or may not result in an increase in liabilities on our balance sheet  our fixed costs will increase significantly regardless of the financing method ultimately chosen 
to the extent we cannot secure financing  we may be required to pay in cash  further modify our aircraft acquisition plans or incur higher than anticipated financing costs 
working capital 
we had working capital of million at december   compared to million at december  our working capital includes the fair value of our short term fuel hedge derivatives  which was a net liability of million at december  and an asset of million at december  in september  we executed a corporate purchasing line with american express  which allows us to borrow up to a maximum of million 
borrowings cannot exceed million per week and may only be used for the purchase of jet fuel 
borrowings on this corporate purchasing line are subject to our compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement  including certain financial covenants which include a requirement to maintain certain cash and short term investment levels and a minimum earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  margin  as well as customary events of default 
borrowings  which are to be re paid monthly  are subject to a annual interest rate subject to certain limitations 
this borrowing facility will terminate no later than december  since opening the line in september  our average outstanding daily balance was million 
as of december   we had million drawn under this revolving credit facility 
as of january   we had million outstanding on the corporate purchasing line  which was paid in full in early february we expect to meet our obligations as they become due through available cash  investment securities and internally generated funds  supplemented as necessary by financing activities  as they may be available to us 
we expect to continue to generate positive working capital through our operations 
however  we cannot predict what 
table of contents the effect on our business might be from the extremely competitive environment we are operating in or from events that are beyond our control  such as volatile fuel prices  economic conditions  weather related disruptions  the impact of airline bankruptcies  restructurings or consolidations  us military actions or acts of terrorism 
we believe the working capital available to us will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
our scheduled debt maturities are expected to increase over the next five years  with a scheduled peak in of nearly million 
we are actively managing our liquidity to overcome these debt hurdles by pre purchasing convertible debt and other outstanding debt when market conditions allow 
in doing so  we are working to smooth the scheduled debt maturity schedule over the next five years  which will also have the effect of reducing overall interest expense 
anticipated capital expenditures for facility improvements  spare parts and ground purchases in are projected to be approximately million 
contractual obligations our noncancelable contractual obligations at december  include in millions payments due in total thereafter long term debt and capital lease obligations lease commitments flight equipment obligations short term borrowings financing obligations and other total includes actual interest and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates 
amounts include noncancelable commitments for the purchase of goods and services 
the interest rates are fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates adjust quarterly or semi annually based on the london interbank offered rate  or libor 
the weighted average maturity of all of our debt was seven years at december  we are subject to certain financial ratios for our unsecured line of credit issued in september  including a requirement to maintain certain cash and short term investment levels and a minimum earnings before income taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda margin  as well as customary events of default 
we are subject to certain collateral ratio requirements in our spare parts pass through certificates and spare engine financing issued in november and december  respectively 
if we fail to maintain these collateral ratios  we are required to provide additional collateral or redeem some or all of the equipment notes so that the ratios return to compliance 
as a result of lower spare parts inventory balances and the associated reduced third party valuation of these parts  we pledged as collateral a previously unencumbered spare engine with a carrying value of approximately million during the second quarter of during the third quarter of  we did not meet the minimum ratios on our spare parts pass through certificates due to the reduced third party valuation of these parts 
in order to maintain the ratios  we elected to redeem million of the equipment notes to be settled in november at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our debt and lease agreements and of our owned property and equipment were pledged as security under various loan agreements 

table of contents we have operating lease obligations for aircraft with lease terms that expire between and five of these leases have variable rate rent payments that adjust semi annually based on libor 
we also lease airport terminal space and other airport facilities in each of our markets  as well as office space and other equipment 
we have approximately million of restricted assets pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain of our leases which will expire at the end of the related lease terms 
our firm aircraft orders at december  consisted of airbus a aircraft  airbus a aircraft  airbus a neo aircraft and embraer aircraft scheduled for delivery as follows in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in  in and in we meet our predelivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short term borrowing facilities for deposits required six to months prior to delivery 
any predelivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft 
we also have options to acquire additional embraer aircraft for delivery from through our aircraft orders reflect contract modifications undertaken in  including a new purchase agreement with airbus sas  which superseded our original purchase agreement and related amendments 
in this new agreement  we substituted of our then remaining a aircraft deliveries with a aircraft and placed a new order for aneo aircraft with delivery scheduled in through we also modified our embraer purchase agreement in february  canceling two aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in in october  we further amended our embraer purchase agreement  terminating aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and  deferring seven aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in and to and cancelling the order for one embraer aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in some or all of these deferred aircraft may either be returned to their previously committed to delivery dates or cancelled and subject to cancellation fees if we elect not to further amend our purchase agreement to order a new embraer variant  if developed 
in october  we began operating out of our new terminal at jfk  or terminal  which we had been constructing since november the construction and operation of this facility is governed by a lease agreement that we entered into with the panynj in we are responsible for making various payments under the lease  including ground rents for the terminal site which began on lease execution in and facility rents that commenced in october upon our occupancy of the terminal 
the facility rents are based on the number of passengers enplaned out of the terminal  subject to annual minimums 
the panynj has reimbursed us for costs of this project in accordance with the terms of the lease  except for approximately million in leasehold improvements that have been provided by us 
for financial reporting purposes  this project is being accounted for as a financing obligation  with the constructed asset and related liability being reflected on our balance sheets 
minimum ground and facility rents for this terminal totaling billion are included in the commitments table above as lease commitments and financing obligations 
our commitments also include those of livetv  which has several noncancelable long term purchase agreements with its suppliers to provide equipment to be installed on its customers aircraft  including jetblue s aircraft 
we enter into individual employment agreements with each of our faa licensed employees 
each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five year term unless the employee is terminated for cause or the employee elects not to renew it 
pursuant to these agreements  these employees can only be terminated for cause 
in the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours  we are obligated to pay these employees a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits 
as we are not currently obligated to pay this guaranteed income and benefits  no amounts related to these guarantees are included in the table above 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements none of our operating lease obligations are reflected on our balance sheet 
although some of our aircraft lease arrangements are with variable interest entities  as defined by the consolidations topic of the financial accounting standards board s  or fasb  accounting standards codification tm  or codification  none of them require consolidation in our financial statements 
the decision to finance these aircraft through operating leases rather than through debt was based on an analysis of the cash flows and tax consequences of each option and a consideration of additional liquidity requirements 
we are responsible for all maintenance  insurance and other costs associated with operating these aircraft  however  we have not made any residual value or other guarantees to our lessors 
we have determined that we hold a variable interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  certain pass through trusts which are the purchasers of equipment notes issued by us to finance the acquisition of new aircraft and certain aircraft spare parts owned by jetblue and held by such pass through trusts 
these pass through trusts maintain liquidity facilities whereby a third party agrees to make payments sufficient to pay up to months of interest on the applicable certificates if a payment default occurs 
the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates and the spare parts certificates are landesbank hessen th ringen girozentrale and morgan stanley capital services inc the liquidity providers for the series aircraft certificates are landesbank baden w rttemberg and citibank  na we use a policy provider to provide credit support on our class g and class g floating rate enhanced equipment notes 
the policy provider has unconditionally guaranteed the payment of interest on the certificates when due and the payment of principal on the certificates no later than months after the final expected regular distribution date 
the policy provider is mbia insurance corporation a subsidiary of mbia  inc 
financial information for the parent company of the policy provider is available at the sec s website at http www 
sec 
gov or at the sec s public reference room in washington  dc we have also made certain guarantees and indemnities to other unrelated parties that are not reflected on our balance sheet which we believe will not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of our variable interests and other contingencies  including guarantees and indemnities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we maintain a thorough process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimates that are required to prepare our financial statements 
we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ from those estimates 
in addition  estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the policies and estimates discussed below have been reviewed with our independent registered public accounting firm and with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
passenger revenue 
passenger ticket sales are initially deferred in air traffic liability 
the air traffic liability also includes customer credits issued and unused tickets whose travel date has passed 
credit for unused tickets and customer credits can each be applied towards another ticket within months of the original 
table of contents scheduled service or months from the issuance of the customer credit 
revenue is recognized when transportation is provided or when a ticket or customer credit expires 
we also defer  in air traffic liability  an estimate for customer credits issued in conjunction with the jetblue airways customer bill of rights we expect to be ultimately redeemed 
these estimates are based on historical experience and are periodically evaluated  and adjusted if necessary  based on actual credit usage 
frequent flyer accounting 
we utilize a number of estimates in accounting for our trueblue customer loyalty program  or trueblue 
we record a liability  which was and million as of december  and  respectively  for the estimated incremental cost of outstanding points earned from jetblue purchases that we expect to be redeemed 
the estimated cost includes incremental fuel  insurance  passenger food and supplies  and reservation costs 
we adjust this liability  which is included in air traffic liability  based on points earned and redeemed  changes in the estimated incremental costs associated with providing travel and changes in the trueblue program 
in november  we launched an improved version of trueblue  which allows customers to earn points based on the value paid for a trip rather than the length of the trip 
in addition  unlike our original program  the improved version does not result in the automatic generation of a travel award once minimum award levels are reached  but instead the points are maintained in the account until used by the member or until they expire months after the last account activity 
as a result of these changes  breakage  or the points that ultimately expire unused  has been substantially reduced 
periodically  we evaluate our assumptions for appropriateness  including comparison of the cost estimates to actual costs incurred as well as the expiration and redemption assumptions to actual experience 
changes in the minimum award levels or in the lives of the awards would also require us to reevaluate the liability  potentially resulting in a significant impact in the year of change as well as in future years 
points in trueblue can also be sold to participating companies  including credit card and car rental companies 
these sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  with one element representing the fair value of the travel that will ultimately be provided when the points are redeemed and the other consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company 
the fair value of the transportation portion of these point sales is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when transportation is provided 
the marketing portion  which is the excess of the total sales proceeds over the estimated fair value of the transportation to be provided  is recognized in other revenue when the points are sold 
deferred revenue for points sold and not redeemed is recognized as revenue when the underlying points expire 
deferred revenue was and million at december  and  respectively 
the terms of expiration of all points under our original loyalty program were modified with the launch of a new version of trueblue in we recorded million and million in revenue for point expirations in and  respectively 
our co branded credit card agreement  under which we sell trueblue points as described above  provided for a minimum cash payment guarantee  which was paid to us throughout the life of the agreement if specified point sales and other ancillary activity payments were not achieved and was subject to refund in the event that cash payments exceeded future minimums through april we recorded revenue related to this guarantee when the likelihood of us providing any future service was remote 
during  we recognized approximately million related to this guarantee  which represented the balance under this guarantee 
during  we recognized approximately million related to this guarantee 
accounting for long lived assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  we make estimates about the expected useful lives  projected residual values and the potential for impairment 
in estimating useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  we have relied upon actual industry experience with the same or similar aircraft types and our anticipated utilization of the aircraft 
changing market prices of new and used aircraft  government regulations and changes in our maintenance program or operations could result in changes to these estimates 
our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
indicators include operating or cash flow losses  significant decreases in 
table of contents market value or changes in technology 
as our assets are all relatively new and we continue to have positive operating cash flows  we have not identified any significant impairment related to our long lived assets at this time 
lease accounting 
we operate airport facilities  offices buildings and aircraft under operating leases with minimum lease payments associated with these agreements recognized as rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term 
within the provisions of certain leases there are minimum escalations in payments over the base lease term and periodic adjustments of lease rates  landing fees  and other charges applicable under such agreements  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of the escalations and other adjustments have been reflected in rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term  which includes renewal periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the lease that we would incur an economic penalty for not renewing 
the amortization period for leasehold improvements is the term used in calculating straight line rent expense or their estimated economic life  whichever is shorter 
derivative instruments used for aircraft fuel 
we utilize financial derivative instruments to manage the risk of changing aircraft fuel prices 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative instrument for trading purposes 
at december   we had a net million liability related to the net fair value of these derivative instruments  the majority of which are not traded on a public exchange 
fair values are assigned based on commodity prices that are provided to us by independent third parties 
when possible  we designate these instruments as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes  as defined by the derivatives and hedging topic of the codification which permits the deferral of the effective portions of gains or losses until contract settlement 
the derivatives and hedging topic is a complex accounting standard and requires that we develop and maintain a significant amount of documentation related to our fuel hedging program and strategy  statistical analysis supporting a highly correlated relationship between the underlying commodity in the derivative financial instrument and the risk being hedged ie aircraft fuel on both a historical and prospective basis and cash flow designation for each hedging transaction executed  to be developed concurrently with the hedging transaction 
this documentation requires that we estimate forward aircraft fuel prices since there is no reliable forward market for aircraft fuel 
these prices are developed through the observation of similar commodity futures prices  such as crude oil and or heating oil  and adjusted based on variations to those like commodities 
historically  our hedges have settled within months  therefore  the deferred gains and losses have been recognized into earnings over a relatively short period of time 
fair value measurements 
the fair value measurements and disclosures topic of the codification clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
the fair value measurements and disclosures topic also requires disclosure about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped  based on significant levels of inputs 
we rely on unobservable level inputs  which are highly subjective  in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities  including our interest rate swaps 
we elected to apply the fair value option under the financial instruments topic of the codification to an agreement with one of our ars broker  to repurchase in  ars brokered by them at par 
the fair value of the put was determined by comparing the fair value of the related ars to their par values and also considered the credit risk associated with the broker 
this put option was adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 
the fair value of the put option was based on unobservable inputs and was therefore classified as level in the hierarchy 
this put option was fully exercised in upon its expiration 
in and  we entered into various interest rate swaps  which qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with the derivatives and hedging topic 
the fair values of our interest rate swaps were initially based on inputs received from the counterparty 
these values were corroborated by adjusting the active swap indications in quoted markets for similar terms years for the specific terms within our swap agreements 

table of contents there has been no ineffectiveness relating to these interest rate swaps since all critical terms continue to match the underlying debt  with all of the unrealized losses being deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes to the price of fuel and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on the overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
variable rate leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
actual results may differ 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for accounting policies and additional information 
aircraft fuel 
our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel 
to manage the price risk  we use crude or heating oil option contracts or jet fuel swap agreements 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase in the december  cost per gallon of fuel 
based on projected fuel consumption  such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately million in  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  as of december   we had hedged approximately of our projected fuel requirements 
all hedge contracts existing at december  settle by december  we expect to realize approximately million in losses during currently in other comprehensive income related to our outstanding fuel hedge contracts 
interest 
our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances 
the interest rate is fixed for billion of our debt and capital lease obligations  with the remaining billion having floating interest rates 
if interest rates average higher in than they did during  our interest expense would increase by approximately million  compared to an estimated million for measured as of december  if interest rates average lower in than they did during  our interest income from cash and investment balances would remain relatively constant  similar to the relative constant level of interest income for measured as of december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate debt  cash equivalents and investment securities balances at december  and fixed rate debt 
on december   our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debt had a total estimated fair value of million  based on quoted market prices 
if interest rates were higher than the stated rate  the fair value of this debt would have been million as of december
