item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion on our internal growth activities 
our capital expenditure budget is approximately million with much of this related to internal growth activities comprised of expansions of existing facilities and purchases of equipment as well as establishing a presence in new geographic markets 
we also plan to move out of various leased facilities and into newly built and or purchased ones 
we will continue to evaluate and execute additional growth projects as appropriate  given the economic conditions and outlook at the time 
we have the ability to significantly scale back our capital expenditures  if needed 
our executive officers maintain a control environment that is focused on integrity and ethical behavior  establish general policies and operating guidelines and monitor adherence to proper financial controls  while our division managers and subsidiary officers have autonomy with respect to day to day operations 
this balanced  yet entrepreneurial  management style has enabled us to improve the productivity and profitability both of acquired businesses and of our own expanded operations 
key management personnel are eligible for incentive compensation based  in part  on the profitability of their particular division or subsidiary and  in part  on the company s overall profitability 
we seek to increase our profitability by expanding our existing operations and acquiring businesses that diversify or enhance our customer base  product range  processing services and geographic coverage 
we have developed and maintained an excellent reputation in the industry for our integrity and the quality and timeliness of our service to customers 

table of contents customers and markets our customers purchase from us and other metals service centers to obtain value added metals processing  readily available inventory  reliable and timely delivery  flexible minimum order size and quality control 
many of our customers deal exclusively with service centers because the quantities of metal products that they purchase are smaller than the minimum orders specified by mills  because those customers require intermittent deliveries over long or irregular periods  or because those customers require specialized processing services 
we believe that metals service centers have also enjoyed an increasing share of total metal shipments due to the focus of the capital goods and other manufacturing industries on just in time inventory management and materials management outsourcing  and because metal producers have reduced in house direct sales efforts to small sporadic purchasers in order to enhance their production efficiency 
the consolidation of carbon steel mills that occurred during the to period further reduced the number of potential sources of metal available to customers purchasing small quantities of metal 
we have more than  customers in various industries 
our customers are manufacturers and end users in the general manufacturing  non residential construction  transportation rail  truck trailer and shipbuilding  aerospace  energy  electronics and semiconductor fabrication and related industries 
in  many of our suppliers also became our customers as a result of our purchase of precision strip inc  which typically sells processing services  but not metal  to larger customers  such as mills and original equipment manufacturers oem s  and in larger annual volumes than we have experienced historically 
precision strip also has indirectly increased our participation in the auto and appliance end markets with the auto exposure primarily relating to the processing and delivery of metal for the transplants  or new domestic companies 
our metals service centers wrote and delivered over  orders during at an average price of approximately  per order 
most of our metals service center customers are located within a mile radius of the metals service center serving them 
the proximity of our service centers to our customers helps us provide just in time delivery to our customers as well as increases the likelihood of repeat business 
in  approximately of our orders were from repeat customers 
with our fleet of approximately  trucks some of which are leased  we are able to service many smaller customers 
moreover  our computerized order entry systems and flexible production scheduling enable us to meet customer requirements for short lead times and just in time delivery 
we believe that our long term relationships with many of our customers significantly contribute to the success of our business 
due to increased volatility and uncertainty in metal costs in recent years  more customers have migrated to smaller  more frequent purchases of metal so they can maintain lean inventories  which fits our operating model 
providing prompt and efficient services and quality products at reasonable prices are important factors in maintaining and expanding these relationships 
our acquisitions in recent years have increased our international exposure both from a customer and physical location perspective 
in addition  we have built and opened international locations in recent years to service specific industries  typically to support key customers that are operating in those international markets 
net sales of our international locations based on where the shipments originated accounted for approximately of our net sales  or million 
however  our net sales to international customers based on the shipping destination were approximately of our net sales or million  with approximately of these sales  or million  to canadian customers 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information on us and foreign revenues and assets 
customer demand may change from time to time based on  among other things  general economic conditions and industry capacity 
many of the industries in which our customers compete are cyclical in nature 
because we sell to a wide variety of customers in many industries  we believe that the effect of such changes on us is significantly reduced 
in addition  many of our customers are small job shops and 
table of contents fabricators who also have a diverse customer base and have the versatility to service different end markets when an existing market slows 
throughout  we experienced consistently improving monthly demand 
our same store tons shipped in were up by from levels 
in  most major industries we serve experienced improved demand  including our strongest end markets of oil gas  farm and heavy equipment  mining  aerospace  semiconductor and electronics 
certain of our other major end markets also continued to be strong  including barge and tank manufacturing  transmission towers  wind towers  solar  general manufacturing and railcars 
non residential construction volumes increased slightly in over levels  but lagged the improvements seen in other markets and currently remain below historic levels 
we believe non residential construction is our largest end market and represents about of our business 
our involvement in the automotive industry is primarily through our toll processing operations where we have no inventory exposure 
the diversity of our customer base somewhat reduces the impact of any single customer  as no customer in represented more than of our sales 
we had customers with annual sales greater than million 
california was our largest market for many years  but we have expanded our geographic coverage in recent years and the midwest region of the united states has become our largest market 
california represented of our sales  which is a significant decrease from of our sales  however  the dollar amount of our sales in california has more than doubled since that time 
the midwest region  which we entered in  is now our largest region with of our sales 
the geographic breakout of our sales based on the location of our metals service center facilities in each of the three years ended december was as follows midwest southeast west southwest california northeast mid atlantic international pacific northwest mountain total suppliers we purchase our inventory primarily from the major domestic metals mills  however we do purchase certain products from foreign mills 
we have multiple suppliers for all of our product lines 
our major suppliers of domestic carbon steel products include arcelormittal  california steel industries  inc  evraz na  gerdau ameristeel corporation including chaparral steel company  nucor corporation  steel dynamics  inc  ssab and united states steel corporation 
ak steel  allegheny technologies incorporated  north american stainless and thyssenkrupp inoxum group supply stainless steel products 
we are a recognized distributor for various major aluminum companies  including alcoa inc  aleris international  inc  constellium global ati  kaiser aluminum corp  novelis inc and sapa group 
from through  many domestic steel mills entered bankruptcy proceedings  which resulted in significant consolidation 
due to somewhat improved demand  us carbon steel mills are now operating at of capacity  up from less than in  but well below and prior levels 
limited imports 
table of contents to the us and increased raw material costs have generally supported higher prices for carbon steel since however  us prices are currently higher than most other parts of the world for many products and imports have increased  which could pressure us pricing downward 
there has been significant volatility in carbon steel pricing since  generally with wider swings than was experienced prior to this time  however  the low end of the pricing in each cycle has been well above pricing levels prior to because of our total volume of purchases and our long term relationships with our suppliers  we believe that we are generally able to purchase inventory at the best prices offered by the suppliers  given the order size 
we believe that we are not dependent on any one of our suppliers for metals 
from to  when the supply of certain metals was tight  we believe that these relationships provided an advantage to us in our ability to source product and have it available for our customers 
we believe our size and strong relationships with our suppliers are now more important because mill consolidation has somewhat reduced the number of suppliers 
backlog because of the just in time delivery and the short lead time nature of our business  we do not believe information on our backlog of orders is material to an understanding of our business 
products and processing services we provide a wide variety of processing services to meet our customers specifications and deliver products to fabricators  manufacturers and other end users 
we maintain a wide variety of products in inventory 
we often deliver orders that do not require extensive or specialized processing to the customer within hours of receiving the order 
our product mix has changed mainly as a result of our acquisitions  which are focused on more specialized items as opposed to pure commodity products 
flat rolled carbon steel products ie  hot rolled  cold rolled and galvanized steel sheet and coil  which generally have the most volatile and competitive pricing  accounted for only of our sales 

table of contents our sales dollars by product type as a percentage of total sales in each of the three years ended december were as follows carbon steel plate carbon steel structurals carbon steel tubing carbon steel bar hot rolled steel sheet and coil galvanized steel sheet and coil cold rolled steel sheet and coil carbon steel aluminum bar and tube heat treated aluminum plate common alloy aluminum sheet and coil common alloy aluminum plate heat treated aluminum sheet and coil aluminum stainless steel bar and tube stainless steel sheet and coil stainless steel plate stainless steel alloy bar and rod alloy tube alloy plate  sheet and coil alloy toll processing of aluminum  carbon steel and stainless steel miscellaneous  including brass  copper and titanium total we are not dependent on any particular customer group or industry because we process and distribute a variety of metals 
because of this diversity of product type and material  we believe that we are less exposed to fluctuations or other weaknesses in the financial or economic stability of particular customers or industries 
we are also less dependent on particular suppliers 
for sheet and coil products  we purchase coiled metal from primary producers in the form of a continuous sheet  typically to inches wide  between 
and 
inches thick  and rolled into to ton coils 
the size and weight of these coils require specialized equipment to move and process the coils into smaller sizes and various products 
many of the other products that we carry also require specialized equipment 
few of our customers have the capability to process the metal into the desired sizes 
after receiving an order  we enter it into one of our computerized order entry systems  select appropriate inventory and schedule the processing to meet the specified delivery date 
in  we delivered approximately of our orders within hours of the customer placing the order with us 
we 
table of contents attempt to maximize the yield from the various metals that we process by combining customer orders to use each product that we purchase to the fullest extent practicable 
few metals service centers offer the full scope of processing services and metals that we provide 
in addition to our focus on growing in specialty products  we have also enhanced the level of value added services with recent acquisitions 
diamond manufacturing was our first entry into perforating metal for our customers and we just expanded our ability to provide this service with our purchase of mckey 
continental alloys provides more complex machining and threading of products than we typically perform  generating higher margins 
we have also significantly upgraded and expanded our processing capabilities with significant investments in new equipment over the past few years 
in  we performed processing services for approximately of our sales orders 
our primary processing services range from cutting  leveling or sawing to complete processes such as machining or electropolishing 
throughout our service centers we perform most processes performed in the industry  without encroaching upon the services performed by our customers 
we generally process specific metals to non standard sizes only at the request of customers pursuant to purchase orders 
we do not maintain a significant inventory of finished products  but we carry a wide range of metals to meet the short lead time and just in time delivery requirements of our customers 
our metals service centers maintain inventory and equipment selected to meet the needs of that facility s customers 
marketing as of december   we had approximately  sales personnel located in states  belgium  canada  china  france  malaysia  mexico  singapore  south korea  the uae and the united kingdom that provide marketing services throughout each of those areas  as well as nearby locations 
the sales personnel are organized by division or subsidiary among our profit centers and are divided into two groups 
our outside sales personnel are considered those personnel who travel throughout a specified geographic territory to maintain relationships with our existing customers and develop new customers 
those sales personnel who remain at the facilities to write and price orders are our inside sales personnel 
the inside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation  in addition to their base salary  based on the gross profit and or pretax profit of their particular profit center 
the outside sales personnel generally receive incentive compensation based on the gross profit from their particular geographic territories 
competition the metals distribution industry is highly fragmented and competitive 
we have numerous competitors in each of our product lines and geographic locations  and competition is most frequently local or regional 
our competitors are smaller than we are  but we still face strong competition from national  regional and local independent metals distributors and the producers themselves  some of which have greater resources than we do 
as reported by ibisworld inc in their december report on the metals service center industry  it is estimated that there were approximately  metal wholesale locations in the united states operated by more than  companies in the four largest us metals service center companies represented less than of the estimated billion industry total in our revenues of billion in accounted for about of the entire us market 
we believe we continue to be the largest north american us and canada metals service center company on a revenue basis 
we compete with other companies on price  service  quality and availability of products 
we maintain centralized relationships with our major suppliers and a decentralized operational structure 
we believe that this division of responsibility has increased our ability to obtain competitive prices of metals and to provide more responsive service to our customers 
in addition  we believe that the size of our inventory  the different metals and products we have available  and the wide variety of processing services we provide distinguish us from our competition 
we believe that we have increased our market share during recent years due to our strong financial condition  our high quality of products and services  our acquisitions and opportunities created by the activities of certain of our competitors  as well as our continued focus on small order sizes with quick turnaround 

table of contents quality control procuring high quality metal from suppliers on a consistent basis is critical to our business 
we have instituted strict quality control measures to assure that the quality of purchased raw materials will enable us to meet our customers specifications and to reduce the costs of production interruptions 
in certain instances  we perform physical and chemical analyses on selected raw materials  typically through a third party testing lab  to verify that their mechanical and dimensional properties  cleanliness and surface characteristics meet our requirements and our customers specifications 
we also conduct certain analyses of surface characteristics on selected processed metal before delivery to the customer 
we believe that maintaining high standards for accepting metals ultimately results in reduced return rates from our customers 
we maintain various quality certifications throughout our operations with about half of our operations iso certified 
many of our locations maintain additional certifications specific to the industries they serve  such as aerospace  auto  nuclear  and others  including certain international certifications 
systems we maintain various software applications across our operations that are tailored to the specific needs of those operations 
generally  these systems provide information in real time  such as inventory availability  location and cost and are customized with features to accommodate the products the respective operations carry  automated equipment interfaces  or other specialized needs 
with this information  our marketing and sales personnel can respond to our customers needs more efficiently and more effectively 
these systems are included in our internal control testing 
a common financial reporting system  as well as certain other accounting  tax and hris packages are used company wide 
we have also initiated efforts to identify the appropriate system solutions to provide a common erp platform across our operating companies and to develop more efficient means of consolidating data 
this is a multi phased  multi year project that will be pursued and implemented in a manner to limit both operational and financial risk 
government regulation our metals service centers are subject to many foreign  federal  state and local requirements to protect the environment  including hazardous waste disposal and underground storage tank regulations 
the only hazardous substances that we generally use in our operations are lubricants  cleaning solvents and petroleum for fueling our trucks 
we pay state certified private companies to haul and dispose of our hazardous waste 
our operations are also subject to laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health  principally the occupational health and safety act and related regulations  which  among other requirements  establish noise  dust and safety standards 
we maintain comprehensive health and safety policies and encourage our employees to follow established safety practices 
we encourage social well being by instituting these high quality labor  health and safety standards 
we do not anticipate that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
certain of our operations sell metal to foreign customers  subjecting us to various export compliance  fcpa and other regulations 
we have implemented company wide export and fcpa compliance programs to monitor adherence to our policies and to provide appropriate training to our operating personnel 
although the amount of our sales that are subject to export compliance  fcpa and other regulations may only be a small percentage of our total sales  penalties assessed to any violations in connection with these sales may be material 
although we have implemented policies and procedures to comply with these 
table of contents regulations  we cannot guarantee that we will not incur any violations and resulting penalties from such activity 
environmental some of the properties we own or lease are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use 
we may incur some environmental liabilities because of the location of these properties 
in addition  we are currently involved with certain environmental remediation projects related to activities at former manufacturing operations of emj  our wholly owned subsidiary  that were sold many years prior to reliance s acquisition of emj in although the potential cleanup costs could be significant  emj had insurance policies in place at the time they owned the manufacturing operations that are expected to cover the majority of the related costs 
the company does not expect that these obligations will have a material adverse impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that all scrap metal produced by our operations is recycled by the independent scrap metal companies and producers that we sell to 
we continue to evaluate and implement energy conservation and other initiatives to reduce pollution 
if more stringent environmental regulations are enacted this could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
approximately of the employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements  which expire at various times over the next five years 
we have entered into collective bargaining agreements with union locals at of our locations 
these collective bargaining agreements have not had a material impact either favorably or unfavorably on our revenues or profitability at our various locations 
we have always maintained excellent relations with our employees 
over the years we have experienced minor work stoppages by our employees at certain of our locations  but due to the small number of employees and the short time periods involved  these stoppages have not had a material impact on our operations 
we have never experienced a significant work stoppage 
seasonality some of our customers are in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers

item a 
risk factors set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to our investors 
our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected due to any of the following risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business 
this section contains forward looking statements 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of this report 
risks related to our business and industry our indebtedness could impair our financial condition and reduce the funds available to us for other purposes and our failure to comply with the covenants contained in our debt instruments could result in an event of default that could adversely affect our operating results 
we have substantial debt service obligations 
as of december   we had aggregate outstanding indebtedness of approximately billion 
this indebtedness could adversely affect us in the following ways additional financing may not be available to us in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes and  if available  may be considerably more costly than our current debt costs  a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our debt  which reduces the funds available to us for our operations or other purposes  some of the interest on our debt is  and will continue to be  accrued at variable rates  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates  which may occur in future periods  because we may be more leveraged than some of our competitors  our debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage  our leverage may increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and limit our ability to withstand adverse events in our business by limiting our financial alternatives  and our ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities  including potential acquisitions  and to plan for  or respond to  competition and changes in our business may be limited 
our existing debt agreements contain financial and restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional debt  and to engage in other activities that we may believe are in our long term best interests  including the disposition or acquisition of assets or other companies or the payment of dividends to our shareholders 
our failure to comply with these covenants may result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness or prevent us from accessing additional funds under our credit facility 
if the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not have sufficient cash resources to satisfy our debt obligations and we may not be able to continue our operations as planned 
see discussion regarding our financial covenants in the liquidity and capital resources section of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our existing debt service obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which will be affected by a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside of our control 
for example  we may not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or new acquisitions to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility when it matures in  our private notes when they mature in or our debt securities when they mature in and if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or have availability to borrow on our credit facility to satisfy our debt obligations  we expect to undertake alternative financing plans  such as refinancing or restructuring our debt  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital investments or seeking to raise additional capital 
we may not be able to consummate any such transaction at all or on a timely basis or on terms  and for proceeds  that are acceptable to us 
these transactions may not be permitted under the terms of our various debt instruments then in effect 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations or to timely refinance our obligations on acceptable terms could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers and could cause us to reduce or discontinue our planned operations 
the costs that we pay for metals fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond our control  and such fluctuations could adversely affect our operating results  particularly if we cannot pass on higher metal prices to our customers 
we purchase large quantities of aluminum  carbon  alloy and stainless steel and other metals  which we sell to a variety of end users 
the costs to us for these metals and the prices that we charge customers for our products may change depending on many factors outside of our control  including general economic conditions both domestic and international  competition  production levels  raw material costs  customer demand levels  import duties and other trade restrictions  currency fluctuations and surcharges imposed by our suppliers 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers with higher selling prices but we may not always be able to do so  particularly when the cost increases are not demand driven 
we maintain substantial inventories of metal to accommodate the short lead times and delivery requirements of our customers 
our customers typically purchase products from us pursuant to purchase orders and typically do not enter into long term purchase agreements or arrangements with us 
accordingly  we purchase metal in quantities we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based on information derived from customers  market conditions  historic usage and industry research 
commitments for metal purchases are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time orders are placed or at the time of shipment 
during periods of rising prices for metal  we may be negatively impacted by delays between the time of increases in the cost of metals to us and increases in the prices that we charge for our products if we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers immediately 
in addition  when metal prices decline  this could result in lower selling prices for our products and  as we use existing inventory that we purchased at higher metal prices  lower margins 
consequently  during periods in which we sell this existing inventory  the effects of changing metal prices could adversely affect our operating results 
our business could be adversely affected by economic downturns 
demand for our products is affected by a number of general economic factors 
a decline in economic activity in the us and other markets in which we operate could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
during the most recent us economic recession  both demand for our products and pricing levels declined rapidly and significantly 
in addition to reducing our direct business activity  many of our customers were not able to pay us amounts when they became due  further affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
although the us recession has ended  overall demand for our products continues to be at lower levels than we believe to be more normal levels  particularly for non residential construction activity 
we have little visibility as to if or when demand will return to 
table of contents pre recession levels  which may continue to threaten the financial viability of our customers and their ability to pay us and may cause our financial condition to worsen from current levels 
if the european financial crisis worsens or europe enters a recession  this could have a negative global impact on all of our locations 
the prices of metals are subject to fluctuations in the supply and demand for metals worldwide and changes in the worldwide balance of supply and demand could negatively impact our revenues  gross profit and net income 
metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
for example  in the past few years  china has significantly increased both its consumption and production of metals and metal products to support its growth 
initially  china s large and growing demand for metals significantly affected the metals industry by diverting supply to china and contributing to the global increases in metal prices 
with china s increased production of metals  it has become a significant buyer of natural resources and a net exporter of certain metals 
future changes in china s general economic conditions or in its production  consumption or export of metals could cause fluctuations in metal prices globally  which could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
additionally  significant currency fluctuations in the united states or abroad could negatively impact our cost of metals and the pricing of our products 
a decline in the dollar relative to foreign currencies may result in increased prices for metals and metal products in the united states and reduce the amount of metal imported into the us as imported metals become relatively more expensive 
if the value of the dollar improves relative to foreign currencies  this may result in increased metal being imported into the us  which in turn may pressure existing domestic prices for metal 
in addition  when prices for metal products in the us are lower than in foreign markets  metals may be sold in the foreign markets rather than in the us  reducing the availability of metal products in the us  which may allow the domestic mills to increase their prices 
we operate in an industry that is subject to cyclical fluctuations and any downturn in general economic conditions or in our customers specific industries could negatively impact our revenues  gross profit and net income 
the metals service center industry is cyclical and impacted by both market demand and metals supply 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states or other countries  or the public perception that these may occur  could decrease the demand for our products and adversely affect our pricing 
if either demand or pricing were to decline from the current levels  this could reduce our revenues  gross profit and net income 
we sell many products to industries that are cyclical  such as the non residential construction  semiconductor  energy and transportation industries  including aerospace 
although many of our direct sales are to sub contractors or job shops that may serve many customers and industries  the demand for our products is directly related to  and quickly impacted by  demand for the finished goods manufactured by customers in these industries  which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy  domestic exchange rates  energy prices or other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to accurately project the product needs of our customers over varying lead times or if there is a limited availability of products through allocation by the mills or otherwise  we may not have sufficient inventory to be able to provide products desired by our customers on a timely basis 
in addition  if we are not able to diversify our customer base and or increase sales of products to customers in other industries when one or more of the cyclical industries that we serve are experiencing a decline  our revenues  gross profit and net income may be adversely affected 

table of contents we compete with a large number of companies in the metals service center industry  and  if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenues  gross profit and net income may decline 
we compete with a large number of other general line distributors and specialty distributors in the metals service center industry 
competition is based principally on price  inventory availability  timely delivery  customer service  quality and processing capabilities 
competition in the various markets in which we participate comes from companies of various sizes  some of which have more established brand names in the local markets that we serve 
these competitors may be better able to withstand adverse changes in conditions within our customers industries and may have greater operating and financial flexibility than we have 
to compete for customer sales  we may lower prices or offer increased services at a higher cost  which could reduce our revenues  gross profit and net income 
the significantly lower demand levels during and rapidly declining prices escalated competitive pressures  with service centers selling at substantially reduced prices  and sometimes at a loss  in an effort to reduce their high cost inventory and generate cash 
these competitive pressures could intensify again if demand and particularly pricing decline significantly from current levels 
any increased competitive pressure could cause our revenues  gross profit and net income to decline further 
if we were to lose any of our primary suppliers or otherwise be unable to obtain sufficient amounts of necessary metals on a timely basis  we may not be able to meet our customers needs and may suffer reduced sales 
we have few long term contracts to purchase metals 
therefore  our primary suppliers of carbon steel  alloy steel  stainless steel  aluminum or other metals could curtail or discontinue their delivery of these metals to us in the quantities we need with little or no notice 
our ability to meet our customers needs and provide value added inventory management services depends on our ability to maintain an uninterrupted supply of high quality metal products from our suppliers 
if our suppliers experience production problems  lack of capacity or transportation disruptions  the lead times for receiving our supply of metal products could be extended and the cost of our inventory may increase 
if  in the future  we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of the necessary metals at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our customary suppliers  we may not be able to obtain these metals from acceptable alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedules 
even if we do find acceptable alternative suppliers  the process of locating and securing these alternatives may be disruptive to our business  which could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet our customers needs and reduce our sales  gross profit and net income 
in addition  if a significant domestic supply source is discontinued and we cannot find acceptable domestic alternatives  we may need to find a foreign source of supply 
using foreign sources of supply could result in longer lead times  increased price volatility  less favorable payment terms  increased exposure to foreign currency movements and certain tariffs and duties and require greater levels of working capital 
alternative sources of supply may not maintain the quality standards that are in place with our current suppliers that could impact our ability to provide the same quality of products to our customers that we have provided in the past  which could cause our customers to move their business to our competitors or to file claims against us  which may be more difficult to pass through to foreign suppliers 
there has been significant consolidation at the metal producer level both globally and within the us this consolidation has reduced the number of suppliers available to us  which could result in increased metals costs to us that we may not be able to pass on to our customers and may limit our ability to obtain the necessary metals to service our customers 
the number of available suppliers may be further reduced if we enter into another recession 
lower metal prices and lower demand levels caused certain mills to reduce their production capacity and  in many cases  to operate at a loss  which could cause one or more mills to discontinue operations if the losses continue over an extended period of time or if the mill cannot obtain the necessary financing to fund its operating costs 

table of contents we rely upon our suppliers as to the specifications of the metals we purchase from them 
we rely on mill certifications that attest to the physical and chemical specifications of the metal received from our suppliers for resale and generally  consistent with industry practice  do not undertake independent testing of such metals 
we rely on our customers to notify us of any metal that does not conform to the specifications certified by the supplying mill 
although our primary sources of products have been domestic mills  we have and will continue to purchase product from foreign suppliers when we believe it is appropriate 
in the event that metal purchased from domestic suppliers is deemed to not meet quality specifications as set forth in the mill certifications or customer specifications  we generally have recourse against these suppliers for both the cost of the products purchased and possible claims from our customers 
however  such recourse will not compensate us for the damage to our reputation that may arise from sub standard products and possible losses of customers 
moreover  there is a greater level of risk that similar recourse will not be available to us in the event of claims by our customers related to products from foreign suppliers that do not meet the specifications set forth in the mill certifications 
in such circumstances  we may be at greater risk of loss for claims for which we do not carry  or do not carry sufficient  insurance 
if we do not successfully implement our acquisition growth strategy  our ability to grow our business could be impaired 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully complete any acquisitions or integrate any other businesses into our operations 
if we cannot identify suitable acquisition candidates or are otherwise unable to complete acquisitions  we are unlikely to sustain our historical growth rates  and  if we cannot successfully integrate these businesses  we may incur increased or redundant expenses 
moreover  any additional indebtedness we incur to pay for these acquisitions could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of that transaction 
historically  we have expanded both through acquisitions and internal growth 
since our initial public offering in september  we have successfully purchased more than businesses 
from to september  we acquired businesses 
we continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and expect to continue to grow our business through acquisitions in the future 
risks we may encounter in acquisitions include the acquired company may not further our business strategy  or we may pay more than it is worth  the acquired company may not perform as anticipated  which could result in an impairment charge or otherwise impact our results of operations  we may not realize the anticipated increase in our revenues if a larger than predicted number of customers decline to continue purchasing products from us  we may have to delay or not proceed with a substantial acquisition if we cannot obtain the necessary funding to complete the acquisition in a timely manner  we may significantly increase our interest expense  leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or assume existing debt of an acquired company  which  among other things  may result in a downgrade of our credit ratings  we may have multiple and overlapping product lines that may be offered  priced and supported differently  which could cause our gross profit margins to decline  we may have increased inventory exposure for a short time period if the acquired company had significant amounts of material on order  
table of contents our relationship with current and new employees  customers and suppliers could be impaired  our due diligence process may fail to identify risks that could negatively impact our financial condition  we may lose anticipated tax benefits or have additional legal or tax exposures if we have prematurely or improperly combined entities  we may face contingencies related to product liability  intellectual property  financial disclosures  tax positions and accounting practices or internal controls  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees or third parties  our management s attention may be diverted by transition or integration issues  and we may be unable to obtain timely approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or a number of acquisitions 
as a decentralized business  we depend on both senior management and our key operating employees  if we are unable to attract and retain these individuals  our ability to operate and grow our business may be adversely affected 
because of our decentralized operating style  we depend on the efforts of our senior management  including our chairman and chief executive officer  david h 
hannah  our president and chief operating officer  gregg j 
mollins  and our executive vice president and chief financial officer  karla lewis  as well as our key operating employees 
we may not be able to retain these individuals or attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our corporate officers or most of our key employees  so they may have less of an incentive to stay with us when presented with alternative employment opportunities 
the compensation of our officers and key employees is heavily dependent on our profitability and in times of reduced profitability this may cause our employees to seek employment opportunities that provide a more stable compensation structure 
in addition  our senior management and key operating employees hold stock options that have vested and may also hold common stock in our employee stock ownership plan 
these individuals may  therefore  be more likely to leave us if the shares of our common stock significantly appreciate in value 
the loss of any key officer or employee will require remaining officers and employees to direct immediate and substantial attention to seeking a replacement 
our inability to retain members of our senior management or key operating employees or to find adequate replacements for any departing key officer or employee on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to operate and grow our business 
we are subject to various environmental  employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations  which could subject us to significant liabilities and compliance expenditures 
we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  wastewater discharges  underground storage tanks and solid and hazardous waste disposal at or from our facilities 
our operations are also subject to various employee safety and health laws and regulations  including those concerning occupational injury and illness  employee exposure to hazardous materials and employee complaints 
we are also subject to customs and exporting laws and regulations for international shipment of our products 
environmental  employee safety and health and customs and export laws and regulations are comprehensive  complex and frequently changing 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
we may be subject from time to time to administrative and or judicial proceedings or investigations brought by private parties or governmental agencies with respect to environmental matters  employee safety and health issues or 
table of contents customs and exporting issues 
proceedings and investigations with respect to environmental matters  any employee safety and health issues or customs and exporting issues could result in substantial costs to us  divert our management s attention and result in significant liabilities  fines or the suspension or interruption of our service center activities 
some of our current properties are located in industrial areas with histories of heavy industrial use 
the location of these properties may require us to incur environmental expenditures and to establish accruals for environmental liabilities that arise from causes other than our operations 
in addition  we are currently investigating and remediating contamination in connection with certain properties we have acquired 
future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their enforcement  new laws and regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to us  could result in material environmental or export compliance or remedial liabilities and costs  constrain our operations or make such operations more costly 
our international operations continue to expand  exposing us to additional risks 
our international presence has grown  so the risk of incurring liabilities or fines resulting from non compliance with various international laws and regulations has increased 
moreover  we are subject to the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa  and similar worldwide anti bribery laws in non us jurisdictions such as the uk anti bribery act  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from corruptly paying  offering to pay  or authorizing the payment of money  a gift  or anything of value  to a foreign official or foreign political party  for purposes of obtaining or retaining business 
a company can be held liable under these anti bribery laws not just for its own direct actions  but also for the actions of its foreign subsidiaries or other third parties  such as agents or distributors 
if we fail to comply with the requirements under these laws  we may face possible civil and or criminal penalties  which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results 
proposed legislation aimed at regulating and taxing carbon emissions may impact both the prices we pay for materials and the volume of business from our customers involved in fossil fuel exploration 
we purchase large quantities of metal from mills whose production costs may increase because of proposed increases in taxation on carbon emissions as a byproduct of the milling process 
such regulation  if passed  may result in significantly higher prices charged to us by the mills for most every type of metal that we sell 
the price that we pay for utilities such as electricity to run our warehouse equipment and fuel to run our delivery trucks and forklifts may rise as well due to increased taxation on the companies who produce and supply these commodities 
we may not be able to fully pass on these costs to our customers without a resulting decline in order volumes  which may adversely impact our profits 
carbon related regulation may also negatively impact domestic exploration efforts 
should such a reduction in domestic exploration occur  we would expect to see a resulting slowdown in sales to our energy end market in general  thus negatively impacting our revenues  gross profit and net income 
proposed regulation from the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act could adversely affect our business or financial results 
changes in regulatory requirements  such as proposed reporting requirements relating to conflict minerals originating in the democratic republic of congo drc or adjoining countries included in the dodd frank act  or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements  may result in increased compliance cost  capital expenditures and other financial obligations that could adversely affect our business or financial results 

table of contents our operating results have fluctuated  and are expected to continue fluctuating  depending on the season 
some of our customers are in seasonal businesses  including customers in the construction and related industries 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of increased vacation days and holiday closures for various customers 
consequently  you should not rely on our results of operations during any particular quarter as an indication of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
ongoing tax audits may result in additional taxes 
reliance and our subsidiaries are undergoing various tax audits 
these tax audits could result in additional taxes  plus interest and penalties being assessed against reliance or any of our subsidiaries and the amounts assessed could be material 
damage to our computer infrastructure and software systems could harm our business 
the unavailability of any of our primary information management systems for any significant period of time could have an adverse effect on our operations 
in particular  our ability to deliver products to our customers when needed  collect our receivables and manage inventory levels successfully largely depend on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems 
through information management systems  we provide inventory availability to our sales and operating personnel  improve customer service through better order and product reference data and monitor operating results 
difficulties associated with upgrades  installations of major software or hardware  and integration with new systems could lead to business interruptions that could harm our reputation  increase our operating costs and decrease our profitability 
in addition  these systems are vulnerable to  among other things  damage or interruption from power loss  computer system and network failures  loss of telecommunications services  operator negligence  physical and electronic loss of data  or security breaches and computer viruses 
we have contracted with third party service providers that provide us with backup systems in the event that our major information management systems are damaged 
the backup facilities and other protective measures we take could prove to be inadequate 
the value of your investment may be subject to sudden decreases due to the potential volatility of the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  including variations in our quarterly results of operations and our leverage position  as well as general economic conditions 
during the last four years our stock price was extremely volatile reaching an all time high of per share in july  declining to per share in november  and currently trading in the range in early other factors may include matters discussed in other risk factors and the following changes in expectations as to our future financial performance  including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors or changes in estimates that we provide in our quarterly earnings release and conference call  developments affecting our company  our customers or our suppliers  including general pricing announcements  changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting our business  press releases  earnings releases or publicity relating to us or our competitors or relating to trends in the metals service center industry  inability to meet securities analysts and investors quarterly or annual estimates or targets of our performance  
table of contents a decline in our credit rating by the rating agencies  damage to our corporate reputation  the operating and stock performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  including steel suppliers that face different hurdles than metals service centers  sales of our common stock by large shareholders or insiders  general domestic or international economic  market and political conditions 
these factors may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
in addition  stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
in the past  some shareholders have brought securities class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation  regardless of whether our defense is ultimately successful  could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
the volatility of the market could result in a material impairment of goodwill 
we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes in circumstances occur that might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances  indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill assets may not be recoverable  include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  declines in the market conditions of our products  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
principal shareholders who own a significant number of shares may have interests that conflict with yours 
periodically  we have one or more shareholders that control or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
individually or together  they may have the ability to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval 
in deciding how to vote on such matters  these shareholders may be influenced by interests that conflict with yours 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that may adversely impact your rights as a holder of reliance common stock 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and our bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring reliance  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock and the rights of our shareholders 
we are authorized to issue  shares of preferred stock  no par value  with the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such stock to be determined by our board of directors  without a vote of the holders of common stock 
our board of directors could grant rights to holders of preferred stock to reduce the attractiveness of reliance as a potential takeover target or make the removal of management more difficult 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at shareholder meetings 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors 
in addition  our credit facility and the provisions of our senior private notes and debt securities contain limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions 

table of contents risks related to our debt securities because our senior debt securities and the related guarantees are not secured and are effectively subordinated to the rights of secured creditors  the debt securities and the related guarantees will be subject to the prior claims of any secured creditors  and if a default occurs  we may not have sufficient funds to fulfill our obligations under the debt securities or the related guarantees 
the notes and the guarantees are unsecured obligations  ranking equally with other senior unsecured indebtedness 
the indenture governing the notes  as well as our credit facility and private placement notes  permit us and the subsidiary guarantors to incur additional secured or unsecured debt under specified circumstances 
if we or the subsidiary guarantors incur additional secured debt  our assets and the assets of the subsidiary guarantors securing such debt will be subject to prior claims by our secured creditors 
in the event of bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of either reliance or any of the subsidiary guarantors  assets that secure debt will be available to pay obligations on the notes and guarantees only after all debt secured by those assets has been repaid in full 
holders of the notes will participate in any remaining assets ratably with all of the respective unsecured and unsubordinated creditors of reliance and the subsidiary guarantors  including trade creditors 
if reliance or any of the subsidiary guarantors incurs any additional unsecured obligations that rank equally with the notes  including trade payables  the holders of those obligations will be entitled to share ratably with the holders of the notes in any proceeds distributed as a result of bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up 
if we do not have sufficient assets to pay all creditors of these entities  a portion of the notes outstanding would remain unpaid 
the guarantees may be unenforceable due to fraudulent conveyance statutes and  accordingly  the holders of our debt securities may not have a claim against the subsidiary guarantors 
the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee will be limited as necessary to prevent that guarantee from constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under applicable law 
however  a court in some jurisdictions could  under fraudulent conveyance laws  further subordinate or void the guarantee of any subsidiary guarantor if it found that such guarantee was incurred with actual intent to hinder  delay or defraud creditors  or such subsidiary guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee and that the subsidiary guarantor was any of the following insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the guarantee  engaged in a business or transaction for which its remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur  or believed that it would incur  debts beyond its ability to pay such debts at maturity 
if a court were to void the guarantee of a subsidiary guarantor as the result of a fraudulent conveyance  or hold it unenforceable for any other reason  holders of the notes would cease to have a claim against that subsidiary guarantor on its guarantee and would be creditors solely of reliance and any other subsidiary guarantor whose guarantee is not voided or held to be unenforceable 
the guarantees will be released under certain circumstances 
the debt securities will be guaranteed by any subsidiary guarantor for so long as such subsidiary guarantor is a borrower or a guarantor of obligations under our credit agreement and our private notes 
in the event that  for any reason  the obligations of any subsidiary guarantor terminate as a borrower or guarantor under our credit agreement and our private notes  that subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture and its guarantee of the notes will terminate 
a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will also terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture with respect to the notes of a series upon legal defeasance of such series or satisfaction and discharge of the indenture as it relates to such series 
a subsidiary guarantor s guarantee will also terminate and such subsidiary guarantor will be deemed released from all of its obligations under the indenture with respect to each series of notes in connection with any sale or 
table of contents other disposition by reliance of all of the capital stock of that subsidiary guarantor including by way of merger or consolidation or other transaction such that after giving effect to such transaction such subsidiary guarantor is no longer a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of reliance 
if the obligations of any subsidiary guarantor as a guarantor terminate or are released  the risks applicable to our subsidiaries that are not guarantors will also be applicable to such subsidiary guarantor 
we depend on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations under the notes 
claims of creditors of our subsidiaries may have priority over your claims with respect to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries 
we will therefore be dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our obligations under the notes and to meet our other obligations 
generally  creditors of our subsidiaries will have claims to the assets and earnings of our subsidiaries that are superior to the claims of our creditors  except to the extent the claims of our creditors are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the notes 
as of december   reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately billion  or  of our total consolidated assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately billion  or  of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  if reliance expands its international presence at a greater pace than it expands its us presence  a smaller percentage of its consolidated assets may be subject to the guarantee obligations 
in the event of the bankruptcy  insolvency  liquidation  reorganization  dissolution or other winding up of reliance  the holders of our notes may not receive any amounts with respect to the notes until after the payment in full of the claims of creditors of our subsidiaries that are not subsidiary guarantors 
we are permitted to incur more debt  which may intensify the risks associated with our current leverage  including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt 
subject to certain limitations  our existing credit facility and private notes permit us to incur additional debt 
the indenture governing the notes does not limit the amount of additional debt that we may incur 
if we incur additional debt  the risks associated with our leverage  including the risk that we will be unable to service our debt  will increase 
the provisions in the indenture that governs the notes relating to change of control transactions will not necessarily protect the holders of our notes in the event of a highly leveraged transaction 
the provisions contained in the indenture will not necessarily afford the holders of our notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction that may adversely affect them  including a reorganization  restructuring  merger or other similar transaction involving reliance 
these transactions may not involve a change in voting power or beneficial ownership or  even if they do  may not involve a change of the magnitude required under the definition of change of control repurchase event in the indenture to trigger these provisions  notably  that the transactions are accompanied or followed within days by a downgrade in the rating of the notes 
except in the event of a change of control  the indenture does not contain provisions that permit the holders of the notes to require us to repurchase the notes in the event of a takeover  recapitalization or similar transaction 
reliance may not be able to repurchase all of the notes upon a change of control repurchase event 
we will be required to offer to repurchase certain outstanding senior notes upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the indenture dated november  see exhibit included in this annual report on form k 
we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the notes

ratings of our notes may change and affect the market price and marketability of the notes 
the notes are rated by moody s investors service inc and standard poor s 
such ratings are limited in scope  and do not address all material risks relating to an investment in the notes  but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued and subsequently updated or affirmed 
an explanation of the significance of such rating may be obtained from such rating agency 
there is no assurance that our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that such ratings will not be lowered  suspended or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies  if  in each rating agency s judgment  circumstances so warrant 
it is also possible that such ratings may be lowered in connection with future events  such as future acquisitions 
holders of our notes have no recourse against us or any other parties in the event of a change in or suspension or withdrawal of such ratings 
any lowering  suspension or withdrawal of such ratings may have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the notes

the majority of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed 
for the remainder of our sales orders  we perform first stage processing  which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size 
because of this  the amount of related labor and overhead  including depreciation and amortization  are not significant and are excluded from our cost of sales 
therefore  our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the cost of the material we sell 
the company uses gross profit as shown above as a measure of operating performance 
gross profit is an important operating and financial measure  as fluctuations in gross profit can have a significant impact on our earnings 
gross profit  as presented  is not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies

includes the long term portion of capital lease obligations 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview overall  we were pleased with our performance in demand continued to improve slowly and steadily in many markets where we sell our products from the lows reached in our sales into the energy oil gas and agricultural and mining equipment industries grew the most for us in over sales into the aerospace  semiconductor electronics  and toll processing businesses mainly selling into the auto industry also remained solid for us in even non residential construction improved some over but significantly lagged compared to our sales into other markets  and this happens to be our most significant end market representing about of our sales 
overall however  demand is still well below pre recessionary levels 
our same store tons sold increased in over  and increased in over  but this was after a decline in from levels 
pricing followed a very similar pattern in as in with several price increases implemented by the mills for most products that we sell in the first four months of each of those years  followed by declining prices for the balance of the year 
in the fourth quarter significant price increases were announced  especially for carbon steel products  that maintained pricing in the fourth quarter and had strong momentum into the first quarter 
in the fourth quarter mills again announced price increases for certain products to be effective in the first quarter  however  there was less support for these pricing levels and the amounts were not as significant 
further  aluminum and stainless steel pricing was also weaker in the second half than in the second half 
this pricing volatility  along with mediocre demand created a competitive market and pressured our gross profit margins  with our gross profit margin at compared to in the year 
however  we continued to focus on cost control  resulting in net income of million  up from  on a increase in sales 
our sales of billion were our second best ever  our earnings per share were the fourth best  and we accomplished that with non residential construction  our largest market  still near recessionary low levels 
we have strong earnings capacity with our broad and diverse product base and wide geographic footprint that positions us well in our industry 
we also have significant exposure to industries that are poised for growth in the years ahead 
we will continue to focus on maximizing the profitability of our existing businesses and continued profitable growth through both acquisitions and internal initiatives 
in we acquired a specialty company servicing the energy market with approximately million of annual sales and in early we purchased a perforating company with annual sales of approximately million that will further complement our entry into that market 
we also spent million on capital expenditures in  our highest spend to date 
the majority of our capital expenditures related to growth initiatives  including the expansion and relocation of existing facilities  enhancing and adding processing capabilities  penetrating new geographic markets and expanding product offerings at existing locations 
our acquisition and internal growth initiatives further enhanced our product  geographic and customer diversity 
we believe this diversification makes our financial results less cyclical than others in our industry 
our balance sheet provides significant capacity for us to execute our growth strategies 
our net debt to total capital ratio was only at december  and we had million of borrowings outstanding on our billion credit facility 
from now through july  we have million of scheduled debt maturities 
we expect to fund these obligations  as well as our working capital  growth and other activities with our cash flow from operations and availability on our credit facility 
we expect to continue to grow the company in both through accretive acquisitions and internal growth opportunities that further enhance our product  geographic and customer diversity 
we expect to continue to see acquisition opportunities that are attractive to us 
we will evaluate these opportunities and 
table of contents pursue those that meet our disciplined acquisition criteria 
our capital expenditure budget is about million  a good portion of which will be invested in new or expanded facilities and state of the art equipment that will allow us to continue to provide superior customer service and the highest quality of processed metals to our existing customers as well as to expand our market share 
we believe the business climate will continue to improve slowly but steadily in the us and expect prices for metal products to remain somewhat volatile 
we will continue to focus on controlling costs and inventory turnover 
all of these factors lead us to believe that we will have improved financial results in as compared to  however  until there is significant improvement in demand  especially in the non residential construction market  we expect our results to be below what we believe our true earnings power is  given the current size and breadth of our company 
effect of demand and pricing changes on our operating results customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases our revenue dollars increase  which then contribute to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars  which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increase 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure other than for profit based compensation  the impact on our results of operations from changes in pricing is typically much greater than the effect of volume changes 
in addition  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this usually increases our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we typically generate stronger levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease and debt is reduced 
recent developments effective february   through our wholly owned subsidiary diamond manufacturing company  we acquired mckey perforating co  inc mckey  headquartered in new berlin  wisconsin and its subsidiary  mckey perforated products co  inc  located in manchester  tennessee 
mckey was founded in and is a contract manufacturer that provides a full range of metal perforating and fabrication services to customers located primarily in the us for the year ended december   mckey s unaudited net sales were approximately million 
the acquisition was funded with borrowings on our credit facility 
acquisition effective august   we acquired all the outstanding capital securities of continental alloys services  inc continental  headquartered in houston  texas  and certain affiliated companies 
continental is a leading global materials management company focused on high end steel and alloy pipe  tube and bar products and precision manufacturing of various tools designed for well completion programs of global energy service companies and has locations in seven countries including canada  malaysia  mexico  singapore  the uae  the united kingdom  and the united states 
this acquisition aligns well with the company s diversification strategy by increasing its exposure to the fast growing energy market  including the addition of oil country tubular goods octg products  new processing capabilities and 
table of contents entry into new international markets 
continental and its affiliates had combined net sales of approximately million in the five month period from august  through december  acquisitions on december   through our subsidiary american metals corporation  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of lampros steel  inc lsi and a related interest in lampros steel plate distribution  llc lspd 
lsi specializes in structural steel shapes with a facility located in portland  oregon 
lspd owned a interest in an unconsolidated partnership  lsi plate that is a distributor of carbon steel plate with locations in california and oregon 
net sales of lsi for the year ended december  were approximately million 
effective february  the business conducted by lsi plate was moved to lsi in order to achieve certain operational efficiencies 
on october   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of diamond consolidated industries  inc and affiliated companies diamond  which now operate under the corporate name diamond manufacturing company 
the operating divisions consist of diamond manufacturing company located in wyoming  pennsylvania and diamond manufacturing midwest in michigan city  indiana both of which specialize in the manufacture and sale of specialty engineered perforated materials  perforated metals plus  a distributor of perforated metals located in charlotte  north carolina  and dependable punch  a manufacturer of custom punches for tools and dies also located in wyoming  pennsylvania 
this acquisition expanded our product and processing offerings with the addition of perforated metals 
net sales of diamond for the year ended december  were approximately million 
an operating division of diamond was opened near dallas  texas in early to expand diamond s geographic reach 
internal growth activities as the economy steadily improved in  we maintained our focus on organic growth by opening new facilities  building or expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment with total capital expenditures of million  our highest to date 
this amount includes the purchase of three facilities that we previously leased  which will reduce our expenses 
our capital expenditure budget was million 
during we also consolidated and closed a few small operations that did not impact our ability to service our customers 
our capital expenditure budget is our highest ever  at approximately million with much of this related to internal growth activities comprised of expansions of existing facilities and purchases of equipment as well as establishing a presence in new geographic markets 
we also plan to move out of various leased facilities and into newly built and or purchased ones 
this reflects our confidence in our long term prospects  however  we will continue to evaluate and execute each growth project and consider the economic conditions and outlook at the time 
we estimate our maintenance capital expenditures at about million  which allows us to significantly reduce our capital expenditure spending if and when necessary 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years ended december dollars are shown in millions and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of net sales of net sales of net sales net sales cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense shown below gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense amortization expense operating income gross profit  calculated as net sales less cost of sales  and gross profit margin  calculated as gross profit divided by net sales  are non gaap financial measures as they exclude depreciation and amortization expense associated with the corresponding sales 
the majority of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed 
for the remainder of our sales orders  we perform first stage processing  which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size 
because of this  the amount of related labor and overhead  including depreciation and amortization  are not significant and are excluded from our cost of sales 
therefore  our cost of sales is primarily comprised of the cost of the material we sell 
the company uses gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance 
gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures  as fluctuations in our gross profit margin can have a significant impact on our earnings 
gross profit and gross profit margin  as presented  are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies

non residential construction  our largest end market  continues to be our weakest  however  we have seen some improvements in demand in for certain non residential construction related products in certain areas around the country 
as a result of increased mill prices  we were able to sell most products at higher average selling prices in compared to levels 
our major commodity selling prices increased in from levels as follows carbon steel up  aluminum up  stainless steel up  and alloy up 
the mill price increases over levels have primarily been due to rises in scrap and other input costs at the mills rather than improved end market demand

gross profit year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change gross profit we were able to generate higher gross profit dollars in due to overall higher average selling prices and demand for our products in compared to our gross profit margins  however  declined slightly from levels mainly due to increased pricing volatility in after experiencing significant price increases for most of our products through the first four months of  pricing began to decline and generally did not reverse its course until the end of the year  when the mills began announcing 
table of contents small price increases for many of our products to be effective in an environment of declining prices puts negative pressure on our gross profit margins as we may have to lower our selling prices prior to receiving the lower cost inventory on hand 
pricing volatility  especially when headed downward  also generally increases competition in our industry  which contributed to our lower gross profit margins in see also cost of sales above for discussion of our lifo reserve adjustments

in general  demand gradually improved in from our low reached in june as the general economy began its slow recovery and our customers bought metal to meet their production needs 
business activity in most all of our markets was better in than in  with the exception of non residential construction  which we believe represents about one third of our revenues 
our strongest markets during were in energy oil gas  semiconductor electronics  aerospace  and toll processing  which is primarily related to the auto and appliance industries 
our toll processing volumes in were up from levels 
most of the products we sell had higher average selling prices in compared to levels as a result of increased mill prices over the period 
our major commodity selling prices increased in from levels as follows carbon steel up  aluminum up  stainless steel up  and alloy up 
contributing to the increase in our overall average selling price of was also a shift in our product mix  with our carbon steel sales as a percent of total sales dollars declining to of total sales dollars in from in and stainless steel sales increasing to from 
as stainless steel products generally have higher prices than carbon steel products  this shift in our product mix increased our average price per ton sold 

table of contents furthermore  late in  significant price increases were announced by the domestic carbon steel mills due mainly to a rise in scrap and other input costs at the mills  as opposed to higher end use demand 
many of these increases were announced in december  which allowed us to pass through at least a portion of the increase to our customers and contributed to the increase in our fourth quarter and annual average selling price

the lifo credit  or income  resulted from significant declines in both cost and quantities of inventory on hand at the end of as compared to the beginning of that year 
our lifo reserve as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
gross profit year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change gross profit our gross profit margin was positively impacted due to our large lifo adjustment in that period resulting from falling metal prices 
in mid our inventory costs were better aligned with current replacement costs and demand and pricing had generally stabilized 
this allowed us to improve our fifo gross profit margins in the second half that  along with our lifo adjustment  resulted in a gross profit margin of 
our gross profit margin during the first half was relatively consistent with our rate 
although we were operating in a more stable environment during  our gross profit margin narrowed in the second half of the year  which resulted in a gross profit margin of 
the mills announced price reductions early in the third quarter and that  along with the higher cost inventory that we were receiving  pressured our selling prices  resulting in lower gross profit margins than we experienced earlier in late in the fourth quarter mills announced significant increases for certain carbon products  which positively impacted our gross profit margins in december see cost of sales above for discussion of our lifo reserve adjustments 

table of contents expenses year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change s  g a expense depreciation amortization expense our expenses as a percent of sales decreased because of our higher sales compared to increases in variable compensation expenses along with moderate increases in certain warehouse and delivery expenses  resulting from improved demand for our products as well as the s  g a expenses from our acquisitions account for most of the change in s  g a expenses during compared to our cost structure is highly variable  with personnel related expenses making up about of our s  g a expenses 
in  we reduced our headcount by over  employees or from year end levels 
total compensation related expenses in were lower because of these personnel reductions as well as reduced bonus  commission  and incentive compensation due to lower gross profit and pre tax income levels 
since employees throughout our workforce have a significant portion of compensation tied to profitability  the improvement in gross profit margins and pre tax profits in as compared to led to higher bonus  commission  and incentive compensation levels during as compared to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was mainly due to additional depreciation expense from our acquisitions and depreciation of our capital expenditures 
operating income year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change operating income the higher sales and gross profit amounts in offset by only moderate increases in s  g a expenses significantly improved our operating income in other income and expense interest expense in was million  a decrease of million from million in although we significantly increased our borrowings for the billion purchase of pna in august  we were able to quickly reduce our debt level because of our record cash flows during and continued positive cash flow in other expense income  net was a net other expense of million in compared to net other income of million in  a net decrease in income of million primarily due to lower income from company owned life insurance policies of million

table of contents net income year ended december  of net sales of net sales dollar change percentage change net income attributable to reliance the increase in net income was primarily the result of a more stable demand and pricing environment for our products  which allowed us to generate increased gross profit dollars with relatively smaller increases in our operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in our working capital  primarily accounts receivable and inventories  increased as a result of increased demand levels and higher mill prices from december  we were able to fund these increases with our profitable business activities and borrowings on our credit facility 
our receivables and fifo inventories increased by million and million  respectively  from december  levels  offset with increases in our accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million 
to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding and on our inventory turnover rate  as receivables and inventory are the two most significant elements of our working capital 
as of december  our days sales outstanding rate was approximately days  unchanged from december  our inventory turn rate based on dollars during was about times or months on hand  compared to our rate of times or months on hand 
our turns were impacted by the continental acquisition in august excluding continental  our inventory turn rate was times or months on hand 
investing activities capital expenditures were million in compared to million in the majority of our capital expenditures related to growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities  purchase properties that were previously leased and to add or upgrade equipment in addition to meeting ongoing maintenance requirements 
in we acquired continental for approximately million  net of cash acquired and debt assumed 
financing activities the increase in our working capital and capital expenditures during as well as the acquisition of continental was largely funded by our cash from operations and net borrowings of million on our credit facility 
we paid dividends to our shareholders of million in on february   our board of directors declared the first quarter regular cash dividend of per share of common stock  an increase of from per share 
we have paid regular quarterly dividends to our shareholders for consecutive years 
liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are our internally generated funds from operations and our billion revolving credit facility 
our total outstanding debt at december  was billion  up from million at december  at december   we had million in outstanding borrowings on our billion revolving credit facility 

table of contents on july   we amended and restated our existing syndicated credit agreement to increase the borrowing limit from billion to billion  and to extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility for a five year term to july  the amended and restated revolving credit facility has banks as lenders 
interest on borrowings from the amended and restated revolving credit facility is at variable rates based on libor plus or the bank prime rate plus as of december  the amended and restated revolving credit facility includes a commitment fee on the unused portion  at an annual rate of as of december  the applicable margin over libor rate and base rate borrowings  along with commitment fees  are subject to adjustment every quarter based on the company s leverage ratio  as defined 
we also have various other separate revolving credit facilities with a combined credit limit of approximately million that are in place for operations in asia and europe as of december  these revolving credit facilities had a combined outstanding balance of million as of december  and capital resources on november   we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations of reliance and rank equally with all other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations of reliance 
the senior unsecured notes include provisions that  in the event of a change in control and a downgrade of our credit rating  require us to make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to of their principal amount plus accrued interest 
at december   we also had million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and have a remaining life of years  maturing in july our net debt to total capital ratio was at december   up from december  rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by reliance shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
as of december   we had million of debt obligations coming due before our billion revolving credit facility expires july  we are comfortable that we will have adequate cash flow and capacity on our revolving credit facility to fund our debt obligations as well as our working capital  capital expenditure  growth and other needs 
we expect to continue our acquisition and other growth activities and anticipate that we will be able to fund such activities with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
covenants the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the senior unsecured note agreements collectively require us to maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio and include a change of control provision  among other things 
our interest coverage ratio for the twelve month period ended december  was approximately times compared to the debt covenant minimum requirement of times interest coverage ratio is calculated as net income attributable to reliance plus interest expense and provision for income taxes and plus or minus any non operating non recurring loss or gain  respectively  divided by interest expense 
our leverage ratio as of december  calculated in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility was compared to the financial covenant maximum amount of leverage ratio is calculated as total debt  inclusive of capital lease obligations and outstanding letters of credit  divided by reliance shareholders 
table of contents equity plus total debt 
the minimum net worth requirement as of december  was billion compared to reliance shareholders equity balance of billion as of december  additionally  all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  which constitute the substantial majority of our subsidiaries  guarantee the borrowings under the revolving credit facility  the indenture and the private placement notes 
the subsidiary guarantors  together with reliance  are required collectively to account for at least of our consolidated ebitda and of consolidated tangible assets 
reliance and the subsidiary guarantors accounted for approximately of our total consolidated ebitda for the last twelve months and approximately of total consolidated tangible assets as of december  we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december  and  we were contingently liable under standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million and million  respectively 
the letters of credit related to insurance policies  construction projects  and outstanding bonds 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under us generally accepted accounting principles 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt obligations estimated interest on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total interest is estimated using applicable rates as of december  for our outstanding fixed and variable rate debt based on their respective scheduled maturities 
also  the entire outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility of million is assumed to remain unchanged until its maturity date in july the majority of our inventory purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace related materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments for the next ten years for various long term retirement plans 
for qualified defined benefit plans we have only included the estimated employer contribution amounts for as funding projections beyond are not practical to estimate 
we have excluded deferred income taxes of million  long term tax contingencies of million and other long term liabilities of million from the amounts presented  as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain 

table of contents contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace related materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  pricing in effect at that time for inventory purchase commitments  or due to changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers are in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry and related businesses 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired  amounted to billion as of december   or approximately of total assets or of reliance shareholders equity 
additionally  other intangible assets  net amounted to million at december   or approximately of total assets or of reliance shareholders equity 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
refer to critical accounting policies and estimates for further discussion regarding judgments involved in testing for recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discuss our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make 
table of contents subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectability of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues such as bankruptcy status  our past collection history  and current financial and credit agency reports along with current economic pressures impacting that customer or industry 
accounts that we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and probable future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories a significant portion of our inventory is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
under this method  older costs are included in inventory  which may be higher or lower than current costs 
this method of valuation is subject to year to year fluctuations in our cost of material sold  which is influenced by the inflation or deflation existing within the metals industry as well as fluctuations in our product mix and on hand inventory levels 
at december   cost on the first in  first out fifo method exceeded our lifo value of inventories by million 
the calculation of lifo does not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments  except at interim reporting periods 
furthermore  considering that our current inventory values as reflected in our financial statements on a lifo basis are significantly below fifo costs  valuation of our inventories at the lower of cost or market is also not subject to significant estimates or judgments 
however  we do maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 

table of contents for information regarding our deferred tax assets and liabilities  provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities  among others 
long lived assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we review the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives annually or whenever significant events or changes occur  which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
factors that may be considered a change in circumstances  indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets may not be recoverable  include a decline in stock price and market capitalization  declines in the market conditions of our products  reduced future cash flow estimates  and slower growth rates in our industry  among others 
we review the recoverability of our intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives by making assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method  as necessary 
in calculating the fair value of a reporting unit  the fair value of that reporting unit is estimated based on expected future economic benefits discounted to a present value at a rate of return commensurate with the risk associated with the investment 
projected cash flows are discounted to present value using an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considers both returns to equity and debt investors 
we perform the required annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment evaluation as of november of each year 
no impairment of goodwill was determined to exist for the years ended december   or impairment assessment inherently involves judgment as to assumptions about expected future cash flows and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions 
future events and the current changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to commodity prices  demand and future growth rates or other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of future cash flows 
although we believe the assumptions used in testing for impairment are reasonable  significant changes in any one of our assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
additionally  considerable declines in the market conditions for our products from current levels as well as in the price of our common stock could also significantly impact our impairment analysis 
an impairment charge  if incurred  could be material 
long lived assets other we review the recoverability of our other lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impact of recently issued accounting standards please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the impact of recently issued accounting standards 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
this strategy also limits our exposure to commodity prices to our inventories on hand 
in an environment of increasing material costs our pricing usually increases as we try to maintain the same gross profit percentage and typically generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars for the same operational efforts 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
in periods where demand deteriorates rapidly and metal prices are declining significantly in a compressed period of time  a portion of our inventory on hand may be at higher costs than our selling prices  causing a significant adverse effect on our gross profit and pre tax income margins 
however  when prices stabilize and our inventories on hand reflect more current prices  our gross profit margins tend to return to more normalized levels 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
the currency effects of translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries  which operate in local currency environments  are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss income component of consolidated equity and do not impact earnings unless there is a liquidation or sale of those foreign subsidiaries 
we do not hedge our net investments in foreign subsidiaries due to the long term nature of those investments 
total foreign currency transaction gains and losses impacting earnings were as follows million of losses in and million of gains in and during  our primary exposure to foreign currency rates that impacted our earnings related to certain outstanding intercompany balances with our canadian operations that were not hedged 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pre tax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
as of december   our total variable interest rate debt outstanding amounted to approximately million  which was primarily comprised of the borrowings on our revolving credit facility of million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates on million of debt would result in approximately million of additional interest expense on an annual basis
