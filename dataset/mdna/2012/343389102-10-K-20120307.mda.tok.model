rig counts are the annual average of the reported weekly rig count activity 
gas prices are the annual average of the monthly average natural gas price 
customers exploration and production budgets  in many instances  depend upon the revenue generated from the sale of oil and natural gas 
lower oil and natural gas prices usually translate into lower exploration and production budgets 
the opposite is true for higher oil and natural gas prices 
crude oil prices were relatively stable for most of beginning with the latter part of and throughout the first six months of oil prices rose dramatically  becoming increasingly volatile in the second half of due to ongoing concerns regarding global economic recovery 
our current outlook forecasts continued oil price upward price pressure due to supply uncertainty offset by uncertainties of economic growth 
natural gas drilling activity continues to be curtailed with natural gas working inventories at the end of december totaling  billion cubic feet bcf  approximately  or bcf  above the ending december levels of  bcf 
in  the average monthly us natural gas wellhead price of mcf remained depressed compared to historic highs and is expected to remain so throughout primarily due to record high natural gas inventories reported for the fourth quarter of depressed natural gas prices  increased shale gas production levels and unusually warm north american winter temperatures contributed to the increased natural gas storage levels 
the company anticipates the rate of growth in natural gas production will continue in  albeit at a slower growth rate than  along with increased storage levels 
despite this and heightened geopolitical uncertainties  the company believes that  over the long term  any major macroeconomic disruptions will ultimately correct themselves as the underlying trends of significant demand growth within developing countries  smaller and more complex reservoir activity  high depletion rates  and the need for continual reserve replacement support the company s on going strategic expansion initiatives with patented complex nano fluid micro emulsifier chemistries and with increased domestic and international market penetration 
the accelerated shift in the latter part of from natural gas to oil and liquids rich shale 
table of contents basins has resulted in increased product and service demands as well as increased patented complex nano fluid chemistry and other technological reliance designed to promote efficiency within complex reservoirs 
this trend continued throughout  with horizontal oil directed drilling activity being the fastest growing segment of the market 
while total worldwide rig count increased from december  to december   horizontal directed rig activity  which is representative of over of total north american rigs  is approximately higher than horizontal rig count peak levels attained in these trends have led to increased demand and improved pricing across a significant portion of the company s products and services 
increased economic activity  particularly in the emerging middle eastern and asian markets  combined with market predictions of continued economic growth within north american markets  remains supportive of a continued increase in demand for oil and stable natural gas 
spending by oil and natural gas exploration and production e p companies is heavily influenced by expectations of future supply and forecast demand for oil and natural gas products  as well as forecast costs to find  develop and produce reserves 
changes in oil and natural gas exploration and production spending resulted in record demand for the company s products and services for as compared to despite the shift from natural gas to liquids rich natural gas drilling  spending on natural gas directed projects is supported by hedges on prior period production transacted when futures prices were higher  the need to drill and produce natural gas wells to hold leases acquired in earlier periods  the influx of equity from companies interested in penetration and development of shale resource plays  and associated production of natural gas liquids in certain basins 
further  e p companies have improved discovery and production techniques to the point that despite current relatively depressed natural gas prices  drilling for natural gas continues to be economically viable for our customers 
the company anticipates current economic conditions will continue throughout the first half of despite the market and economic uncertainties noted above 
the company remains cognizant that if further unfavorable economic conditions occur  the company could be impacted by additional drilling activity uncertainty 
going forward the company believes current activity will ensure margin sustainability  but anticipates that growing cost pressures could mitigate forecast margin improvements in as the outlook for e p companies improves with favorable expectations of liquid rich natural gas and crude oil prices  we remain optimistic that our customer s capital budgets for drilling and completion activities will continue to hold and possibly strengthen 
the company expects that north american gas market activity will remain relatively stable in unconventional plays such as the barnett  marcellus and other basins that utilize the company s products and services 
additionally  growing recognition of the beneficial use and corresponding increase in demand for the company s patented  environmentally friendly green complex nano fluid micro emulsifiers is expected to continue 
product demand  driven by forecast market share growth  continues to trend favorably 
the company intends to continue to pursue strategic international initiatives and opportunities through and beyond
