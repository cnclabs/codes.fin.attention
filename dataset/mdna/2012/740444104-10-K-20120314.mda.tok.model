each segment distributes a full range of our primary products

our other three segments  the americas  emea and asia pacific  support our energy  telecommunications and data communication products in each respective geographical region 
the segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the company s chief executive officer  who is the chief operating decision maker  and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible 
the business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment 
we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income 
the segment information for the prior period has been recast to conform to the current segment presentation 
we acquired electropar limited on july  pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired all of the equity outstanding of electropar for nz million or million  net of a customary post closing working capital adjustment of 
million 
electropar designs  manufactures and markets pole line and substation hardware for the global electrical utility industry 
electropar is based in new zealand with a subsidiary operation in australia 
we believe that the acquisition of electropar has and will continue to strengthen our position in the power distribution  transmission and substation hardware markets and expand our presence in the asia pacific region 
on december   the company and tyco electronics group sa tyco electronics completed a stock and asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which we acquired from tyco electronics its dulmison business for million and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the acquisition of dulmison strengthened our position in the power distribution and transmission hardware market and expanded our presence in the asia pacific region 
as a result of the acquisition  we added operations in indonesia and malaysia and strengthened our existing positions in australia  thailand  mexico and the united states 
market overview our business continues to be concentrated in the energy and communications markets 
during the past several years  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in our major markets 
this trend is expected to continue in the sluggish global economy coupled with a depressed us housing market has and could continue to affect construction projects and negatively impact growth opportunities in our core markets in the us and countries such as spain  poland and great britain where the financial situation is expected to be similar going forward 
in  we again experienced growth in our energy market 
we continued to see the investment in renewable energy projects  new transmission grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure 
we expect the distribution energy market to be relatively flat in but anticipate continued growth in demand for transmission and fiber optic products 
we believe that the acquisitions of dulmison from tyco electronics in december and electropar in july have further contributed to our leadership position and will enable us to enhance the scope of our product lines and the technology we provide to this important market 
the spacer  spacer damper and stockbridge damper product lines fit well and complement our product offerings and enable us to offer the most comprehensive line of products in the industry 
we further strengthened our overall presence in the asia pacific region with the acquisition of electropar in auckland  new zealand 
electropar is a manufacturer of substation  distribution and transmission products supplying both the australian and new zealand electricity markets 
with demand for electrical power continuing to increase  especially in many fast growing areas of the world  we believe that our leadership position in the market will enable us to take advantage of prospects for continued growth as the transmission grid is enhanced and extended 
our international business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our international sales were primarily related to the distribution portion of the energy market but have grown through acquisition and new product development to include a significant contribution from the transmission market 
we believe that we are well positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies 
our communication business in continued to face challenges throughout the world 
many communications customers cut back on capital and operational spending as the global economic downturn negatively impacted consumer spending on communication services 
the broadband stimulus program that was announced early in finally gained some traction and we were in a strong position to secure opportunities that this funding provided 
we continue to intensely focus on the customer and put resources towards new product development efforts 
these efforts were directed at customer premise and demarcation applications which are the final connections between the network and the end consumer 
as economic conditions improve and stimulus funds continue to flow into projects  we believe our efforts in these areas will lead to growth in our communications business 
opportunities for growth also look promising internationally where deployment of fixed line telecommunications services and broadband penetration rates remain low as a percentage of the total population

working capital  liquidity and capital resources management assessment of liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operating funding needs  fund additional investments  including acquisitions  and make dividend payments to shareholders 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  cash dividends  business acquisitions and access to bank lines of credit 
our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives 
in  we used cash of million for capital expenditures 
we ended the fourth quarter of with million of cash and cash equivalents 
the company has adequate sources of liquidity and we believe we have the ability to generate cash to meet existing or reasonably likely future cash requirements 
our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world 
at december   the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside the us we expect accumulated us cash balances will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows  use of us cash balances  external borrowings  or some combination of these sources 
we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk 
we closely monitor payments and developments which may signal possible customer credit issues 
we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity from customer credit issues 
our financial position remains strong and our current ratio at december  was to compared to to at december  at december   our unused availability under our line of credit was million and our bank debt to equity percentage was 
the line of credit agreement contains  among other provisions  requirements for maintaining levels of working capital  net worth and profitability 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we expect that our major source of funding for and beyond will be our operating cash flows  our existing cash and cash equivalents as well as our revolving credit agreement 
we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our borrowing capacity provides substantial financial resources if needed to supplement funding of capital expenditures and or acquisitions 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition 
sources and uses of cash cash increased million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the major investing and financing uses of cash were capital expenditures of million  dividends of million  and common share repurchases of million partially offset by net debt borrowings of million

in july  we purchased electropar for nz million or million  including cash acquired of

one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through december under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk to make up a deficiency from market value attributable to damage  extraordinary wear and tear  excess air hours or exceeding maintenance overhaul schedules required by the federal aviation administration 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be small because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments are summarized in the following tables september  september  september  september  september  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years thousands of dollars notes payable to bank a long term debt b capital leases operating leases purchase commitments acquisition related obligations c pension contribution and other retirement plans d income taxes payable  non current e september  september  september  september  september  amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total less than year years years after years thousands of dollars letters of credit guarantees a interest on short term debt is included in the table at interest rates of to in effect at december  b interest on long term debt is included in the table at interest rates from 
to based on the variable interest rates in effect at december  c as part of the purchase agreement to acquire electropar  the company has finalized the additional earn out consideration payment based on electropar achieving a financial performance target earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization over the months ending july  the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement was determined by estimating the expected probability weighted earn out payment discounted to present value  which included increases in net present value due to the passage of time 
d amount represents the expected contribution to the company s defined benefit pension plan in future expected amounts beyond one year have not been disclosed as such amounts are subject to change based on performance of the assets in the plan as well as the discount rate used to determine the obligation 
at december   the company s unfunded contractual obligation was million 
the company s supplemental profit sharing plan accrued liability at december  was million 
e as of december   there were million of tax liabilities  including interest and penalties  related to unrecognized tax benefits 
because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  if any  the company is unable to estimate the years in which cash settlement may occur with the respective tax authorities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
sales recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition 
we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped  with no right of return  or when they are delivered based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue related to shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold 
receivable allowances allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents approximately of our trade receivables at december  and reserve for credit memos we maintain an allowance for future sales credits related to sales recorded during the year 
our estimated allowance is based on historical sales credits issued in the subsequent year related to the prior year and any significant preapproved open return good authorizations as of the balance sheet date 
our allowance is updated on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for credit memos represents less than of our trade receivables at december  and of our trade receivables at december  excess and obsolescence reserves we provide excess and obsolescence reserves to state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
we identify inventory items which have had no usage or are in excess of the usages over the historical to months 
a management team with representatives from marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance reviews these inventory items  determines the disposition of the inventory and assesses the estimated market value based on their knowledge of the product and market conditions 
these conditions include  among other things  future demand for product  product utility  unique customer order patterns or unique raw material purchase patterns  changes in customer and quality issues 
at december  and  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was of gross inventory 
if the impact of market conditions deteriorates from those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill has been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
our measurement date for our annual impairment test is october of each year 
previously we performed our annual impairment testing of goodwill as of january since the adoption of the applicable guidance  now codified in asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
during the quarter ended december   we voluntarily changed the date of our annual goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test from the first day of the first quarter january to the first day of the fourth quarter october 
we determined that this change is preferable under the circumstances as it better aligns with our annual business planning and budgeting process and provides us with additional time to prepare and complete the impairment test  including measurement of any indicated impairment  as necessary  prior to issuance of the year end financial statements 
this voluntary change in accounting principle was not made to delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
this change is not applied retrospectively as it is impracticable to do so because retrospective application would require the application of significant estimates and assumptions with the use of hindsight 
accordingly  the change will be applied prospectively 
we performed our annual impairment tests for goodwill as of january  and october   and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value was required 
there were no trigger events during and as such  only the annual impairment tests were performed 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we establish a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions we identify tax positions taken on the federal  state  local and foreign income tax returns filed or to be filed 
a tax position can include a reduction in taxable income reported in a previously filed tax return or expected to be reported on a future tax return that impacts the measurement of current or deferred income tax assets or liabilities in the period being reported  a decision not to file a tax return  an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions  the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return  or a decision to classify a transaction  entity or other position in a tax return as tax exempt 
we determine whether a tax position is an uncertain or a routine business transaction tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained at the full amount upon examination 
under fasb asc formerly fin  tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce our current or future income tax liability  are reported in our financial statements only to the extent that each benefit was recognized and measured under a two step approach 
the first step requires us to assess whether each tax position based on its technical merits and facts and circumstances as of the reporting date  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step measures the amount of tax benefit that we recognize in the financial statements  based on a cumulative probability approach 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold that is not highly certain is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority  assuming that the tax authority has examined the position and has full knowledge of all relevant information 
fasb asc requires subjectivity of judgments to identify outcomes and to assign probability in order to estimate the settlement amount 
we provide estimates in order to determine settlement amounts 
during the year ended december   we did not recognize a benefit for uncertain tax positions 
at december   the total reserve for uncertain tax positions is million 
pensions we record obligations and expenses related to pension benefit plans based on actuarial valuations  which include key assumptions on discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and compensation increases 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the discount rate of at december  reflects an analysis of yield curves as of the end of the year and the schedule of expected cash needs of the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets of reflects the plan s historical returns and represents our best estimate of the likely future returns on the plan s asset mix 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience  market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries 
however  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost  while a decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  an increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease the net periodic pension cost  while a decrease in expected long term return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards updates asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu addresses the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple products or services by revising the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is necessary to separately account for each product or service 
this hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance 
asu is required to be applied prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements beginning on or after january  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations 
the objective of asu is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity as defined by fasb asc that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill other 
the amendments in asu affect all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the amendments in asu modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we adopted asu effective january  and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
recently issued accounting pronouncements changes to gaap are established by the fasb in the form of asu s to the fasb s asc 
we consider the applicability and impact of all asu s 
asu s not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued asu which provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test for goodwill impairment 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
the revised standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december  however  an entity can choose to early adopt even if its annual test date is before the issuance of the final standard  provided that the entity has not yet performed its annual impairment test or issued its financial statements 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrss to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that fair value measurements and disclosure requirements are similar between gaap and ifrs 
this guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
the amendments in this asu are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and are applied prospectively 
early application by public entities is not permitted 
we do not expect adoption of asu will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows or disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 presentation of comprehensive income asu 
the amendments in asu allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both instances  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
however  in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu  which deferred the guidance on whether to require entities to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement where net income is presented and the statement where other comprehensive income is presented for both interim and annual financial statements 
asu reinstated the requirements for the presentation of reclassifications that were in place prior to the issuance of asu and did not change the effective date for asu for public entities  the amendments in asu and asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and should be applied retrospectively 
the adoption of this guidance concerns disclosure only and will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the company s global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to the company s international operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which the company s largest international operations are located 
as of december   the company had one immaterial foreign currency forward exchange contract outstanding 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt  intercompany debt  forward exchange contracts  foreign denominated receivables and cash and short term investments 
a hypothetical change in currency rates would have a favorable unfavorable impact on fair values of million and on income before tax of less than 
million
