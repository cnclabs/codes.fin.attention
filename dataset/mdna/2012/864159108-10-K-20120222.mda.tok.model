item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview sturm  ruger company  inc the company is principally engaged in the design  manufacture  and sale of firearms to domestic customers 
approximately of the company s total sales for were firearms sales  and was investment castings sales 
export sales represent approximately of total sales 
the company s design and manufacturing operations are located in the united states and almost all product content is domestic 
the company s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors  principally to the commercial sporting market 
the company also manufactures investment castings made from steel alloys for internal use in its firearms and utilizes excess investment casting capacity to manufacture and sell castings to unaffiliated  third party customers 
orders of many models of firearms from the independent distributors tend to be stronger in the first quarter of the year and weaker in the third quarter of the year 
this is due in part to the timing of the distributor show season  which occurs during the first quarter 
results of operations product demand the estimated sell through of the company s products from distributors to retailers in increased from during this period  national instant criminal background check system nics background checks as adjusted by the national shooting sports foundation increased 
we believe the year over year increase in estimated sell through from distributors to retailers from is due to the following the strong demand for the new products launched in  including the new lc pistol  the sr pistol  the src pistol  the gunsite scout rifle  the single ten revolver  and the sp double action revolver chambered in lr 
new product introductions remain a strong driver of demand and represented million or of sales in the ruger american rifle and the sr pistol were introduced during the latter part of the fourth quarter and did not have a significant impact in sales  strong demand for certain mature products  and increased manufacturing capacity and greater product availability for certain products in strong demand 
estimated sell through from distributors to retailers and total nics background checks follow estimated units sold from distributors to retailers total adjusted nics background checks thousands the estimates for each period were calculated by taking the beginning inventory at the distributors  plus shipments from the company to distributors during the period  less the ending inventory at distributors 
these estimates are only a proxy for actual market demand as they rely on data provided by independent distributors that are not verified by the company  do not consider potential timing issues within the distribution channel  including goods in transit  and do not consider fluctuations in inventory at retail 
while nics background checks are not a precise measure of retail activity  they are commonly used as a proxy for retail demand 
nics background checks are performed when the ownership of most firearms  either new or used  is transferred by a federal firearms licensee 
nics background checks are also performed for permit applications  permit renewals  and other administrative reasons 
the adjusted nics data presented above was derived by the national shooting sports foundation nssf by subtracting out nics checks that are not directly related to the sale of a firearm  including checks used for concealed carry ccw permit application checks as well as checks on active ccw permit databases 
while not a direct correlation to firearms sales  the nssf adjusted nics data provides a more accurate picture of current market conditions than raw nics data 
orders received and ending backlog in millions except average sales price  net of federal excise tax orders received average sales price of orders received ending backlog average sales price of ending backlog the increase in orders received and the increase in the ending backlog in are due primarily to strong for demand new products  including the ruger american rifle and the sr pistol which were introduced in the latter part of the fourth quarter of  and certain mature products 
production total unit production in increased from the increased production was due in part to the company s previously disclosed strategy of changing production rates less frequently in in a more deliberate effort to level load production throughout the year 
the intention of this planned change in production volumes was to build finished goods inventory during the period when we expect lesser demand typically the third quarter and the first half of the fourth quarter so that we have more finished goods inventory available to ship during the period when we expect greater demand typically the end of the fourth quarter and the first quarter 
the annual output of our manufacturing plants in did increase under this plan which  in turn  allowed us to better capitalize on sales opportunities  particularly during the fourth quarter 
the company continues to further implement lean manufacturing principles across its facilities 
this ongoing process began in  and includes the following current initiatives transitioning from batch production to single piece flow manufacturing  refining existing cells and  where practical  consolidating smaller cells into value stream super cells  developing pull systems and managing vendors  increasing capacity for the products with the greatest unmet demand  and re engineering mature product designs for improved manufacturability 
the company is transitioning to a new enterprise resource planning system and converted one of its manufacturing facilities and a portion of its support functions  including sales and finance during the company expects to have the new system fully implemented by the end of annual summary unit data firearms unit data for orders  production  shipments and backorders follows units ordered units produced units shipped average sales price units on backorder inventories the company s finished goods inventory decreased  units during and remains significantly below what the company believes to be optimal levels to support rapid fulfillment of distributor demand 
the company expects to replenish its finished goods inventory in future periods to levels that will better serve its customers 
this replenishment could increase the fifo value of finished goods inventory by as much as million from the current level upon the attainment of the desired levels of finished goods inventory 
distributor inventories of the company s products increased  units during and are closer to the levels the company believes are needed to support rapid fulfillment of retailer demand 
if the independent distributors attempt to increase their inventory turns  future increases to distributor inventories of the company s products may occur at a slower rate than  or distributor inventories of the company s products could decrease 
distributor investments in other manufacturers products  some of which may not be turning as fast as the company s products turn  may further impede this inventory replenishment

product demand the estimated sell through of the company s products from distributors to retailers in increased from during this period  national instant criminal background check system nics background checks as adjusted by the national shooting sports foundation decreased 
we believe the year over year increase in estimated sell through from distributors to retailers from is likely due to the following factors increased demand for handguns  the company s commitment to new product development which yielded several new product launches in which generated continued demand  and increased manufacturing capacity for certain products in strong demand 
estimated sell through from distributors to retailers and total nics background checks follow estimated units sold from distributors to retailers total adjusted nics background checks thousands the estimates for each period were calculated by taking the beginning inventory at the distributors  plus shipments from the company to distributors during the period  less the ending inventory at distributors

the company launched the src compact pistol  the lcr revolver  and the sr striker fired pistol in new product introductions  including the aforementioned products  remain a strong driver of demand and represented million or of sales in the decrease in orders received and the ending backlog in is due to the strong retail demand that began in late and resulted in large orders from distributors in the backlog was higher than normal for most of the average sales price of orders received and ending backlog in decreased from due to significant orders in for certain higher priced rifles  including the sr production after three years of increased production  the company intentionally reduced its output in by compared to while closely monitoring its finished goods inventory growth and distributor sell through to retailers 
production of certain products was limited to rates moderately in excess of estimated retail demand for those products  to allow for only modest increased finished goods inventory levels for those products 
the company continues to further implement lean manufacturing principles across its facilities

during the third quarter of  the company unilaterally cancelled all of the unshipped orders for mini and mini thirty autoloading rifles  and asked the distributors to submit new orders that better represented their forecasted needs 
the cancellation of these unshipped orders  partially offset by the submission of new orders for these products  resulted in a net reduction to the backlog of approximately  units or million

operations cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided in compared to is attributable to increased profitability in and increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities in  due in part to greater accruals for sales promotions and excise tax payments 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to was attributable to a greater reduction in inventory in  an increase in employee benefits and compensation in  and an increase in accounts receivable in third parties supply the company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings  such as fabricated steel components  walnut  birch  beech  maple and laminated lumber for rifle stocks  wax  ceramic material  metal alloys  various synthetic products and other component parts 
there is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time  which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors 
the company believes that it has adequate quantities of raw materials in inventory to provide sufficient time to locate and obtain additional items at then current market cost without interruption of its manufacturing operations 
however  if market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials can not be obtained  the company s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

during the second quarter of  the company made a  minority investment in a pepper spray company for which it received a interest 
this investment is included in other assets on the balance sheet 
the company has migrated its retirement benefits from defined benefit pension plans to defined contribution retirement plans  utilizing its current k plan 
in  the company amended its hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans so that employees no longer accrue benefits under them effective december  this action froze the benefits for all employees and prevented future hires from joining the plans  effective december  currently  the company provides supplemental discretionary contributions to substantially all employees individual k accounts 
minimum cash contributions of million were required for the defined benefit plans for the company contributed million to the defined benefit plans in both and in future years  the company may again be required to make cash contributions to the two defined benefit pension plans 
the annual contributions will be based on the amount of the unfunded plan liabilities derived from the frozen benefits and will not include liabilities for any future accrued benefits for any new or existing participants 
the total amount of these future cash contributions will depend on the investment returns generated by the plans assets and the then applicable discount rates used to calculate the plans liabilities 
the company plans to contribute approximately million in  but will increase the amount of the contribution if required to do so 
the intent of these contributions is to reduce the amount of time that the company will be required to continue to operate the frozen plans 
the ongoing cost of running the plans even if frozen is approximately  per year  which includes pbgc premiums  actuary and audit fees  and other expenses 
based on its unencumbered assets  the company believes it has the ability to raise substantial amounts of cash through issuance of short term or long term debt 
the company s unsecured million credit facility  which expires on june   remains unused and the company has no debt 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods

certain of the company s purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services that may not necessarily be enforceable or legally binding on the company  are also included in purchase obligations in the table 
certain of the company s purchase orders or contracts therefore included in the table may represent authorizations to purchase rather than legally binding agreements 
the company expects to fund all of these commitments with cash flows from operations and current cash and short terms investments

the company expects to realize its deferred tax assets through tax deductions against future taxable income 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and net sales and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
the company bases estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances  and other assumptions  including those reviewed with actuarial consultants and independent counsel  when applicable  that are believed to be reasonable 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the determination of its product liability accrual is a critical accounting policy 
the company s management reviews every lawsuit and claim and is in contact with independent and corporate counsel on an ongoing basis 
the provision for product liability claims is based upon many factors  which vary for each case 
these factors include the type of claim  nature and extent of injuries  historical settlement ranges  jurisdiction where filed  and advice of counsel 
an accrual is established for each lawsuit and claim  when appropriate  based on the nature of each such lawsuit or claim 
amounts are charged to product liability expense in the period in which the company becomes aware that a claim or  in some instances a threat of claim  has been made when potential losses or costs of defense are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
such amounts are determined based on the company s experience in defending similar claims 
occasionally  charges are made for claims made in prior periods because the cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  exceed amounts already provided 
likewise  credits may be taken if cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  are less than amounts previously provided 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with independent and corporate counsel  it is not reasonably possible that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period 
the company believes the valuation of its inventory and the related excess and obsolescence reserve is also a critical accounting policy 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost  principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and prevailing inventory costs existing at that time 
the company determines its excess and obsolescence reserve by projecting the year in which inventory will be consumed into a finished product 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  it does not seem prudent nor supportable to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
forward looking statements and projections the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements and projections concerning future expectations 
such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties  such as market demand  sales levels of firearms  anticipated castings sales and earnings  the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures  the results of pending litigation against the company  the impact of future firearms control and environmental legislation and accounting estimates  any one or more of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
words such as expect  believe  anticipate  intend  estimate  will  should  could and other words and terms of similar meaning  typically identify such forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date such forward looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of subsequent unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changing interest rates on its investments  which consist primarily of united states treasury instruments with short term less than one year maturities and cash 
the interest rate market risk implicit in the company s investments at any given time is low  as the investments mature within short periods and the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash 
the company has not undertaken any actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical basis point change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical basis point change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investments
