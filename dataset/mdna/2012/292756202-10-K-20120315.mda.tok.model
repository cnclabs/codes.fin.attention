item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of energysolutions included elsewhere in this 
table of contents annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  that are based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  and that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of a broad range of nuclear services to government and commercial customers who rely on our expertise to address their needs throughout the lifecycle of their nuclear operations 
our broad range of nuclear services includes engineering  in plant support services  spent nuclear fuel management  decontamination and decommissioning d d services  operation of nuclear reactors  logistics  transportation  processing  and llrw disposal 
we derive almost of our revenue from the provision of nuclear services 
we provide our services through two customer groups the government group and the global commercial group 
within the global commercial group  we provide services through three operating business divisions commercial services  logistics  processing and disposal lp d and international 
our government group provides services to united states us government customers for the management and operation m o  and or clean up of facilities with radioactive materials 
our government group customers are individual offices  departments and administrations within the us department of energy doe and the us department of defense dod 
our commercial services operations provide a broad range of on site services  including d d services and comprehensive long term stewardship d d work for shut down nuclear power plants and similar operations  to commercial customers 
our commercial customers include power and utility companies  pharmaceutical companies  research laboratories  universities  industrial facilities  state agencies and other commercial entities that are involved with nuclear materials as well as state agencies in the us our lp d operations provide a broad range of logistics  transportation  processing and disposal services to both government and commercial customers 
our lp d division also operates our facilities for the processing and disposal of radioactive materials  including our facility in clive  utah  four facilities in tennessee  and two facilities in barnwell  south carolina 
our international division derives revenue primarily through contracts with the nuclear decommissioning authority nda in the united kingdom uk to operate  manage and decommission ten magnox sites with twenty two nuclear reactors 
in addition  our international division also provides turn key services and sub contract services for the treatment  processing  storage and disposal of radioactive waste from nuclear sites and non nuclear facilities such as hospitals  research facilities and other manufacturing and industrial facilities 
in september  we entered into an arrangement with exelon to decommission and dismantle the zion station nuclear power plant that ceased operation in pursuant to the arrangement  we acquired from exelon the zion station nuclear decommissioning trust ndt fund which serves as the sole source of funding for the project 
the profitability of the zion station project is a function of project cost management and ndt fund earnings performance 
the elements of the project s profitability are principally composed of i profit margins we anticipate realizing from the transportation and disposal of llrw from the project  ii reimbursement for an allocated portion of corporate general and administrative overhead  and iii fees we expect to earn from management of the project 
in order to complete the project profitably  we must successfully manage project costs and achieve sufficient earnings on the ndt fund to meet the overall project budget  which is expected to approach billion over the life of the project 
over the ten year term of the zion station project  we will perform periodic comprehensive reviews and assessments of project milestones  schedules  costs and related projected decommissioning trust fund values a schedule and cost update  which is standard for all such long term projects 
in february  we completed our first schedule and cost update  the findings and results of which are as follows total projected project costs have increased from the original budgeted amounts  due primarily to increased regulatory requirements and resulting higher estimates for site security  and to heightened projections for final site characterization and radiation protection 
ndt fund investment earnings have outperformed initial projections to date 
the profit margin of the project is currently estimated to range from approximately to 
opportunities have been identified in the updated project budget for cost reduction across various operational activities which  if successfully executed  would enhance the project s profitability 

table of contents the project is approximately six months ahead of schedule and is delivering excellent technical and safety performance 
due to the accelerated progress on the project and the completion of over  project purchase orders  current and future project cost risks and uncertainties have been significantly reduced 
the project s tracking and cost estimation systems have been upgraded and will serve as improved tools for future schedule optimization  cost reduction and project management 
the foregoing projections  expectations and estimates  together with all other forward looking statements regarding the project  are based upon current assumptions and are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
see item a 
risk factors our license stewardship arrangement with exelon exposes us to significant financial risks and the future performance of the zion station project is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
for financial reporting purposes  the zion station project is subject to the aro method of accounting 
measurement of the aro follows asc accounting guidance  including the recognition of accretion expense  reassessment of the remaining liability using our estimated cost to complete the project plus a profit margin  and recognition of the aro gain as the obligation is settled 
accretion expense and the aro gain are recorded within cost of revenue 
any change to the aro as a result of cost estimate changes is also recorded within cost of revenue 
as a result of the schedule and cost update  we included in cost of revenue for the fourth quarter of a charge in the amount of million  which consisted of project cost estimate changes  related accretion expense and other aro accounting adjustments 
this charge is included in cost of revenue of our commercial services operations within our global commercial group 
for further discussion of the zion station project aro accounting  see note to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form k 
for further information regarding the ndt fund and investment earnings performance  see note to our consolidated financial statements included within this annual report on form k 
due to adverse stock market conditions that existed during the third and fourth quarter of  our stock price and corresponding market capitalization declined significantly 
given this decline  applicable accounting rules required that we perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of december  as a result of this test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge for the government group and lp d reporting units totaling million for the quarter ended december  this non cash charge reduces goodwill recorded in connection with previous acquisitions and does not impact our overall business operations  cash position  operating cash flow or debt covenants 
as a result of the goodwill impairment charge  we recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
we provide valuation allowances against potential future benefits when  in the opinion of management  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a significant piece of evidence considered was our recent cumulative profitability 
due to the size of the net operating loss  driven by the goodwill impairment and the aro charge resulting from the zion station project schedule and cost update  we have a cumulative three year pretax loss position as of december  while we anticipate profitability in the future  the uncertainty inherent in forecasting future performance requires the evidence of past results to outweigh the evidence of future expectations in making the decision to record a valuation allowance 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain deferred tax assets for the quarter ended december  as noted above  our results of operations for the year ended december  include an aro charge of million related to the schedule and cost update for the zion station project  a million non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and a million non cash charge for a valuation allowance recorded against certain of our deferred tax assets 
excluding these charges  income from operations in would have been million  net income would have been million and diluted net income attributable to energysolutions per share would have been 
our results of operations for year ended december  included a charge of million for an aro cost estimate change for the zion station project and a million non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill 
excluding these charges  income from operations in would have been million  net income would have been million and diluted net income attributable to energysolutions per share would have been 

table of contents components of revenue and expenses revenue and cost of revenue government group we generate revenue in our government group primarily from m o and clean up services on doe and dod sites that have radioactive materials 
under tier contracts  we typically provide services as an integrated member of a prime contract team 
under tier contracts  we provide services to tier contractors on a subcontracted basis 
tier contracts often include an award fee in excess of incurred costs  and may also include an incentive fee for meeting contractual targets  milestones  or performance factors 
historically  the majority of our government group revenue has been generated from either tier cost reimbursable contracts with award typically based on a percentage of cost or incentive typically success based fees  or tier contracts that are cost reimbursable  fixed price  unit rate  and time and material contracts 
when we have provided services as an integrated member of a tier prime contract team  we have typically entered into contracts with the other members of the team in which we share the award or incentive fees under the customer contract 
the revenue characteristics of these contracts are as follows tier contract  acting as lead prime contractor 
in situations where we act as lead prime contractor in a fee sharing arrangement  we submit invoices to the customer for recovery of costs incurred in providing project services  and we also submit to the customer the cost recovery invoices of the other team members that have been submitted to us 
depending on the nature of the contract  we typically recognize as revenue the entire amount of our fee and cost reimbursement as lead prime contractor  and record an expense for the portion of the fee and cost reimbursement that we pay to the other team members in proportion to their respective percentages of the fee sharing arrangement and costs 
as a result  when we act as lead prime contractor  we recognize higher revenue and may realize higher gross profits but lower gross margins than when we do not act as lead prime contractor 
tier contract  not acting as lead prime contractor 
in situations where we do not act as lead prime contractor  we submit invoices to the lead prime contractor for recovery of costs incurred in providing project services  including allocated selling  general and administrative expenses  as allowed by the customer  and we may receive a portion of the fee in direct proportion to our percentage of a fee sharing arrangement 
we include in revenue the amount to be received as reimbursement for costs incurred plus the portion of the fee that we will receive 
the majority of our tier contracts have historically fallen into this category 
tier contract 
tier contracts are typically discrete  project driven transactions procured by tier contractors 
the majority of tier contracts are fixed price or cost reimbursable contracts 
we generally do not participate in fee share arrangements as a tier contractor 
revenue in our government group can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of differences in the timing and size of contract awards in any given period  whether or not we are required to consolidate an entity under a joint venture agreement  and reflect its revenue within our financial statements  the completion or expiration of large contracts  and delays in congressional appropriations for contracts we have been awarded 
we typically generate revenue in our government group pursuant to long term contracts 
the process of bidding for government contracts is extremely competitive and time consuming 
discussions relating to a potential government contract often begin one or two years before release of a rfp 
an additional year or two years may pass between the government s announcement of an rfp and its award of a contract  and an additional several months may pass before we begin to recognize revenue in connection with contracts we are awarded 
cost of revenue in our government group consists primarily of compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  costs of goods purchased for use in projects  and travel expenses 

table of contents global commercial group within the global commercial group  we provide services through three operating business divisions commercial services  lp d and international 
commercial services operations we generate revenue in our commercial services division through fixed price  unit rate  and cost reimbursable contracts with power and utility companies that operate nuclear power plants and  to a lesser extent  with pharmaceutical companies  research laboratories  universities  industrial facilities and other commercial entities that have nuclear related operations 
revenue in our commercial services division can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of differences in customer requirements  which depend upon the operating schedules of nuclear reactors  emergency response operations  and other clean up events 
the operating schedules of nuclear reactors are affected by  among other things  seasonality in the demand for electricity  and reactor refueling and maintenance schedules 
power and utility companies typically schedule refueling and maintenance to coincide with periods of reduced power demand periods in the spring and fall 
therefore  our revenue is typically higher during these periods due to the increased demand for our on site services 
our revenue also fluctuates from period to period as our commercial power and utility customers start or terminate project operations 
revenue from emergency response operations and other clean up activities may also cause fluctuations in our results due to the unanticipated nature of events that result in these projects 
revenue in our commercial services division also depends on the decisions of our customers to incur expenditures for third party nuclear services 
for example  they may choose to store radioactive materials on site  rather than transporting materials for commercial processing and disposal at third party facilities  such as our clive  utah facility 
similarly  customers may defer entering into contracts for d d services at nuclear plants that have been shut down until such time as they have additional dedicated funds to perform that work 
cost of revenue in our commercial services division consists primarily of compensation and benefits to employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  costs of goods purchased for use in projects  and travel expenses 
cost of revenue also includes the accretion expense related to our zion aro  zion aro settlement gains or losses as work is performed on the zion station decommissioning project  and any changes in cost estimates related to the zion aro 
lp d operations we generate revenue in our lp d division primarily through unit rate contracts for the transportation  processing and disposal of radioactive materials 
in general  the unit rate contracts entered into by our lp d division use a standardized set of purchase order type contracts containing standard pricing and other terms 
by using standardized contracts  we are able to expedite individual project contract negotiations with our customers through means other than formal bidding processes 
for example  our life of plant contracts provide nuclear power and utility company customers with llrw and mllw processing and disposal services for the remaining lives of their nuclear power plants  as well as d d waste disposal services after those plants are shut down 
these contracts generally provide that we will process and dispose of substantially all of the llrw and mllw generated by those plants for a fixed  pre negotiated price per cubic foot  depending on the type of radioactive material being disposed  and often include periodic price adjustments 
although life of plant contracts may be terminated before decommissioning work is complete  we typically expect the duration of these contracts to be in excess of ten years 
revenue in our lp d division can fluctuate significantly depending on the timing of our customers decommissioning activities 
we can receive high volumes of radioactive materials in a relatively short time period when a customer s site or facility is being decommissioned 
cost of revenue in our lp d division consists primarily of compensation and benefit expenses of employees  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  such as rail transportation of radioactive materials from a customer s site to one of our facilities for processing and disposal  costs of goods purchased for use in our facilities  licenses  permits  taxes on processed radioactive materials  maintenance of facilities  equipment costs  and depreciation costs 
most of our fixed assets are in our lp d division  and we recognize the majority of our depreciation costs in this division 

table of contents international operations we generate revenue in our international division primarily through tier contracts with the nda 
as a tier contractor  we are reimbursed for allowable incurred costs 
in addition  we receive a range of cost efficiency fees a percentage of budgeted costs minus actual costs for work performed and project delivery based incentive fees 
we typically recognize as revenue the full amount of reimbursed allowable costs incurred plus the amount of fees earned  and we record as expense the amount of our operating costs incurred  including all labor  benefits  travel expenses  and the costs of our subcontractors 
we recognize fees as revenue only when the amount to be received is fixed or determinable 
our contracts with the nda allow for a portion of the fees we receive to be paid monthly on account during the year 
the total amount paid on account at the year end cannot exceed a combined of the total base incentive fee available and of the efficiency fee earned 
for the first six months of the contract year  which ends on march  we receive monthly account payments of fees equivalent to of the total available fees for the contract year  although the monthly amount of the base incentive fee may be increased to reflect actual fees earned in the period if mutually agreed 
the contract requires a joint performance review with the nda at the end of the sixth month and ninth month periods of the contract year 
the purpose of the review is to establish a forecast of fees expected to be earned in the year  against which future scheduled monthly fee payments are assessed  and potentially adjusted  to ensure that the total fees paid on account by the end of the contract year will not exceed the contractual limits 
in july  following the end of the contract year  we expect to finalize any earned but unpaid incentive and efficiency fees due from the nda and to receive a corresponding final fee payment 
our contracts with the nda are based on an annual funding cycle and incentive plan 
consequently  revenue can vary from year to year depending on the level of annual funding  the nature of performance based incentives negotiated and efficiency fee mechanisms in place 
cost of revenue in our international division consists primarily of compensation and benefits to employees  travel expenses  outsourcing costs for subcontractor services  and costs of goods purchased for use in projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include expenses that are not directly associated with performing nuclear services for our customers 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits for management and administrative personnel  expenses associated with preparing contract bids  office expenses  advisory fees  professional fees  strategic growth initiatives such as research and development  and administrative overhead 
we segregate our sg a expenses into two categories for reporting purposes 
group sg a expenses reflect costs specifically associated with each of our business groups  such as costs for segment leadership compensation and expenses  specific business development activities  and other costs associated with a specific segment 
corporate sg a expenses reflect costs associated with supporting the entire company including executive management and administrative functions such as accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  and information technology  and other costs required to support the company s operations 
interest expense interest expense includes both cash and accrued interest expense  the amortization of deferred financing costs  fees  debt discounts and interest paid on outstanding letters of credit 
other income  net other income  expense net includes realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments classified as trading securities  interest income  mark to market gains and losses on our derivative contracts and transactional foreign currency gains and losses 
outlook we expect the following factors to affect our results of operations in future periods 
in addition to these factors  please refer to the factors described in section item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k for additional information on what could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations 

table of contents revenue may be impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
during the year ended december   revenue from our international segment was of our total consolidated revenue 
most of the revenue in our international segment is derived from contracts with the nda in the uk  which are denominated in pound sterling 
over the past three months  the pound sterling has held its value at an average exchange rate of 
equity based compensation expense 
we account for equity based compensation payments  including grants to employees  based on the fair values of the equity instruments issued 
as of december   we have outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of million shares of common stock  of which million are unvested  and we have  unvested restricted shares of our common stock outstanding 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million  and million  in  and  respectively  and expect to record compensation expense of million in as a result of these outstanding unvested options and unvested restricted shares 
during  we expect to grant additional stock options and restricted stock awards 
capital expenditures 
we had capital expenditures of approximately million in related to building improvements at three of our existing facilities  the purchase of transportation equipment and rail containers for our operations at our disposal facilities  and the purchase of computer hardware and software 
we had capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively 
we anticipate that capital expenditures in will range from approximately million to million related mostly to purchases of equipment and property improvements at our facilities 
amortization costs related to intangible assets 
we expect non cash amortization costs to remain constant in  provided we do not acquire any significant businesses or intangible assets and foreign exchange rates remain constant 
we incurred approximately million of non cash amortization expense in and million of non cash amortization expense in  related to the intangible assets acquired in  and we expect to incur million of non cash amortization expense in interest expense 
borrowings under the senior secured credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to adjusted libor plus  or abr plus 
based on our outlook for interest rates and our expectations regarding libor fluctuations during  we expect our interest expense associated with our senior secured credit facility to increase less than during from our interest expense of million in borrowings under our senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate 
during we incurred approximately million of interest expense related to our senior notes and we expect to incur approximately the same amount during we expect to recognize approximately million of non cash amortization expense of deferred financing costs and debt discounts in income taxes 
our effective tax rate in was resulting primarily from pretax book losses  lower tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  a lower statutory rate at the ndt trust level  recognition of uncertain tax positions in the us  and research and development tax credits 
the company recorded additional tax expense associated with ndt trust earnings being taxed at both the corporate and trust levels  the add back of a portion of the goodwill impairment that is not deductible for tax purposes  and a valuation allowance against certain domestic and foreign deferred tax assets 
we anticipate our effective tax rate for  exclusive of any unusual items  will be approximately to

for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge attributable to our government group 
for the year ended december  we recorded million of income from our unconsolidated joint ventures of which million income is attributable to the government group and a million loss is attributable to lp d 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  government group revenue and cost of revenue in our government group decreased million and million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of the completion of certain large contracts with the doe and to decreased arra funding during as a result  gross profit decreased by million while gross margin increased to for the year  compared to for the prior year 
the increase in gross margin was due primarily to the commencement of new  more profitable projects during the end of arra funding and an overall reduction of federal government spending could negatively affect the financial results of our government group in future years 
in  as part of our ongoing cost reduction efforts and initiatives  the government group reduced its work force by approximately employees which is expected to generate future costs savings 
revenue and cost of revenue from operations in the southwest region increased million and million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year  due primarily to additional work scope on existing projects and the award of a new contract during the second quarter of that is now in full operation

table of contents global commercial group commercial services operations revenue and cost of revenue from our commercial services operations increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the ramp up of our decommissioning work at the zion station nuclear power plant 
the disproportional increase in cost of revenue when compared to revenue resulted from the recording of an aro cost adjustment in the amount of million related to the zion station project  for which no corresponding revenue was recognized 
as a result  gross profit decreased million for the year compared to the prior year  and gross margin decreased to a negative for the year compared to for the prior year 
during  the global commercial group reduced its work force by approximately employees which is expected to generate future costs savings 
revenue and cost of revenue related to the decommissioning of the zion station increased million and million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year primarily due to having only four months of activity in compared to one full year of activity in in addition  the company performed its first schedule and cost update review of the zion station project during and identified certain cost items that are estimated to be higher than the original project estimates 
as a result  the company recorded a million cost adjustment to the current cost estimates during excluding the effect of the cost adjustment  gross profit for the zion station project increased million for the year compared to the prior year  after considering the impact of accretion expense and aro settlement gain 
revenue and cost of revenue from our commercial products division increased million and million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year  primarily from increased demand for liners and engineered equipment and increased engineering design and fabrication activities during the year

revenue and cost of revenue from our commercial utility projects division decreased million and increased million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year  due primarily to the substantial completion of work on three large scale utility projects during the disproportional increase in cost of revenue when compared to revenue year over year resulted from schedule delays  subcontractor equipment failures  and costs overruns on two major fixed price contracts 
as a result  gross profit decreased million for the year compared to the prior year 
revenue and cost of revenue from our commercial decommissioning services projects decreased million and million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year due primarily to the completion of the federated metals project during  which was partially offset by a slight increase in revenue from our operations at pearl harbor  hawaii 
as a result  gross profit decreased million for the year compared to the prior year 
revenue and cost of revenue from our liquid waste processing division decreased million and million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year  due primarily to the completion of certain large projects during while there were fewer large scale projects to replace them in as a result  gross profit decreased million for the year compared to the prior year 
revenue and cost of revenue from our commercial technology and engineering operations decreased million and million  respectively  for the year compared to the prior year  due primarily to the completion of a key engineering study of a nuclear fuel fabrication plant during  whereas no project of this magnitude took place in as a result  gross profit decreased million for the year compared to the prior year 
lp d operations revenue from our lp d operations decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   due primarily to lower receipts of waste from doe contracts  decreased shipments of depleted uranium tubes  and decreased rail transportation services provided during the year  which was partially offset by increased incineration activities at our bear creek facility 
gross profit decreased by million and gross margin decreased to for the year from in the prior year  due primarily to increases in labor and subcontractor costs 
revenue related to our disposal facilities decreased million for the year compared to the prior year  due primarily to lower volumes of waste receipts on doe projects due in part to a decrease in arra funding during and decreased decommissioning activities during the year

liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through cash provided by operations 
our cash flow from operations are primarily impacted by fluctuations in working capital caused by the timing of our billings to customers  collection terms of our contracts  stages of completion of our projects  the timing of payments to vendors and subcontractors  the timing of payment of dividends from our unconsolidated joint ventures  the changes in income tax liabilities  and unforeseen events 
for the year ended december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in existing cash and cash equivalents  of which million was held in foreign jurisdictions  and million of availability under the million revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility  which is net of million of outstanding letters of credit issued against it 
due to us tax laws and regulations  our ability to use our cash held in foreign jurisdictions to fund us operations is limited 
as of december   we also had million in accounts receivable and million in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts to fund our operations 
our days sales outstanding dso remained constant at days as of december  compared to the prior year 
we use dso to monitor the average time  in days  that it takes us to convert our accounts receivable into cash 
we calculate dso by dividing accounts receivable as of the end of the year into the amount of revenue recognized during the year  and multiplying the result of that calculation by the number of days in that year 
our cash flow from operations for the year ended december   has been sufficient to cover our operating expenses without the need to draw on our revolving credit facility to cover any shortfalls in the timing of receipts and payments 
we are actively engaged in managing our working capital to reduce our dso to generate cash that will allow us to accelerate our plans to reduce debt and to fund the growth of our business

certain trends or uncertainties could have a material impact on our liquidity 
for example  if interest rates increase substantially  that could dramatically increase our cash interest expense  if we are required to increase our bonding requirements on current or future projects it could materially impact our available liquidity under the revolving credit facility  if the economy suddenly weakens or governments materially reduce future funding for nuclear remediation or d d 
table of contents projects  these events could have a negative effect on our liquidity 
under certain terms and conditions we have the ability  absent an event of default  to increase our senior secured credit facility by up to million 
we do not anticipate the need to access this incremental commitment in our revolving credit facility

our principal needs for liquidity have been  and will continue to be  for working capital  to pay down debt  and for capital expenditures 
on september   as part of the closing of the zion station transaction  the company took over ownership of a dedicated ndt fund  which exists for the sole purpose of decommissioning the zion station nuclear power plant

we expect that we will be reimbursed from the ndt fund for the work we perform to decommission the plant 
however  in the event that we do not comply with the contractual requirements included in the agreements with exelon  we may become subject to additional financial restrictions 
these additional financial restrictions may take the form of not being able to bill the ndt fund for work performed  funding the work on the project through our other cash flows  increasing the letter of credit amount established for this project  or having the letter of credit drawn down by exelon 
we accumulated benefit obligations related to the pension plan we are involved with of billion as of december  see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report form k for a more detailed discussion

as a result  we are reimbursed for contributions made to the magnox pension plan under the terms of these contracts 
thus  we have no potential net funding requirements relative to the accumulated benefit obligation of the magnox pension plan 
we are required to fund the pension plan for our employees of energysolutions eu limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of energysolutions  inc the plan is currently funded by contributions from us and the employees

at december  the variable interest rate on our term loan was 
assuming that this rate remains constant during the following years and assuming no prepayments  our interest payment obligations related to the term loan obligations would be approximately million for each of the next five years 
we also have obligations to pay million outstanding balance of our senior notes 
we have no minimum principal payments obligations of the senior note within the next years 
at this rate  our interest payment obligations related to the senior notes would be million for each of the next years 
includes million long term liability related to the demolition permit to perform activities at the zion station  long term rate reserves of million  and other long term d d liabilities of approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have a number of routine operating leases  primarily related to real estate  equipment for project contracts  rail equipment  and investments in joint ventures at december  as of december   we had an outstanding variable rate term loan of million 
under our senior secured credit facility  we are required to maintain one or more hedge agreements bearing interest at a fixed rate in the aggregate notional amount of no less than of the outstanding principal amounts of our long term debt 
since the outstanding balances under our senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and totaled million as of december   which is of our outstanding term loan  we were not required to enter into new hedge agreements 
however  we retained the collar interest rate agreement required under our former credit facilities for the aggregate notional amount of million until its maturity date on january  as of december   the fair value liability of our interest rate collar agreement was approximately million 
from time to time  we are required to post standby letters of credit and surety bonds to support contractual obligations to customers  self insurance programs  closure and post closure financial assurance  as well as other obligations 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit issued under our senior secured credit facility and million of letters of credit issued against our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had million in surety bonds outstanding 
with respect to the surety bonds  we have entered into certain indemnification agreements with the providers of the surety bonds  which would require funding by us only if we fail to perform under the contracts being insured and the surety bond issuer was obligated to make payment to the insured parties 
our processing and disposal facilities operate under licenses and permits that require financial assurance for closure and post closure costs 
we provide for these requirements through a combination of restricted cash  cash deposits  letters of credit and insurance policies 
as of december   the closure and post closure requirements for our facilities were million 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that are uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are often based on judgments that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  but all such estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
actual results may differ 
table of contents from those estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that other professionals  applying their own judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could develop and support alternative estimates and assumptions that would result in material changes to our operating results and financial condition 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective estimates and assumptions 
our critical accounting policies are discussed below 
accounting for the exelon transaction in december  we entered into certain agreements with exelon to dismantle the zion station  including a planning contract under which we were engaged to perform certain preparatory services  with payment contingent upon closing of an asset sale agreement 
although we entered into this contract in december  we postponed the closing of the transaction due to the financial crisis affecting the stock markets at the time  and as a result all costs associated with the execution of the planning phase were also deferred 
the transaction closed on september  after closing  we recognized the costs and the related revenue associated with the planning contract in our consolidated statements of operations  with million in revenue representing the related gross profit amount being deferred over the period of d d work 
on the date of the closing of the asset sale agreement  the ndt fund investments of approximately million previously held by exelon for the purpose of decommissioning the zion station nuclear power plant were transferred to us and the use of those funds and any investments returns arising therein  remains restricted solely to that purpose 
as part of this transaction  we have assumed exelon s cost basis in the investments  for tax purposes  which included an unrealized gain of approximately million at the closing date which resulted in a deferred tax liability of approximately million 
the investments are classified as trading securities and as such  the investment gains and losses are recorded in the statement of operations as other income or expense 
to the extent that the ndt fund assets exceed the costs to perform the d d work  we have a contractual obligation to return any excess funds to exelon 
throughout the period over which we perform the d d work  we will assess whether such a contingent liability exists using the measurement thresholds under asc as the ndt fund assets that were transferred to us represent a prepayment of fees to perform the d d work  we also recorded deferred revenue  including deferred revenue associated with the planning contract  of million 
revenue recognition throughout the life of the project is based on the proportional performance method using a cost to cost approach 
in conjunction with the acquisition of the shut down nuclear power plant  we became responsible for and assumed the aro for the plant  and we established and initially measured an aro in accordance with asc subsequent measurement of the aro will follow asc accounting guidance  including the recognition of accretion expense  reassessment of the remaining liability using our estimated costs to complete the d d work plus a profit margin  and recognition of the aro gain as the obligation is settled 
accretion expense and the aro gain will be recorded within cost of revenue because  through this arrangement  we are providing d d services to a customer 
any change to the aro as a result of cost estimate changes will also be recorded to cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations in the period identified 
we also recorded deferred costs to reflect the costs incurred to acquire the future revenue stream 
the deferred cost balance was initially recorded at million  which is the same value as the initial aro  and will be amortized into cost of revenue in the same manner as deferred revenue  using the proportional performance method 
revenue recognition we record revenue when all of the following conditions exist evidence of an agreement with our customer  work has actually been performed  the amount of revenue is fixed or determinable  and collection from our customer is reasonably assured 

table of contents federal  commercial and international contracts our services are provided under cost reimbursable plus award or incentive fee  fixed price  and unit rate contracts 
the following describes our policies for these contract types cost reimbursable contracts we are reimbursed for allowable costs in accordance with federal acquisition regulations far  cost accounting standards cas or contractual provisions 
if our costs exceed the contract ceiling or are not allowable under the provisions of the contract  far  or cas  we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for such costs 
a contract may also provide for award fees or incentive fees in addition to cost reimbursements 
incentive fees are earned if we meet certain contract provisions  including schedule  budget and safety 
monthly assessments are made to measure the amount of revenue earned in accordance with established contract provisions 
award and incentive fees are accrued when estimable and collection is reasonably assured 
fixed price contracts we receive a fixed amount of revenue irrespective of the actual costs we incur 
for fixed price contracts  our revenue are recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting using appropriate output measures  where estimable  or on other measures such as proportion of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
unit rate contracts for unit rate contracts  our revenue are recognized using the proportional performance method of accounting as units are completed based on contractual unit rates 
accounting for revenue earned under our contracts may require assessments that include an estimate of the amount that has been earned on the contract and are usually based on the volumes that have been processed or disposed  milestones reached or the time that has elapsed under the contract 
each of our contracts is unique with regard to scope  schedule and delivery methodology 
accordingly  each contract is reviewed to determine the most reliable measure of completion for revenue recognition purposes 
input measures such as costs incurred to total contract costs are used only when there are no quantifiable output measures available and represent a reasonable basis for determining the relative status of the project given that  on many contracts  costs are the basis for determining the overall contract value and timing 
certain of our fixed price contracts are for services that are non linear in nature  require complex  non repetitive tasks or involve a non time based scope of work 
in these contracts  the earnings process is not fulfilled upon the achievement of milestones  but rather over the life of the contract 
evaluation of the obligations and customer requirements on these contracts does not produce objective  quantifiable output measures that reflect the earnings process for revenue recognition 
therefore  in these situations  we use a cost to cost approach to determine revenue 
a cost to cost approach accurately reflects our obligations and performance on these contracts  as well as meeting our customers expectations of service being performed 
therefore  we believe that input measures used to measure progress toward completion on certain fixed price projects provide a reasonable surrogate as compared to using output measures 
for the years ended december   and  revenue calculated using a cost to cost approach  including zion station project revenues  were million  million and million respectively 
revisions to revenue  cost and profit estimates  or measurements of the extent of progress toward completion  are changes in accounting estimates accounted for in the period of change cumulative catch up method 
contracts typically provide for periodic billings on a monthly basis or based on contract milestones 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represent amounts recognized as revenue that have not been billed 
unearned revenue represents amounts billed and collected for which revenue has not been recognized 
we record contract claims and pending change orders  including requests for equitable adjustments reas when collection of revenue is reasonably assured  which generally is when accepted in writing by the customer 
the costs to perform the work related to these claims and pending change orders including reas are included in our financial statements in the period that they are incurred and are included in our estimates of contract profitability 
a provision for estimated losses on individual contracts is recognized in the period in which the losses are identified and includes all estimated direct costs to complete such contracts excluding future general and administrative costs expected to be allocated to the contracts 
monthly assessments are performed on our estimates and changes are made based on the latest information available 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded provision for losses in the amount of million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents lp d contracts our lp d services are provided primarily under unit rate contracts 
revenue is recognized as units of materials are processed or disposed based on the unit prices provided in the contracts 
d d liabilities we have responsibility for the cost to d d our facilities and related equipment  as well as the equipment used at customer sites in our commercial services segment 
these costs are generally paid upon closure of the facilities or disposal of the equipment 
we are also responsible for the cost of monitoring our clive  utah facility over its post closure period 
we have also acquired the shut down nuclear power plants at exelon s zion station in  and assumed the related d d liabilities 
accounting guidance for aros requires us to record the fair value of an aro as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development or normal use of the asset except for the zion station related aro 
we are also required to record a corresponding asset that we depreciate over the life of the asset 
for the zion station related aro we do not record an aro asset that depreciates because the underlying tangible assets have no future value 
instead  upon acquisition we capitalized deferred project costs that will be amortized to cost of revenue as the work is performed 
after the initial measurement of our aros  the aro is adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time accretion and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the cost basis for our landfill assets and related obligations include landfill liner material and installation  excavation for airspace  landfill leachate collection systems  environmental groundwater and air monitoring equipment  directly related engineering and design costs and other capital infrastructure costs 
also included in the cost basis of our landfill assets and related obligations are estimates of future costs associated with final landfill capping  closure and post closure monitoring activities 
these costs are described below final capping involves the installation of final cap materials over areas of the landfill where total airspace has been consumed 
we estimate available airspace capacity using aerial and ground surveys and other methods of calculation  based on permit mandated height restrictions and other factors 
final capping aros are recorded  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as landfill airspace capacity is permitted for waste disposal activities and the cell liner is constructed 
final capping costs are recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows and capacity associated with the final capping event 
closure involves the remediation of our land surrounding the disposal cell and the disposal of company owned property and equipment 
these are costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste  but before the site is certified to be closed by the applicable regulatory agency 
these costs are accrued as an aro  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill 
closure obligations are accrued over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities 
post closure involves the maintenance and monitoring of our landfill site that has been certified to be closed by the applicable regulatory agency 
subsequent to landfill closure  we are required to maintain and monitor our landfill site for a year period 
these maintenance and monitoring costs are accrued as an aro  with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset  as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill 
post closure obligations are accrued over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing post closure activities 
the cost basis for our aros and  if applicable  our aro assets includes costs to decontaminate  disassemble and dispose of equipment and facilities 
we develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel  engineers and accountants 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and proposed regulatory changes and are intended to approximate fair value 
we use historical experience  professional engineering judgment and quoted and actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations 
we recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work ourselves 
costs for the d d of our facilities and equipment will generally be paid upon the closure of these facilities or the disposal of this equipment 
we are obligated under our license granted by the state of south carolina and the atlantic interstate low level radioactive waste compact implementation act for costs associated with the ultimate closure of the 
table of contents barnwell low level radioactive waste disposal facility in south carolina and our buildings and equipment located at the barnwell site barnwell closure 
under the terms of the atlantic waste compact act and our license with the state of south carolina  we are required to maintain a trust fund to cover the barnwell closure obligation  which limits our obligation to the amount of the trust fund 
we are required to make significant estimates in the determination of our aros and the related assets  if applicable 
our cost estimates for final capping  closure and post closure activities and other d d activities are intended to approximate fair value and are based on our interpretation of the current regulatory requirements and proposed or anticipated regulatory changes 
where applicable  these cost estimates are based on the amount a third party would charge to perform such activities even when we expect to perform these activities internally 
because final landfill capping  closure and post closure obligations and decontamination and decommissioning obligations are measured using present value techniques  changes in the estimated timing of the related activities would have an effect on these liabilities  related assets and resulting operations 
changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs  timing or extent of the required future capping  closure  post closure and other d d activities typically result in both i a current adjustment to the recorded liability and asset and ii a change in the liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over the remaining life of the asset in accordance with our depreciation policy 
however  for the zion station aro  these charges are recorded directly to cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
for instance  in  we recorded million to cost of revenue to reflect a net increase in estimated costs associated with the zion station project 
a hypothetical increase in the inflation rate would have increased our aros by million 
a hypothetical increase in our cost estimate would have increased our aros by million 
we update our d d and closure and post closure cost estimates either annually or more frequently if changes in the underlying conditions occur 
these estimates are based on current technology  regulations and burial rates 
changes in these factors could have a material impact on our estimates 
recoverability of long lived assets  including goodwill as of december  and  we had recorded million and million  respectively  of goodwill related to domestic and foreign acquisitions 
goodwill related to the acquisitions of foreign entities is translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
the related translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded approximately  and million  respectively  of translation losses related to goodwill denominated in foreign currencies 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an impairment test on goodwill annually  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
our annual testing date is april for purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment  goodwill is allocated to each of our reporting units which are government group  commercial services  lp d and international 
these reporting units were determined based on our internal management reporting and organizational structure 
goodwill is assigned to each of these reporting units based on which of the reporting units derive the benefits of an acquired company 
if multiple reporting units benefit from an acquisition  goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit based on an allocation of revenue between the reporting units at the acquisition date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net revenue and operating expenses  based primarily on pricing  market segment share and general economic conditions 
changes in future forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could result in future goodwill impairment charges 
as indicated above  we perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of april our annual test did not indicate an impairment of goodwill for any of our reporting units 
however  due to adverse stock market conditions that existed during the third and fourth quarter of  our stock price and corresponding market capitalization declined significantly 
this decline prompted us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test as of december   and as a result  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge for the government group and lp d reporting units totaling million during the quarter ended december  of the million  million was related to the government group and million was related to our lp d reporting unit 
this non cash charge reduces goodwill recorded in connection with previous acquisitions and does not impact our overall business operations  cash position  operating cash flow or debt 
table of contents covenants 
the million goodwill impairment charge was not finalized prior to the issuance of this report but was estimated based on a preliminary goodwill impairment analysis as of december  and represents our best estimate of the impairment charge 
the second step of the impairment test will be completed during the first quarter of and  once completed  any remaining adjustment to the impairment amount will be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
we measured the fair value of the government group and lp d by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies 
we believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis  and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation 
the discounted cash flow analysis calculated the fair value of the government group and lp d using management s business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next four years and a residual growth rate thereafter 
we also used a weighted average discount rate of for the analysis for both the government group and lp d 
other significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis include the profitability of the respective reporting units and working capital effects 
the goodwill balances of our commercial services and international reporting units as of december  were million and million  respectively 
based on a preliminary goodwill impairment analysis performed as of december   the fair value of these reporting units exceeded their carrying value by approximately and  respectively 
since the estimated fair value of the reporting units was in excess of their book value  it was not necessary to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
during and based on the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis  we determined that each of our reporting units fair value substantially exceeded its carrying value  except for the government group 
based on these results  we performed the second step of the impairment analysis for the government group and concluded that the carrying value of our government group was impaired 
we measured the fair value of the government group by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies 
we believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis  and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation 
the discounted cash flow analysis calculated the fair value of the government group using management s business plans and projections as the basis for expected cash flows for the next five years and a residual growth rate thereafter 
we also used a weighted average discount rate of for the analysis 
other significant estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis include the profitability of our government group reporting unit and its working capital effects 
as a result of our impairment test  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge during the second quarter of factors culminating in the impairment included continued weakness in the macroeconomic environment and lower forecasted growth 
the significant factors that we considered in determining the fair value of our government group included the future impact of contracts currently in place  the existence of renewal options on existing contracts  follow on contracts related to existing contracts  outstanding proposals with government customers  known future requests for proposals and expected long term growth in the government group business that approximates inflation 
in determining the fair value of the reporting unit  we probability weighted the future business opportunities based on our internal assessments 
however  some of the proposals are for substantial contract awards and either winning or losing those bids can have a significant impact on our fair value calculations 
the impairment charge did not impact our cash position  operating cash flow or debt covenants 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the date of acquisition 
we assess the useful lives of other intangible assets to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
if the estimate of an intangible asset s remaining useful life is changed  the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist of customer relationships  licenses and permits  technology  and non compete agreements 
customer relationships  which include the fair value of acquired customer contracts  were evaluated for each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology and are amortized on a straight line basis over a term of two to twelve years 
estimated future cash flows for each operating segment were derived based on detailed budgets and projections prepared by management 
licenses and permits were evaluated for each licensed facility using a replacement cost methodology 
also  due to the unique characteristics of our utah disposal facility permits  we also included an opportunity cost reflecting an estimate of earnings that would be lost if we had to replace the licenses and permits as opposed to having acquired them 
licenses and permits are either amortized over the definite terms of the related agreements or over the remaining useful lives of the related intangible asset  typically to years 
estimates of replacement costs were determined by management taking into consideration the cost of labor and other costs needed to meet regulatory requirements to obtain and maintain the licenses or permits 
estimates of opportunity cost were determined by management after considering estimated cash flows for the business generated with the licenses and permits offset by contribution asset charges for other assets of the business that also contribute to cash flow generation 
technology and non compete agreements 
table of contents were evaluated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
intangible technology assets are amortized on a straight line basis over a term of nine to ten years and non compete agreements are amortized over the terms of the contracts 
estimated future cash flows for each technology and non compete agreement were derived based on detailed budgets and projections prepared by management 
long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of excess carrying value over fair value 
share based compensation expense we recognize shared based compensation costs in the statement of operations over the instruments vesting periods based on the instruments fair values on the measurement date  which is generally the date of the grant using an option pricing model which takes into account various assumptions that are subjective 
key assumptions used in the valuation included the expected term of the equity award taking into account both the contractual term of the award  the effects of employees expected exercise and post vesting termination behavior  expected volatility  expected dividends and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the award 
in our share based compensation strategy  we utilize a combination of stock options and restricted stock that vest over time based on service and performance 
for time based stock options and restricted stock  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period from the vesting commencement date using the straight line method 
for performance based stock options and restricted stock compensation  expense is recognized over the vesting period beginning at the grant date if it is probable that performance targets will be achieved 
if prior to the performance measurement date  it is no longer probable that the performance targets will be achieved  the expense related to the grant will be adjusted accordingly and prior recognized compensation expense may be reversed 
also  if at the performance measurement date the performance targets are not achieved  the expense related to the grants will be adjusted to the earned amounts and compensation expense will also be adjusted accordingly 
we have options outstanding to purchase an aggregate of million shares  of which million are unvested  and unvested restricted shares of  as of december  we estimate that we will recognize compensation expense related to the issuance of these awards of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
our estimates of fair value for the stock options was made using the black scholes model based upon the closing stock price on the date of grant  volatility of to  risk free interest rate of to per year  and expected life of years 
we determined the volatility rate by reference to volatility rates used by certain of our public industry peers since we do not have an established trading history of our common stock 
we are currently using the simplified method to calculate expected holding periods  which is based on the average term of the options and the weighted average graded vesting period 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes 
current tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on the tax returns for the current year 
deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards that result from events that have been recognized in either the financial statements or the tax returns  but not both 
the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is based on provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by the amount of any tax benefits that are not expected to be realized 
current and non current components of deferred tax balances are reported separately based on financial statement classification of the related asset or liability giving rise to the temporary difference 
if a deferred tax asset or liability is not related to an asset or liability that exists for financial reporting purposes  including deferred tax assets related to carryforwards  the deferred tax asset or liability would be classified based on the expected reversal date of the temporary difference 
tax benefits associated with tax positions taken in the company s income tax returns are initially recognized and measured in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that those tax positions will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
the company s evaluation of its tax benefits is based on the probability of the tax position being upheld if challenged by the taxing authorities including through negotiation  appeals  settlement and litigation 
whenever a tax position does not meet the initial recognition criteria  the tax benefit is subsequently recognized and measured if there is a substantive change in the facts and circumstances that cause a change in judgment concerning the 
table of contents sustainability of the tax position upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
in cases where tax benefits meet the initial recognition criterion  the company continues  in subsequent periods  to assess its ability to sustain those positions 
a previously recognized tax benefit is derecognized when it is no longer more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon examination 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes 
we recognized interest related to tax refunds as a component of other income 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the normal course of a global business  we may engage in numerous transactions every day for which the ultimate tax outcome including the period in which the transaction will ultimately be included in taxable income or deducted as an expense is uncertain 
although the company believes that its tax return positions are supportable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be materially different than that which is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on the income tax provisions or benefits in the periods in which such determinations are made 
additionally  the tax returns we file are subject to audit and investigation by the internal revenue service  most states in the us  the us  and by various other government agencies representing jurisdictions outside the us disclosure of impact of recently issued accounting standards goodwill impairment in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional guidance regarding testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is not required 
this guidance is effective for fiscal year early adoption is permitted  however we did not early adopt 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
other comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements 
this guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  entities are required to present total comprehensive income either in a single  continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
under the single statement approach  entities must include the components of net income  a total for net income  the components of other comprehensive income and a total for comprehensive income 
under the two statement approach  entities must report an income statement and  immediately following  a statement of other comprehensive income 
under either method  entities must display adjustments for items reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in both net income and other comprehensive income 
the provisions for this pronouncement are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   however  certain provisions related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments have been deferred by recent guidance issued in december  in which entities are allowed to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before the issuance of these updates 
the adoption of this new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements as it only requires a change in the format of the current presentation 
fair market value in may  the fasb issued amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the amendment improves comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements and it also clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the amendment includes the application of the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts  measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s shareholders equity and disclosing quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used within the level hierarchy 
this amendment is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  on a prospective basis 
early application by public entities is not permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents multiple deliverable arrangements in october  the fasb issued an update to the authoritative guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
this update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
this guidance was effective for us on january  the new accounting standard has been applied prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the date of adoption 
the impact of the adoption of this guidance has not had a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our contracts routinely include delivery of multiple products and services to our customers including management and operations or clean up of facilities with radioactive materials  decommissioning and decontamination services  transportation  processing and disposal services 
typically  each of these elements is considered a unit of accounting and revenue is recognized for each element when all of the following have occurred we have entered into an arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  customer payment is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is reasonably assured 
for all contractual arrangements containing multiple deliverables entered into after december   we recognize revenue using estimated selling prices of the delivered products and services based on a hierarchy of methods contained in asu we use vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for determination of estimated selling price of elements in each arrangement if available  and since third party evidence is generally not available for those elements where vsoe of selling price cannot be determined  we evaluate factors to determine our best estimated selling price for all other elements 
application of this new guidance may affect the timing of revenue recognition for some of our contracts as the relative value of each of the elements within the arrangement may change when compared to our prior practices 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
our primary market risk relates to changing interest rates 
as of december   we had outstanding variable rate long term debt of million  of which no current payments are due within the next year due to our voluntary pre payments of debt made during the year 
under the terms of our senior secured credit facility  we are required to maintain one or more hedge agreements bearing interest at a fixed rate in the aggregate notional amount of no less than of the outstanding principal amounts of our long term debt 
since the outstanding balances under our senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and totaled million as of december   which is of our total outstanding term loans  we were not required to enter into new hedge agreements 
a hypothetical interest rate change of on our senior secured credit facility would have changed interest expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
in addition  changes in market interest rates would impact the fair value of our long term obligations 
as of december   we had outstanding term loans with carrying amounts of million with an approximate fair value of million 
we have foreign currency exposure related to our operations in the uk as well as to our operations in other foreign locations 
this foreign currency exposure arises primarily from the translation or re measurement of our foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars 
for example  a substantial portion of our annual sales and operating costs are denominated in pound sterling  and we have exposure related to sales and operating costs increasing or decreasing based on changes in currency exchange rates 
if the us dollar increases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against these foreign currencies  the value in us dollars of the assets and liabilities originally recorded in these foreign currencies will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to these foreign currencies have a direct impact on the value in us dollars of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
we attempt to mitigate the impact of this exchange rate risk by utilizing financial instruments  including derivative transactions pursuant to our policies 
as such  a change in the us dollar exchange rates in effect as of december   would cause a change in consolidated net assets of approximately million and a change in gross profit of approximately million  primarily due to pound sterling denominated exposures 
we maintain a ndt fund to fund the decommissioning of the zion station nuclear plant 
our ndt fund is reflected at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   we had outstanding net investments with carrying amounts of million with an approximate fair value of million 
the mix of securities in the ndt 
table of contents fund is designed to provide capital to be used to fund our zion station d d work and to compensate us for inflationary increases in d d costs 
however  the equity securities in the ndt fund are exposed to price fluctuations in the equity markets  and the value of fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
a hypothetical change in rates of basis points would have changed the fair value of the ndt fund investments by approximately million
