item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  without limitation  those set forth in risk factors  cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  business how we identify and analyze prospects and the other matters set forth in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information presented under selected financial data 
due to the fact that we have not generated any revenues  we believe that the financial information contained in this annual report on form k is not indicative of  or comparable to  the financial profile that we expect to have once we begin to generate revenues 
except to the extent required by law  we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview we are an independent  oil focused exploration and production company with a world class below salt prospect inventory in the deepwater of the us gulf of mexico and offshore angola and gabon in west africa 
all of our prospects are oil focused 
in the us gulf of mexico  we have drilled as operator two exploratory wells ligurian and criollo and participated as non operator in three exploratory wells heidelberg  shenandoah and firefox and two appraisal wells heidelberg and heidelberg 
these drilling efforts have resulted in the heidelberg and shenandoah oil discoveries 
we are currently drilling as operator the ligurian exploratory well 
offshore angola  we have drilled as operator the cameia exploratory well on block which resulted in the cameia pre salt oil discovery 
we continue to mature high impact prospects in our portfolio for upcoming exploratory drilling in both the deepwater of the us gulf of mexico and the deepwater offshore angola and gabon 
in addition  we will progress our existing discoveries toward development and production through follow on appraisal drilling and pre development planning activities 
factors affecting comparability of future results you should read this management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our historical financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
below are the period to period comparisons of our historical results and the analysis of our financial condition 
in addition to the impact of the matters discussed in risk factors  our future results could differ materially from our historical results due to a variety of factors  including the following success in the discovery and development of oil reserves 
because we have no operating history in the production of oil  our future results of operations and financial condition will be directly affected by our ability to discover and develop reserves through our drilling activities 
currently  our estimated oil asset base does not qualify as proved reserves 
the calculation of our geological and petrophysical 
table of contents estimates is complex and imprecise  and it is possible that our future exploration will not result in additional discoveries  and  even if we are able to successfully make such discoveries  there is no certainty that the discoveries will be commercially viable to produce 
our results of operations will be adversely affected in the event that our estimated oil asset base does not result in reserves that may eventually be commercially developed 
oil and gas revenue 
we have not yet commenced oil production 
if and when we do commence production  we expect to generate revenue from such production 
no oil and gas revenue is reflected in our historical financial statements 
production costs 
we have not yet commenced oil production 
if and when we do commence production  we will incur production costs 
production costs are the costs incurred in the operation of producing and processing our production and are primarily comprised of lease operating expense  workover costs and production and ad valorem taxes 
no production costs are reflected in our historical financial statements 
general and administrative expenses 
these costs include expenses associated with our staff costs  information technology  rent  travel  annual and quarterly reporting  investor relations  registrar and transfer agent fees  incremental insurance costs  and accounting and legal services 
as a result of our corporate reorganization in connection with our initial public offering  we are no longer required to pay monitoring fees to certain limited partnership interest holders pursuant to the terms of cobalt international energy  lp s limited partnership agreement 
these differences in general and administrative expenses are not reflected in our historical financial statements other than for fiscal years and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
we have not yet commenced oil or natural gas production 
if and when we do commence production  we will amortize the costs of successful exploration  appraisal  drilling and field development using the unit of production method based on total estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves 
costs of acquiring proved and unproved leasehold properties and associated asset retirement costs will be amortized using the unit of production method based on total estimated proved developed and undeveloped reserves 
no depletion of oil and gas properties is reflected in our historical financial statements 
demand and price 
the demand for oil is susceptible to volatility related to  among other factors  the level of global economic activity and may also fluctuate depending on the performance of specific industries 
we expect that a decrease in economic activity  in the united states and elsewhere  would adversely affect demand for oil we expect to produce 
since we have not generated revenues  these key factors will only affect our financial statements when we produce and sell hydrocarbons 
we expect to earn income from domestic sales  which consist of sales of oil and natural gas  sales to international markets exports  and other sources  including services  investment income and foreign exchange gains 
we expect that our expenses will include costs of sales which are composed of production costs  insurance  and costs associated with the operation of our wells  maintenance and repair of property and equipment  costs of acquiring seismic data  depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  
table of contents depletion of oilfields  exploration costs  selling expenses which include expenses relating to the transportation and distribution of our products and general and administrative expenses  and interest expense and foreign exchange losses 
we expect that fluctuations in our financial condition and results of operations will be driven by a combination of factors  including the volume of oil we produce and sell  changes in the domestic and international prices of oil  which are denominated in us dollars  fluctuations in the royalty rates on the leases that we hold  our success in future bidding rounds for leases and concessions  political and economic conditions in the united states  angola and gabon  and the amount of taxes and duties that we are required to pay with respect to our future operations  by virtue of our status as a us company and our involvement in the oil and gas industry 
results of operations we operate our business in two geographic segments the us gulf of mexico and west africa 
the discussion of the results of operations and the period to period comparisons presented below for each operating segment and our consolidated operations analyzes our historical results

our operating costs and expenses for our us gulf of mexico operations consisted of the following during the years ended december  and seismic and exploration 
seismic and exploration costs decreased by approximately million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was due to million incurred for leasehold delay rentals and drilling preparation expenditures and million incurred for seismic costs during the year ended december   which were offset by million incurred for force majeure costs related to suspended drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico  million incurred for seismic costs  million incurred for leasehold delay rentals and drilling preparation costs in the us gulf of mexico minus the reclassification of million for past technical costs to west africa entities for recovery from partners during the year ended december  dry hole expense and impairment 
dry hole expense and impairment decreased by million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was due to the net effect of i an million charge for the criollo exploratory well representing amounts previously suspended pending further evaluation  ii a million charge against the heidelberg appraisal well  and iii an allowance of million against future impairment on the carrying value of our unproved leasehold properties that are individually less than million during the year ended december   which were offset by iv an million charge against the criollo exploratory well  v an million charge against the heidelberg appraisal well  vi a million charge against the firefox exploratory well  vii a million charge for the ligurian exploratory well  viii a million expense for pre spud costs related to the north platte exploratory well  and ix a million valuation allowance against future impairment on the carrying value of our unproved leasehold properties that are individually less than million during the year ended december  general and administrative 
general and administrative costs increased by million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative costs during this period was primarily attributed to a million increase in staff salaries and bonus costs  a million increase in costs relating to equity based compensation  a million increase in information and technology expenses  and a million increase in other office related expenses  and a million decrease in staff and contractor related costs charged to west africa operations for recovery from partners 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization did not change significantly during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  other income 
other income increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the additional interest recognized as a result of the investment of the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock  which closed on april   in certain investment securities and interest earned on investment securities held during the year ended december  income taxes 
as a result of net operating losses  for income tax purposes  we recorded a net deferred tax asset of million and million with a corresponding full valuation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

liquidity and capital resources we are a development stage enterprise and will continue to be so until commencement of substantial production from our oil properties or we have proved reserves 
we do not know how long it will take to achieve substantial production from our oil properties 
with respect to our cameia pre salt oil discovery  we are currently preparing the development schedule and do not have an estimate of first oil and cash flow at this time 
with respect to our non operated us gulf of mexico discoveries  we are unable to provide information with respect to the operator s development schedule and estimates of first oil and cash flow at this time 
until substantial production is achieved  our primary sources of liquidity are expected to be cash on hand  amounts paid pursuant to the terms of our total alliance and funds from future equity and debt financings  asset sales and farm out arrangements 
we expect to incur substantial expenses and generate significant operating losses as we continue to conduct our current exploration and appraisal drilling program in the us gulf of mexico and offshore angola and gabon  including increased industry costs in the us gulf of mexico resulting from the deepwater horizon incident  develop our discoveries which we determine to be commercially viable  
table of contents purchase and analyze seismic data in order to assess current prospects and identify future prospects  opportunistically invest in additional oil leases and concessional licenses in our focus areas  and incur expenses related to operating as a public company and compliance with regulatory requirements 
our future financial condition and liquidity will be impacted by  among other factors  the success of our exploration and appraisal drilling program  the number of commercially viable hydrocarbon discoveries made and the quantities of hydrocarbons discovered  the speed with which we can bring such discoveries to production  whether and to what extent we invest in additional oil leases and concessional licenses  and the actual cost of exploration  appraisal and development of our prospects 
as of december   we had approximately billion in liquidity  which includes cash and cash equivalents  short term restricted cash  short term investments  long term restricted cash and long term investments 
this amount does not include the total carry or any success payments total is obligated to pay us pursuant to the terms of our us gulf of mexico alliance 
we expect to expend approximately to million for our ongoing operations and general corporate purposes in  which includes the approximate million we funded in january to satisfy our initial obligations under the block psc 
our full year expenditures were approximately million 
we expect that our existing cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our planned exploration and appraisal drilling program at least through the end of however  we may require additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to execute our strategy as planned 
we may seek additional funding through asset sales  farm out arrangements and equity and debt financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our existing stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders will result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our exploration and appraisal drilling programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our prospects which we would otherwise develop on our own  or with a majority working interest 
cash flows year ended december in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash of approximately million used in operating activities during was primarily related to cash payments for seismic expenses  consultants and contractors for west africa operations and staff costs 
the increase in net cash used in compared to was attributable to the increase in cash payments for seismic data acquisition for the us gulf of mexico and offshore west africa  force majeure expenses relating to the deepwater horizon incident and expenses incurred relating to mobilization of the ensco drilling rig  which were offset by the receipt of approximately million from our partner in west africa for reimbursement of past seismic data expenditures and general and administrative charges 
the net cash used in operating activities during was primarily related to cash payments for seismic expenses in the us gulf of

investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in was approximately million  compared with net cash used in investing activities of approximately million and net cash provided by investing activities of approximately million in and  respectively 
the net cash used in primarily relates to investment of the net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in april and capital expenditures relating to the bicuar and cameia exploratory wells offshore angola 
the increase in net cash used in was primarily attributed to the investment of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in certain held to maturity securities 
the decrease in net cash used in was primarily attributed to proceeds received in totaling approximately million for the sale of leasehold interests in the us gulf of mexico  which was offset by an increase in restricted cash to guarantee the ensco rig contract and an increase in exploratory well investment 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in was approximately million  compared with net cash provided by financing activities of approximately and  million in and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in compared to was attributed to the net proceeds we received from our public offering of common stock in april the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in compared to was primarily attributed to the proceeds we received from our initial public offering in december in january  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option in connection with our initial public offering 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in was attributed to cash received from cobalt international energy  lp s class a limited partnership interest holders and the net proceeds of approximately million from the initial public offering and sale of  shares of common stock pursuant to regulation s  which closed on december  contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations were limited to payments to be made in connection with the leases related to the ensco and diamond ocean confidence drilling rigs and other related drilling contracts  office lease payments and lease rental payments for exploration rights from the boem for further exploration in the western and central us gulf of mexico and social payment obligations for blocks  and  offshore west africa

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies this discussion of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the information reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions and estimates on historical experience and other sources that we believe to be reasonable at the time 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we have outlined below certain accounting policies that are of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment or estimates by our management 
revenue recognition 
we plan to follow the sales or cash method of accounting for oil and gas revenues 
under this method  we will recognize revenues on the volumes sold 
the volumes sold may be more or less than the volumes to which we are entitled based on our ownership interest in the property 
these differences result in a condition known in the industry as a production imbalance 
as of december   no revenues have been recognized in our financial statements 
we recognize interest income on bank balances and deposits on a time basis  by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist of all demand deposits and funds invested in highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
demand deposits typically exceed federally insured limits  however we periodically assess the financial condition of the institutions where these funds are held and the credit ratings of the issuers of these instruments and believe that the credit risk is minimal 
investments 
we adopted a policy on accounting for our investments  which consist entirely of debt securities  based on the guidance of accounting standards codification asc no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the debt securities are carried at amortized costs and classified as held to maturity as we have the intent and ability to hold them until they mature 
the net carrying value of held to maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity over the life of the securities 
we conduct a regular assessment of our debt securities with unrealized losses to determine whether securities have other than temporary impairment 
this assessment considers  among other factors  the nature of the securities  credit rating or financial condition of the issuer  the extent and duration of the unrealized loss  market conditions and whether we intend to sell or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities 
property  plant and equipment 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil properties 
acquisition costs for unproved leasehold properties and costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves can be attributed to the areas as a 
table of contents result of drilling those wells 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  proved leasehold costs are capitalized and amortized over the proved developed and undeveloped reserves on a units of production basis 
successful drilling costs  costs of development and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized over the proved developed reserves on a units of production basis 
unproved leasehold costs are capitalized and are not amortized  pending an evaluation of their exploration potential 
significant unproved leasehold costs are assessed on an individual basis periodically to determine if an impairment of the cost of individual properties has occurred 
factors taken into account for impairment analysis include results of the technical studies conducted  lease terms and management s future exploration plans 
the cost of impairment is charged to expense in the period in which it occurs 
costs incurred for exploratory dry holes  geological  and geophysical work including the cost of seismic data and delay rentals are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of other property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line based on their respective useful lives 
inventory 
inventories consist of various tubular products that will be used in our anticipated drilling program 
the inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a weighted average method and comprises of purchase price and other directly attributable costs 
income taxes 
prior to december   no provision for us federal income taxes related to our operations was included in the accompanying financial statements 
as a partnership  we were not subject to federal or state income tax  and the tax effect of our activities accrued to the partners 
the partnership had obligations associated with providing certain tax related information to the partners and registrations and filings with applicable governmental taxing authorities 
effective december   we began using the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc no 
 income taxes as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined by applying tax rates in effect at the end of a reporting period to the cumulative temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
since we are in development stage and there can be no assurance that we will generate any earnings or any specific level of earnings in future years  we will establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets net of liabilities 
use of estimates 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact our reported assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant estimates include i accruals related to expenses  ii assumptions used in estimating fair value of equity based awards  and iii assumptions used in impairment testing 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
estimates of proved oil natural gas reserves 
reserve quantities and the related estimates of future net cash flows affect our periodic calculations of depletion and impairment of our oil and natural gas properties 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
as of december   we do not have any proved reserves 
should proved reserves be found in the future  estimated reserve quantities and future cash flows will be estimated by independent petroleum consultants and prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
table of contents and the financial accounting standards board 
the accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data  estimates regarding the amount and timing of future operating cost  severance taxes  development cost and workover cost  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions such as the future prices of oil and natural gas  and the judgments of the persons preparing the estimates 
asset retirement obligations 
we currently do not have any oil and natural gas production 
should such production occur in the future  we expect to have significant obligations under our lease agreements and federal regulation to remove our equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations 
these asset retirement obligations aro are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and natural gas platforms 
estimating the future restoration and removal cost is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulation often have vague descriptions of what constitutes  removal 
asset removal technologies and cost are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
pursuant to the fasb asc no 
 assets retirement obligations  we are required to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of our asset retirement obligations  with an offsetting increase to the related oil and natural gas properties representing asset retirement costs on our balance sheet 
the cost of the related oil and natural gas asset  including the asset retirement cost  is depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded at its estimated fair value  measured by reference to the expected future cash outflows required to satisfy the retirement obligation discounted at our credit adjusted risk free interest rate 
accretion expense is recognized over time as the discounted liability is accreted to its expected settlement value 
inherent to the present value calculation are numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted risk free rates  timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the abandonment liability  we will make corresponding adjustments to both the asset retirement obligation and the related oil and natural gas property asset balance 
increases in the discounted abandonment liability and related oil and natural gas assets resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as additional accretion and depreciation expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
earnings loss per share 
basic earnings loss per share was calculated by dividing net income or loss applicable to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods presented 
diluted earnings loss per share incorporate the potential dilutive impact of nonvested restricted shares outstanding during the periods presented  unless their effect is anti dilutive 
equity based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation at fair value 
we grant various types of stock based awards including stock options  restricted stock and performance based awards 
the fair value of stock option awards is determined by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
for restricted stock awards with market conditions  the fair value of the awards is measured using the asset or nothing option pricing model 
restricted stock awards without market 
table of contents conditions and the performance based awards are valued using the market price of our common stock on the grant date 
we record compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  for stock based compensation awards over the requisite service period except for performance based awards 
for performance based awards  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period as and when we determine that the achievement of the performance condition is probable  using the per share fair value measured at grant date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risks refers to the risk of loss arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments will be entered into for purposes of risk management and not for speculation 
due to the historical volatility of commodity prices  if and when we commence production  we may enter into various derivative instruments to manage our exposure to volatility of commodity market prices 
we may use options including floors and collars and fixed price swaps to mitigate the impact of downward swings in commodity prices to our cash flow 
all contracts will be settled with cash and would not require the delivery of physical volumes to satisfy settlement 
while in times of higher commodity prices this strategy may result in our having lower net cash inflows than we would otherwise have if we had not utilized these instruments  management believes the risk reduction benefits of such a strategy would outweigh the potential costs 
we may borrow under fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments that give rise to interest rate risk 
our objective in borrowing under fixed or variable rate debt is to satisfy capital requirements while minimizing our costs of capital
