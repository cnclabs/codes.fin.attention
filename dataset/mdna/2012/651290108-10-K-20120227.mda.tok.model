table of contents 
index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development and production of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
our principal domestic areas of operation include the mid continent  the rocky mountains and onshore texas 
internationally  we focus on offshore oil developments in malaysia and china 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
prices for oil and gas fluctuate widely 
oil and gas prices affect the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  and the quantity of oil and gas that we can economically produce 
to maintain and grow our production and cash flows  we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
operational highlights 
significant operational highlights include the following in may  we closed two separate transactions in the central basin north and adjacent to monument butte for approximately million and added approximately  net acres  giving us interest in approximately  net acres in the uinta basin  in late and early  we announced two separate  long term agreements and years  respectively with area refiners adding  bopd of refining capacity beginning in and  by year end  we had assembled more than  net acres in the oily cana woodford play  located in the anadarko basin  and production commenced in late from two new offshore developments in malaysia east piatu and puteri  which are now providing combined net production of approximately  boepd as of february  financial highlights 
significant financial highlights include the following for  we had revenues of billion  higher than  for  we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  production for the full year of was bcfe  an increase of over production volumes  oil and liquids production grew more than over levels and comprised of our total production  at year end  our proved reserves were tcfe and probable reserves were tcfe  which reflects growth of and  respectively  over the prior year  during  our proved oil reserves increased nearly and proved natural gas reserves declined by when compared to year end  our oil liftings in the fourth quarter of were million barrels  or an average of approximately  bopd  which is approximately  bopd higher than the third quarter of and approximately higher than the fourth quarter of  and during  we monetized approximately million in sales of non strategic assets and executed contracts to monetize an additional million

index to financial statements results of operations revenues 
all of our revenues are derived from the sale of our oil and gas production and do not include the effects of the settlements of our hedges 
please see note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold 
in addition  substantially all of the crude oil from our operations offshore malaysia and china is produced into fpsos and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated 
revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold  not when it is produced into the fpso 
as a result  the timing of liftings may impact period to period results 
revenues of billion for were higher than approximately half of the increase in revenue for was due to higher average realized oil prices and half of the increase resulted from increased oil production 
revenues of billion for were higher than for  approximately of the revenue increase was due to higher average realized oil and gas prices  related to increased oil production and the remainder resulted from increased natural gas production

our total oil and condensate average realized price would have been  and per bbl for  and  respectively 
domestic production 
our domestic oil and gas production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  increased over production primarily due to increased production of in our rocky mountain and mid continent divisions as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts  partially offset by production decreases in our onshore gulf coast and gulf of mexico deepwater divisions due to natural field decline and weather and equipment related delays 
our domestic oil and gas production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  increased over production primarily due to increased production of bcfe in our mid continent division as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts  combined with increased production of bcfe as a result of the further development of our gulf of mexico deepwater discoveries 
international production 
our international oil production increased over levels primarily due to an increase in production of in malaysia as a result of new field developments on pm and pm and the timing of liftings 
our international oil production decreased slightly from levels primarily due to the timing of liftings from our oil production in malaysia 
operating expenses 
we believe the most informative way to analyze changes in our operating expenses from period to period is on a unit of production  or per mcfe  basis

the increase in domestic loe per mcfe resulted from a per mcfe increase in the normally recurring portion of our loe 
recurring loe in our rocky mountain division accounted for approximately of the increase due to increased water handling and overall operating and service related costs in the basins in which we operate 
in addition  loe increased per mcfe due to increased transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts in our mid continent division throughout production and other taxes per mcfe increased due to a increase in realized oil prices during  coupled with a increase in oil and natural gas production subject to production taxes

capitalized interest increased in as compared to due to an increase in the average balance of unproved properties primarily as a result of the maverick basin asset acquisition in february commodity derivative income 
the significant fluctuations in commodity derivative income from period to period are due to the significant volatility of oil and gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these periods 
taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory tax rate due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits  state income taxes and the differences between international and us federal statutory rates 
our effective tax rate generally approximates 
our effective tax rate for was impacted by the release of the valuation allowance related to the malaysia tax benefit recorded in estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and gas prices  the timing  amount  and location of future production and future operating expenses and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources we must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows 
we accomplish this through successful drilling programs and property acquisitions 
these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
lower prices for oil and gas may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce  and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as further described below 
we establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year 
our capital budgets excluding acquisitions are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash  primarily cash flows from operations 
approximately of our expected domestic oil and gas production excluding ngls supporting the current capital budget is hedged 
our capital budget  excluding capitalized interest and overhead of million  is approximately to billion and focuses on projects with higher return on investment and which we believe generate and lay the foundation for oil production growth in and thereafter 
substantially all of the budget is allocated to oil or liquids rich projects 
actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil and gas prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired 
in addition  in the past  we often have increased our capital budget during the year as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
we continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in may  we closed two transactions to acquire assets in the uinta basin of utah for a total of approximately million 
the acquisitions were funded with borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we received proceeds from the sale of certain non strategic assets of approximately million 
we used the proceeds from these sales to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
in september  we sold million of senior notes due and received proceeds of million net of discount and offering costs 
these notes were issued at of par to yield 
we used the net proceeds to repay a portion of our then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and money market lines of credit 
we continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of million 
we attempt to sell these securities every days until the auctions succeed  the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature 
we currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent or that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements 
see note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information regarding the auction rate securities 
credit arrangements 
in june  we entered into a new revolving credit facility that matures in june and provides for loan commitments of billion from a syndicate of financial institutions  led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  as agent 
as of december   the largest individual commitment by any lender was of total commitments 
in addition  subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in our credit facility  we also have a total of million of borrowing capacity under money market lines of credit with various financial institutions  the availability of which is at the discretion of the financial institutions 
for a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements  please see note  debt  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
at february   we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility 
in addition  we had no outstanding borrowings under either our credit facility or our money market lines of credit 
our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately billion as of february  working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements and changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments 
without the effects of commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
although we anticipate that our capital spending excluding acquisitions will correspond with our anticipated cash flows from operations and property sales proceeds  we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangements throughout the year since the timing of expenditures and the receipt of cash flows from operations do not necessarily match 
at december  and  we had negative working capital of million and million  respectively 
the changes in our working capital are primarily a result of the timing of the collection of receivables  drilling activities  payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations 
cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations are primarily affected by production and commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital 
we sell substantially all of our oil and gas production under floating price market sensitive contracts 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months 
see oil and gas hedging below 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within days of production 
as a result  cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate  but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by dd a  ceiling test writedowns  other impairments or other non cash charges or credits 
our net cash flows from operations were approximately billion in  and our working capital requirements change each year as a result of the timing of drilling activities  receivable collections from purchasers and joint interest partners  payments made by us to vendors and other operators  the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations and the change in net cash receipts on derivative settlements 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was billion compared to billion for during  we spent billion primarily for additions to oil and gas properties including million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  received proceeds of million from sales of non strategic oil and gas assets  and redeemed investments of million

includes non cancellable agreements for office space and cancellable agreements for drilling rigs and other equipment  as well as certain service contracts 
the majority of these obligations are related to contracts for hydraulic well fracturing services and drilling rigs and are included at the gross contractual value 
due to our various working interests where these service contracts will be utilized  it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation 
net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration  development and production activities 
we have work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic data  natural gas transportation and fulfilling other related commitments 
at december   these work related commitments totaled million  all of which were attributable to our international business 
actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted 
we have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations 
given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions  we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments

table of contents 
index to financial statements commitments under joint operating agreements 
most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
oil and gas hedging as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
all of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty  and we have netting arrangements with all of our counterparties that provide for offsetting payables against receivables from separate hedging arrangements with that counterparty 
at december   barclays bank plc  morgan stanley capital group inc  jpmorgan chase bank  na  bank of montreal  j aron company and societe generale were the counterparties with respect to approximately of our future hedged production  none of which were counterparty to more than of our future hedged production 
a significant number of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements are also lenders under our credit facility 
our credit facility  senior notes  senior subordinated notes and substantially all of our hedging arrangements contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and hedging instruments in certain situations 
substantially all of our hedging transactions are settled based upon reported settlement prices on the nymex 
historically  a majority of our hedged oil and gas production has been sold at market prices that have had a high positive correlation to the settlement price for such hedges 
the price that we receive for natural gas production from the gulf of mexico and onshore gulf coast  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically averages per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 
realized natural gas prices for our mid continent properties  after basis differentials  transportation and handling charges  typically average of the henry hub index 
in the rocky mountains  we hedged basis associated with approximately bcf of our natural gas production from january through december to lock in the differential at a weighted average of per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 
in total  this hedge and the  mmbtus per day we have sold on a fixed physical basis for the same period results in an average basis hedge of per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 
in the mid continent  we have hedged basis associated with approximately bcf of our anticipated natural gas production from the stiles britt ranch area for the period january through december at an average of per mmbtu less than the henry hub index 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the price we receive for our gulf coast oil production  excluding ngls  typically averages about of the nymex west texas intermediate wti price 
the price we receive for our oil production in the rocky mountains  excluding ngls  is currently averaging about per barrel below the wti price 
oil production from our mid continent properties  excluding ngls  typically averages of the wti price 
crude oil from our operations in malaysia typically sells at a slight discount to tapis  or about of wti 
crude oil from our operations in china typically sells at per barrel greater than the wti price 
accounting for hedging activities 
we do not designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because hedges not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis with changes in fair value reported in current earnings  we have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience  significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
as of december   we had net derivative assets of million  of which was measured based upon our valuation model ie black scholes  and  as such  are classified as a level fair value measurement 
we value these contracts using a model that considers various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c volatility factors  d counterparty credit risk and e current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments 
we utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties 
please see critical accounting policies and estimates commodity derivative activities below and note  derivative financial instruments  and note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance liquidity and capital resource positions  or for any other purpose 
however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with the audit committee of our board of directors 
see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into four categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates 
table of contents 
index to financial statements quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company 
accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions 
stock based compensation cost requires estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards  the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments 
oil and gas activities 
accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  costs in effect at year end and a discount rate 
on december   the sec issued modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule 
the final rule adopted revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on forms k for years ending on or after december  on january   the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures asu  which aligned the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of fasb accounting standards codification topic  extractive industries oil and gas topic  with the requirements in the sec s final rule 
we adopted the final rule and asu effective december  the following critical accounting policies and estimates discussions reflect the new rules unless stated otherwise 
see new accounting requirements below for a full discussion 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our oil and gas activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties  plus an estimate of our future development costs  are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities

index to financial statements proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials and under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of dd a expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
to change our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately  or bcfe 
to change our malaysia dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in malaysia of approximately  or bcfe 
since production from our china operations is immaterial  any change in the dd a rate as a result of changes in our proved reserves in china would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if net capitalized costs exceed the applicable cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  it would reduce earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and result in lower dd a expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
the ceiling value of oil and gas reserves is calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter 
the full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting  if any 
at december   the ceiling value of our oil and gas reserves was calculated based on the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
using these prices  the ceiling exceeded the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties by approximately billion net of tax at december  holding all other factors constant  if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months for both oil and gas were to decline approximately from prices used at december   the excess of our domestic cost center ceiling over our capitalized costs would be reduced by approximately 
at december   the malaysia and china cost center ceilings exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax 
holding all other factors constant  it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in malaysia and china if the applicable unweighted average first day of the month oil price declined approximately and  respectively  from prices used at december  
table of contents 
index to financial statements at march   prior to our adoption of the final rule and asu  the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon quoted period end market prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel for oil  adjusted for market differentials 
using these prices  the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties at march  exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately billion million  after tax  resulting in a ceiling test writedown 
given the fluctuation of oil and gas prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term 
if the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months decline  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
costs withheld from amortization 
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and seismic data  wells currently being drilled and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
in addition  a portion of the incurred if not previously included in the amortization base and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization 
to qualify  a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development eg  the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled 
incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work 
any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   we had a total of approximately billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools 
the application of the full cost ceiling test at december  resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each full cost pool 
holding all other factors constant  inclusion of approximately of our domestic unevaluated property costs in the amortization base would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
including all of our malaysian unevaluated property costs in our malaysia amortization base would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown 
at december   there were no costs withheld from the amortization base in china 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location  type of production structure  water depth  reservoir depth and characteristics  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates are revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
to change our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately  or million 
to change our malaysia dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in malaysia of approximately  or million 
since production from our china operations is immaterial  any change in the dd a rate as a result of changes in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in china would not have materially affected our consolidated results of operations 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations 
as part of our growth strategy  we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we are required to record the excess as an asset called goodwill 
as the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments  the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain 
the value allocated to recoverable oil and gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under full cost ceiling limitation above 
the accounting for business combinations changed effective january  and established how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition  measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction 
the standard applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december  we adopted the standard effective january  since adoption of the standard  the assets we have acquired have not met the requirements to be accounted for as a business combination 
commodity derivative activities 
we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and gas production for the next months 
in the case of acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
under accounting rules  we may elect to designate those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
since late  we have not designated future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we are likely to experience significant non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts  we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative 
our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c volatility factors  d counterparty credit risk and e current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  
table of contents 
index to financial statements as well as other relevant economic measures 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
we periodically validate our valuations using independent third party quotations 
the determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements such as cash deposits  letters of credit and priority interests 
we utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties 
stock based compensation 
we apply a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
for equity based compensation awards  compensation expense is based on the fair value on the date of grant or modification and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice based model for our performance and market based restricted stock 
additionally  in  we granted cash settled restricted units that are accounted for under the liability method which require newfield to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period 
see note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a full discussion of our stock based compensation 
new accounting requirements in april  the fasb issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurements and impairments of securities which made fair value measurements more consistent with fair value principles  enhanced consistency in financial reporting by increasing the frequency of fair value disclosures  and provided greater clarity and consistency in accounting for and presenting impairment losses on securities 
the additional guidance was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  we adopted the provisions for the period ended march  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
although there is new terminology  the guidance was based on the same principles as those that previously existed 
this guidance was effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  our adoption of these provisions beginning with the period ended june  did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
on december   the sec issued the modernization of oil and gas reporting final rule 
the final rule adopted revisions to the sec s oil and gas reporting disclosure requirements and was effective for annual reports on form k for years ending on or after december  the revisions were intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves to help investors evaluate their investments in oil and gas companies 
the amendments were also designed to modernize the oil and gas disclosure requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology 
on january   the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures asu  which aligned the fasb s oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements with the requirements in the sec s final rule 
we adopted the final rule and asu effective december  as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate 
such a change was accounted for prospectively under the authoritative accounting guidance 
comparative disclosures applying the new rules for periods before the adoption of asu and the final rule were not required 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our adoption of asu and the final rule on december  impacted our financial statements and other disclosures in our annual report on form k for the years ended december   and  as follows all oil and gas reserves volumes presented as of and for the years ended december   and were prepared using the updated reserves rules and are not on a basis comparable with the prior period 
this change in comparability occurred because we estimated our proved reserves at december   and using the updated reserves rules  which require use of the unweighted average first day of the month commodity prices for the prior twelve months  adjusted for market differentials  and permits the use of reliable technologies to support reserve estimates 
under the previous reserve estimation rules  which are no longer in effect  our net proved oil and gas reserves would have been calculated using end of period oil and gas prices 
our full cost ceiling test calculations at december   and used discounted cash flow models for our estimated proved reserves  which were calculated using the updated reserves rules 
we historically have applied a policy of using our year end proved reserves to calculate our fourth quarter depletion rate 
as a result  the estimate of proved reserves for determining our depletion rate and resulting expense for the fourth quarter of and subsequent quarters is not on a basis comparable to the prior quarters or the prior years 
on april   the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 accounting for extractive industries oil and gas asu  which aligned the oil and gas financial accounting and reporting requirements prescribed by fasb accounting standards codification topic  extractive industries oil and gas topic with the requirements in the sec s final rule 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued additional disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
the guidance requires disclosure of transfers of assets and liabilities between level and level in the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons for the transfers and disclosure of major purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured under level of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
the guidance was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   except for the level reconciliation disclosures  which were effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted the provisions for the quarter ended march   except for the level reconciliation disclosures  which we adopted for the quarter ended march  adopting the disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the most significant change will require us  for level fair value measurements  to disclose quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we do not expect adoption of the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
the guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
the guidance is retrospective and is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we elected early adoption of the provision for the year ended december  adopting the reporting requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

regulation exploration and development and the production and sale of oil and gas are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations 
an overview of these regulations is set forth in items and  business and properties regulation 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  current regulatory requirements may change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil and gas prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil and gas prices as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use also may limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
all of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties  which generally are financial institutions  will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see the information under the caption oil and gas hedging in item of this report and the discussion and tables in note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  which is incorporated herein by reference
