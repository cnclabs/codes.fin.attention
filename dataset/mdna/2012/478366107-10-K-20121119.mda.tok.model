item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations 
adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax reserves on our statement of financial position that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
additionally  changes in tax laws in the us or in other countries where we have significant operations could materially affect deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated statement of financial position and tax expense 
we are also subject to tax audits by governmental authorities in the us and in us jurisdictions 
negative unexpected results from one or more such tax audits could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents legal proceedings in which we are  or may be  a party may adversely affect us 
we are currently and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and commercial or contractual disputes 
these are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including  without limitation  commercial or contractual disputes with our suppliers  intellectual property matters  third party liability  including product liability claims and employment claims 
there exists the possibility that such claims may have an adverse impact on our results of operations that is greater than we anticipate 
an investigation by the european commission ec related to european lead recyclers procurement practices is currently underway  with the company one of several named companies subject to review 
the company cannot predict the ultimate financial impact  as the investigation is at a very preliminary stage 
we will continue to cooperate with the ec in their investigation and monitor related commercial and financial implications  if any 
the company s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and  if a violation of any such laws is found  to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry 
competition and antitrust law investigations may continue for several years and can result in substantial fines depending on the gravity and duration of the violations 
a downgrade in the ratings of our debt could restrict our ability to access the debt capital markets and increase our interest costs 
changes in the ratings that rating agencies assign to our debt may ultimately impact our access to the debt capital markets and the costs we incur to borrow funds 
if ratings for our debt fall below investment grade  our access to the debt capital markets would become restricted 
tightening in the credit markets and the reduced level of liquidity in many financial markets due to turmoil in the financial and banking industries could affect our access to the debt capital markets or the price we pay to issue debt 
historically  we have relied on our ability to issue commercial paper rather than to draw on our credit facility to support our daily operations  which means that a downgrade in our ratings or continued volatility in the financial markets causing limitations to the debt capital markets could have an adverse effect on our business or our ability to meet our liquidity needs 
additionally  several of our credit agreements generally include an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded 
further  an increase in the level of our indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing 
we are subject to potential insolvency or financial distress of third parties 
we are exposed to the risk that third parties to various arrangements who owe us money or goods and services  or who purchase goods and services from us  will not be able to perform their obligations or continue to place orders due to insolvency or financial distress 
if third parties fail to perform their obligations under arrangements with us  we may be forced to replace the underlying commitment at current or above market prices or on other terms that are less favorable to us 
in such events  we may incur losses  or our results of operations  financial position or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 
we may be unable to complete or integrate acquisitions effectively  which may adversely affect our growth  profitability and results of operations 
we expect acquisitions of businesses and assets to play a role in our future growth 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets  obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms  successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses 
additionally  we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies 
competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise  thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions 
we are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior 
these and other acquisition related factors may negatively and adversely impact our growth  profitability and results of operations 
we are subject to business continuity risks associated with centralization of certain administrative functions 
we have been and are in the process of regionally centralizing certain administrative functions  primarily in north america  europe and asia  to improve efficiency and reduce costs 
to the extent that these central locations are disrupted or disabled  key business processes  such as invoicing  payments and general management operations  could be interrupted 

table of contents a failure of our information technology it infrastructure could adversely impact our business and operations 
we rely upon the capacity  reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business 
for example  we are implementing new enterprise resource planning and other it systems in certain of our businesses over a period of several years 
as we implement the new systems  they may not perform as expected 
we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades 
if we experience a problem with the functioning of an important it system or a security breach of our it systems  the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business 
we and certain of our third party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business 
despite our implementation of security measures  our it systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses  natural disasters  unauthorized access  cyber attack and other similar disruptions 
any system failure  accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations 
a material network breach in the security of our it systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets 
to the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data  or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential information  it could cause significant damage to our reputation  affect our relationships with our customers  lead to claims against the company and ultimately harm our business 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future 
our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire  retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce 
failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan 
any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
building efficiency risks failure to comply with regulations due to our contracts with us government entities could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
our building efficiency business contracts with government entities and is subject to specific rules  regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors 
we are subject to routine audits by the defense contract audit agency to assure our compliance with these requirements 
our failure to comply with these or other laws and regulations could result in contract terminations  suspension or debarment from contracting with the us federal government  civil fines and damages and criminal prosecution 
in addition  changes in procurement policies  budget considerations  unexpected us developments  such as terrorist attacks  or similar political developments or events abroad that may change the us federal government s national security defense posture may affect sales to government entities 
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 
increases in commodity costs negatively impact the profitability of orders in backlog as prices on those orders are fixed  therefore  in the short term we cannot adjust for changes in commodity prices 
if we are not able to recover commodity cost increases through price increases to our customers on new orders  then such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
additionally  unfavorability in our hedging programs during a period of declining commodity prices could result in lower margins as we reduce prices to match the market on a fixed commodity cost level 
conditions in the residential and commercial new construction markets may adversely affect our results of operations 
hvac equipment sales in the residential and commercial new construction markets correlate to the number of new homes and buildings that are built 
the strength of the residential and commercial markets depends in part on the availability of consumer and commercial financing for our customers  along with inventory and pricing of existing homes and buildings 
if economic and credit market conditions worsen  it may result in a decline in the residential 
table of contents housing construction market and construction of new commercial buildings 
such conditions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and result in potential liabilities or additional costs  including impairment charges 
a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our building efficiency business 
any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our building efficiency business loss of  changes in  or failure to perform under facility management supply contracts or other guaranteed performance contracts with our major customers  cancellation of  or significant delays in  projects in our backlog  delays or difficulties in new product development  the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies  financial instability or market declines of our major component suppliers  the unavailability of raw materials primarily steel  copper and electronic components necessary for production of hvac equipment  price increases of limited source components  products and services that we are unable to pass on to the market  unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world  changes in energy costs or governmental regulations that would decrease the incentive for customers to update or improve their building control systems  revisions to energy efficiency legislation  a decline in the outsourcing of facility management services  availability of labor to support growth of our service businesses  and natural or man made disasters or losses that impact our ability to deliver facility management and other products and services to our customers 
automotive experience risks conditions in the automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial performance depends  in part  on conditions in the automotive industry 
in fiscal  our largest customers globally were automobile manufacturers ford motor company ford  daimler ag and general motors corporation gm 
if automakers experience a decline in the number of new vehicle sales  we may experience reductions in orders from these customers  incur write offs of accounts receivable  incur impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions beyond our current restructuring plans  particularly if any of the automakers cannot adequately fund their operations or experience financial distress 
uncertainty related to the economic conditions in europe may adversely affect our results of operations 
automakers across europe are experiencing difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit markets 
as a result  we have experienced and may continue to experience reductions in orders from these oem customers 
a prolonged downturn in the european automotive industry or a significant change in product mix due to consumer demand could require us to shut down additional plants or result in additional impairment charges  restructuring actions or changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
continued uncertainty relating to the economic conditions in europe may continue to have an adverse impact on our business 
financial distress of the automotive supply chain could harm our results of operations 
automotive industry conditions could adversely affect the original equipment supplier base 
lower production levels for key customers  increases in certain raw material  commodity and energy costs and global credit market conditions could result in financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base 
financial distress within the supplier base may lead to commercial disputes and possible supply chain interruptions  which in turn could disrupt our production 
in addition  an adverse industry environment may require us to provide financial support to distressed suppliers or take other measures to ensure uninterrupted production  which could involve additional costs or risks 
if any of these risks materialize  we are likely to incur losses  or our results of operations  financial position or liquidity could otherwise be adversely affected 
change in consumer demand may adversely affect our results of operations 
increases in energy costs or other factors eg  climate change concerns may shift consumer demand away from motor vehicles that typically have higher interior content that we supply  such as light trucks  cross over vehicles  minivans and suvs  to smaller vehicles having less interior content 
the loss of business with respect to  or a lack of commercial success of  one or more particular vehicle models for which we are a significant supplier could reduce our sales and harm our profitability  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully negotiate pricing terms with our customers in the automotive experience business  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we negotiate sales prices annually with our automotive customers 
cost cutting initiatives that our customers have adopted generally result in increased downward pressure on pricing 
in some cases our customer supply agreements require reductions in component pricing over the period of production 
if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in particular  large commercial settlements with our customers may adversely affect our results of operations or cause our financial results to vary on a quarterly basis 
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 
commodity prices can be volatile from year to year 
if commodity prices rise  and if we are not able to recover these cost increases from our customers  these increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the cyclicality of original equipment automobile production rates may adversely affect the results of operations in our automotive experience business 
our automotive experience business is directly related to automotive production by our customers 
automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors  including consumer spending and preferences 
an economic decline that results in a reduction in automotive production by our automotive experience customers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our automotive experience business 
any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our automotive experience business the loss of  or changes in  automobile supply contracts or sourcing strategies with our major customers or suppliers  start up expenses associated with new vehicle programs or delays or cancellations of such programs  underutilization of our manufacturing facilities  which are generally located near  and devoted to  a particular customer s facility  inability to recover engineering and tooling costs  market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on products that we have supplied  delays or difficulties in new product development  quantity and complexity of new program launches  which are subject to our customers timing  performance  design and quality standards  interruption of supply of certain single source components  the potential introduction of similar or superior technologies  changing nature of our joint ventures and relationships with our strategic business partners  and global overcapacity and vehicle platform proliferation 
power solutions risks we face competition and pricing pressure from other companies in the power solutions business 
our power solutions business competes with a number of major domestic and international manufacturers and distributors of lead acid batteries  as well as a large number of smaller  regional competitors 
the north american  european and asian lead acid battery markets are highly competitive 
the manufacturers in these markets compete on price  quality  technical innovation  service and warranty 
if we are unable to remain competitive and maintain market share in the regions and markets we serve  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations 
lead is a major component of our lead acid batteries  and the price of lead may be highly volatile 
we attempt to manage the impact of changing lead prices through the recycling of used batteries returned to us by our aftermarket customers  commercial terms and commodity hedging programs 
our ability to mitigate the impact of lead price changes can be impacted by many factors  including customer negotiations  inventory level fluctuations and sales volume mix changes  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
additionally  the prices of other commodities  primarily fuel  acid  resin and tin  may be volatile 
if other commodity prices rise  and if we are not able to recover these cost increases through price increases to our customers  such increases will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  the implementation of any price increases to our customers could negatively impact demand for our products 

table of contents decreased demand from our customers in the automotive industry may adversely affect our results of operations 
our financial performance in the power solutions business depends  in part  on conditions in the automotive industry 
sales to oems accounted for approximately of the total sales of the power solutions business in fiscal declines in the north american and european automotive production levels could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  if any oems reach a point where they cannot fund their operations  we may incur write offs of accounts receivable  incur impairment charges or require additional restructuring actions beyond our current restructuring plans 
a variety of other factors could adversely affect the results of operations of our power solutions business 
any of the following could materially and adversely impact the results of operations of our power solutions business loss of  or changes in  automobile battery supply contracts with our large original equipment and aftermarket customers  the increasing quality and useful life of batteries or use of alternative battery technologies  both of which may contribute to a growth slowdown in the lead acid battery market  delays or cancellations of new vehicle programs  market and financial consequences of any recalls that may be required on our products  delays or difficulties in new product development  including lithium ion technology  impact of potential increases in lithium ion battery volumes on established lead acid battery volumes as lithium ion battery technology grows and costs become more competitive  financial instability or market declines of our customers or suppliers  interruption of supply of certain single source components  changing nature of our joint ventures and relationships with our strategic business partners  unseasonable weather conditions in various parts of the world  increasing global environmental and safety regulations related to the manufacturing and recycling of lead acid batteries  and transportation of battery materials  our ability to secure sufficient tolling capacity to recycle batteries  price and availability of battery cores used in recycling  and the lack of the development of a market for hybrid and electric vehicles

item legal proceedings as noted in item  liabilities potentially arise globally under various environmental laws and worker safety laws for activities that are not in compliance with such laws and for the cleanup of sites where company related substances have been released into the environment 
currently  the company is responding to allegations that it is responsible for performing environmental remediation  or for the repayment of costs spent by governmental entities or others performing remediation  at approximately sites in the united states 
many of these sites are landfills used by the company in the past for the disposal of waste materials  others are secondary lead smelters and lead recycling sites where the company returned lead containing materials for recycling  a few involve the cleanup of company manufacturing facilities  and the remaining fall into miscellaneous categories 
the company may face similar claims of liability at additional sites in the future 
where potential liabilities are alleged  the company pursues a course of action intended to mitigate them 

table of contents the company accrues for potential environmental liabilities in a manner consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  that is  when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
reserves for environmental liabilities totaled million and million at september  and  respectively 
the company reviews the status of its environmental sites on a quarterly basis and adjusts its reserves accordingly 
such potential liabilities accrued by the company do not take into consideration possible recoveries of future insurance proceeds 
they do  however  take into account the likely share other parties will bear at remediation sites 
it is difficult to estimate the company s ultimate level of liability at many remediation sites due to the large number of other parties that may be involved  the complexity of determining the relative liability among those parties  the uncertainty as to the nature and scope of the investigations and remediation to be conducted  the uncertainty in the application of law and risk assessment  the various choices and costs associated with diverse technologies that may be used in corrective actions at the sites  and the often quite lengthy periods over which eventual remediation may occur 
nevertheless  the company does not currently believe that any claims  penalties or costs in connection with known environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the company has identified asset retirement obligations for environmental matters that are expected to be addressed at the retirement  disposal  removal or abandonment of existing owned facilities  primarily in the power solutions business 
at september  and  the company recorded conditional asset retirement obligations of million and million  respectively 
the company is involved in a number of product liability and various other casualty lawsuits incident to the operation of its businesses 
the company maintains insurance coverages and records estimated costs for claims and suits of this nature 
it is management s opinion that none of these will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
costs related to such matters were not material to the periods presented
