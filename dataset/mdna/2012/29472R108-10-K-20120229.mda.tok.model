the company s revenue streams are predominantly derived from customers renting its sites on a long term basis 
the company has approximately  annual sites  approximately  seasonal sites  which are leased to customers generally for three to six months  and approximately  transient sites  occupied by customers who lease sites on a short term basis 
the revenue from seasonal and transient sites is generally higher during the first and third quarters 
the company expects to service over  customers at its transient sites and the company considers this revenue stream to be its most volatile as it is subject to weather conditions  gas prices  and other factors affecting the marginal rv customer s vacation and travel preferences

the company currently expects its core community base rental income to increase approximately as compared to the company has already notified of its community site customers of rent increases reflecting this revenue growth 
the company believes that the disruption in the site built housing market is contributing to the low new home sales volumes it is experiencing as potential customers are not able to sell their existing site built homes 
customers have also become more price sensitive  which is reflected in an increase in used home sale volumes 
in this environment  the company believes that customer demand for rentals  which do not require a down payment  is high 
the company is adapting to this by renting its vacant new homes 
this may represent an attractive source of occupancy if the company can convert renters to new homebuyers in the future 
the company is also focusing on smaller  more energy efficient and more affordable homes in its manufactured home properties 
the company s manufactured home rental operations have been increasing since for the year ended december   occupied manufactured home rentals increased to  or  from for the year ended december  net operating income increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the company believes that unlike the home sales business  at this time the company competes effectively with other types of rentals ie apartments

in the company s resort properties  the company continues to work on extending customer stays 
the company has had success lengthening customer stays

see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january   the purchase price of properties is determined in accordance the codification topic business combinations fasb asc 
table of contents which requires the company to recognize all the assets acquired and all the liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
the company also expenses transaction costs as they are incurred 
certain purchase price adjustments may be made within one year following any acquisition and applied retroactively to the date of acquisition 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  the company utilizes a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market data 
the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company generally uses a year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural and land improvements including site development  a ten year estimated life for building upgrades and a five year estimated life for furniture  fixtures and equipment and a one year life applied for acquired in place leases 
new rental units are generally depreciated using a year estimated life from each model year down to a salvage value of of the original costs 
used rental units are generally depreciated based on the estimated life of the unit with no estimated salvage value 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred  and significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful life 
the values of above and below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase in the case of below market leases or a decrease in the case of above market leases to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease 
the value associated with in place leases is amortized over the expected term  which includes an estimated probability of lease renewal 
the company accounts for its properties held for disposition in accordance with the codification sub topic impairment or disposal of long lived assets fasb asc 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets to be held and used  including its investments in real estate  for impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
for long lived assets to be held and used  if an impairment indicator exists  the company compares the expected future undiscounted cash flows against the carrying amount of that asset 
if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  the company would record an impairment loss if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
for properties to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time the company has made a decision to dispose of the property  has a commitment to sell the property and or is actively marketing the property for sale 
a property to be disposed of is reported at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition  depreciation expense is not recorded in accordance with fasb asc accordingly  the results of operations for all assets sold or held for sale have been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
revenue recognition the company accounts for leases with its customers as operating leases 
rental income is recognized over the term of the respective lease or the length of a customer s stay  the majority of which are for a term of not 
table of contents greater than one year 
the company will reserve for receivables when it believes the ultimate collection is less than probable 
the company s provision for uncollectible rents receivable was approximately million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the company accounts for the upfront payment related to the entry or upgrade of right to use contracts in accordance with the codification topic revenue recognition fasb asc 
a right to use contract gives the customer the right to a set schedule of usage at a specified group of properties 
customers may choose to upgrade their contracts to increase their usage and the number of properties they may access 
a contract requires the customer to make annual payments during the term of the contract and may require an upfront nonrefundable payment 
the stated term of a right to use contract is at least one year and the customer may renew his contract by continuing to make the annual payments 
the company will recognize the upfront non refundable payments over the estimated customer life which  based on historical attrition rates  the company has estimated to be from one to years 
for example  the company has currently estimated that of customers who enter a new right to use contract will terminate their contract after five years 
therefore  the upfront nonrefundable payments from of the contracts entered in any particular period are amortized on a straight line basis over a period of five years as five years is the estimated customer life for of the company s customers who enter a contract 
the historical attrition rates for upgrade contracts are lower than for new contracts  and therefore  the nonrefundable upfront payments for upgrade contracts are amortized at a different rate than for new contracts 
the decision to recognize this revenue in accordance with fasb asc was made after corresponding during september and october of with the office of the chief accountant at the sec 
right to use annual payments by customers under the terms of the right to use contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the one year period in which the services are provided 
income from home sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete 
the earnings process is complete when the home has been delivered  the purchaser has accepted the home and title has transferred 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the codification topic stock compensation fasb asc 
the company uses the black scholes merton formula to estimate the value of stock options granted to employees  consultants and directors 
non controlling interests in december  the fasb issued the codification topic consolidation  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
fasb asc 
fasb asc seeks to improve uniformity and transparency in reporting of the net income attributable to non controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements of the reporting entity 
the statement requires  among other provisions  the disclosure  clear labeling and presentation of non controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
per fasb asc  a non controlling interest is the portion of equity net assets in a subsidiary not attributable  directly or indirectly  to a parent 
the ownership interests in the subsidiary that are held by owners other than the parent are non controlling interests 
under fasb asc  such non controlling interests are reported on the consolidated balance sheets within equity  separately from the company s equity 
however  securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets at the option of the holder  not solely within the control of the issuer  must be classified outside of permanent equity 
this would result in certain outside ownership interests being included as redeemable non controlling interests outside of permanent equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company makes this determination based on terms in applicable agreements  specifically in relation to redemption provisions 
additionally  with respect to non controlling interests for which the company has a choice to settle the contract by delivery of its own shares  the company considered the guidance in the codification topic derivatives and hedging contracts in entity s own equity fasb asc to evaluate whether it controls the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under share settlement of the contract 

table of contents in accordance with fasb asc  the company presents the non controlling interest for common op units in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the caption common op units on the consolidated balance sheets also includes million of private reit subsidiaries preferred stock 
the company s perpetual preferred op units are presented in the mezzanine section on the consolidated balance sheets 
notes receivable during the year ended december   the company purchased chattel loans that were recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition under the codification topic loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality fasb asc 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this form k for a detailed description of our recent acquisition 
the fair value of these chattel loans includes an estimate of losses that are expected to be incurred over the estimated remaining lives of the receivables  and therefore no allowance for losses was recorded for these chattel loans as of the transaction date 
the fair value is estimated based on a number of factors including customer delinquency status  fico scores  the original down payment amount and below market stated interest rates 
through december   the credit performance of these chattel loans has generally been consistent with the assumptions used in determining its initial fair value  and the company s original expectations regarding the amounts and timing of future cash flows has not changed 
a probable decrease in management s expectation of future cash collections related to these chattel loans could result in the need to record an allowance for credit losses in the future 
due to the size of the chattel loan pool and maturity dates ranging up to years  future credit losses or changes to interest income could be significant

inflation substantially all of the leases at the properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide the company with the opportunity to achieve increases  where justified by the market  as each lease matures 
such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the company

the company s right to use contracts generally provide for an annual dues increase  but dues may be frozen under the terms of certain contracts if the customer is over years old 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is a non gaap financial measure 
the company believes ffo  as defined by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is 
table of contents generally an appropriate measure of performance for an equity reit 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity reits  it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap  and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance 
the company defines ffo as net income  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company receives up front non refundable payments from the entry of right to use contracts 
in accordance with gaap  the upfront non refundable payments and related commissions are deferred and amortized over the estimated customer life 
although the nareit definition of ffo does not address the treatment of nonrefundable right to use payments  the company believes that it is appropriate to adjust for the impact of the deferral activity in its calculation of ffo 
the company believes that ffo is helpful to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity reit 
the company further believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or actual or estimated losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
the company believes that the adjustment to ffo for the net revenue deferral of upfront non refundable payments and expense deferral of right to use contract commissions also facilitates the comparison to other equity reits 
investors should review ffo  along with gaap net income and cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  when evaluating an equity reit s operating performance 
the company computes ffo in accordance with its interpretation of standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company does 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap  nor does it represent cash available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  determined in accordance with gaap  as an indication of the company s financial performance  or to cash flow from operating activities  determined in accordance with gaap  as a measure of its liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
the following table presents a calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands computation of funds from operations net income available for common shares income allocated to common op units series b redeemable preferred stock dividends right to use contract upfront payments  deferred  net right to use contract commissions  deferred  net depreciation on real estate assets and other amortization of in place leases depreciation on unconsolidated joint ventures loss gain on real estate funds from operations available for common shares weighted average common shares outstanding fully diluted

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the company s earnings  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates

at december  none of the company s outstanding secured debt was short term
