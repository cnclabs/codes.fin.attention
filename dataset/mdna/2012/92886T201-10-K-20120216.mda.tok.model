item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors  including the factors we describe under item a risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of communications services connecting people through broadband devices worldwide 
we rely heavily on our network  which is a flexible  scalable session initiation protocol sip based voice over internet protocol  or voip  network 
this platform enables a user via a single identity  either a number or user name  to access and utilize services and features regardless of how they are connected to the internet  including over g  g  cable  or dsl broadband networks 
this technology enables us to offer our customers attractively priced voice and messaging services and other features around the world 
in  we shifted our primary emphasis from the domestic home phone replacement market to the international long distance market 
with vonage world we offer unlimited calling domestically and to more than countries  including india  mexico  and china  for a flat monthly rate 
we believe the value and convenience provided by vonage world is particularly appealing to international long distance callers compared to offers from our competitors 
in addition to our landline telephony business  we are leveraging our technology to offer services and applications for mobile and other connected devices to address large existing markets 
we introduced our first mobile offering in late and have continued to build upon our mobile services strategy with two product introductions in mid in early  we introduced vonage mobile  our all in one mobile application that provides free calling and messaging between users who have the application  as well as low cost international calling to more than countries to any other phone 
in addition  calls by users of the mobile application to vonage home or business lines are also free 
this mobile application works over wifi  g and g and in more than countries worldwide 
vonage mobile consolidates the best features of our prior applications  while adding important functionality  better value  and improved ease of use 
vonage mobile users can instantly add calling credit from within the application through itunes or the android market for calls to users without the application 
vonage mobile uses the phone s existing mobile number and contact list  eliminating the need for unique user names and duplicate identities for contacts and allowing users to build a free global calling and messaging network from their existing contacts using the application s multiple invitation system 
we have made significant financial progress over the past four years providing a solid foundation for the future 
we have managed a significant strategic shift while transforming the cost structure in our core business to drive significant improvements in profitability 
we enhanced the value of our product by investing in upgraded systems  streamlined processes  and improved customer experience  which we believe have helped stabilize our subscriber base while driving structural cost reductions throughout the company 
in addition to reducing ongoing costs  these structural improvements enabled us to absorb incremental costs resulting from a growth in international minutes as we added new customers to our vonage world plan 
by lowering international termination costs  lowering domestic calling rates  and reducing the cost of our devices by nearly a third  we have significantly improved our profitability 
in  our core business generated substantial net income and cash flow on relatively flat service revenues  driven by an aggressive focus on driving efficiencies throughout our operations 
through two refinancings in the past months  we have reduced our debt by over and lowered interest rates from highs of to less than  saving million in annual interest expense from the debt structure in place in we had approximately million subscriber lines for broadband telephone replacement services as of december  we bill customers in the united states  canada  and the united kingdom 
customers in the united states represented of our subscriber lines at december  recent developments net deferred tax assets represent the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax return bases of our assets and liabilities 
our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards nols 
we are required to record a valuation allowance which reduces these net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from these net deferred tax assets prior to expiration 
we periodically review this conclusion  which requires significant management judgment 
until the fourth quarter of  we recorded a valuation allowance which reduced our net deferred tax assets to zero 
in the fourth quarter of  based upon our sustained profitable operating performance over the past three years excluding certain losses associated with our prior convertible notes and our december debt refinancing and our positive outlook for taxable income in the future  our evaluation determined that the benefit resulting from our net deferred tax assets namely  the nols are likely to be usable prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we released the related valuation allowance against our united states and canada net deferred tax assets  and a portion of the allowance against our state net deferred tax assets as certain nols may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states  resulting in a one time non cash income tax benefit of  that we recorded in our statement of operations and a corresponding net deferred tax asset of  that we recorded on our balance sheet on december  in subsequent periods  we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate  an expense that has not been recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance and that will reduce our net income and earnings per share 
in the future  if available evidence changes our conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  we will make an adjustment to the related valuation allowance at that time 
vonage annual report 
table of contents trends in our industry and key operating data a number of trends in our industry have a significant effect on our results of operations and are important to an understanding of our financial statements 
competitive landscape 
we face intense competition from traditional telephone companies  wireless companies  cable companies  and alternative voice communication providers 
most traditional wireline and wireless telephone service providers and cable companies are substantially larger and better capitalized than we are and have the advantage of a large existing customer base 
in addition  because our competitors provide other services  they often choose to offer voip services or other voice services as part of a bundle that includes other products  such as video  high speed internet access  and wireless telephone service  which we do not offer 
further  as wireless providers offer more minutes at lower prices  better coverage  and companion landline alternative services  their services have become more attractive to households as a replacement for wireline service 
we also compete against alternative voice communication providers  such as magicjack  skype  and google voice 
some of these service providers have chosen to sacrifice telephony revenue in order to gain market share and have offered their services at low prices or for free 
as we continue to introduce applications that integrate different forms of voice and messaging services over multiple devices  we are facing competition from emerging competitors focused on similar integration  as well as from alternative voice communication providers 
in addition  our competitors have partnered and may in the future partner with other competitors to offer products and services  leveraging their collective competitive positions 
we also are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies 
in connection with our increasing emphasis on the international long distance market  we face competition from low cost international calling cards and voip providers in addition to traditional telephone companies  cable companies  and wireless companies 
broadband adoption 
the number of united states households with broadband internet access has grown significantly 
on march   the federal communications commission fcc released its national broadband plan  which seeks  through supporting broadband deployment and programs  to encourage broadband adoption for the approximately million united states residents who do not have broadband at home 
we expect the trend of greater broadband adoption to continue 
we benefit from this trend because our service requires a broadband internet connection and our potential addressable market increases as broadband adoption increases 
regulation 
our business has developed in a relatively lightly regulated environment 
the united states and other countries  however  are examining how voip services should be regulated 
the november order by the fcc in response to a request by kansas and nebraska that permits states to impose state universal service fund obligations on voip service  discussed in note to our financial statements  is an example of efforts by regulators to determine how voip service fits into the telecommunications regulatory landscape 
in addition to regulatory matters that directly address voip  a number of other regulatory initiatives could impact our business 
one such regulatory initiative is net neutrality 
in december  the fcc adopted a revised set of net neutrality rules for broadband internet service providers 
these rules make it more difficult for broadband internet service providers to block or discriminate against vonage service 
several broadband internet service providers have filed appeals of the fcc s new rules at the dc circuit court of appeals alleging that the fcc lacks authority to apply its rules to broadband internet service providers 
in addition  on february   the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking on reforming universal service and the intercarrier compensation icc system that governs payments between telecommunications carriers primarily for terminating traffic 
the fcc s adoption of an icc proposal will impact vonage s costs for telecommunications services 
on october   the fcc adopted an order reforming universal service and icc 
the fcc order provides that voip originated calls will be subject to interstate access charges for long distance calls and reciprocal compensation for local calls that terminate to the public switched telephone network pstn 
the termination charges for all traffic  including voip originated traffic  will transition over several years to a bill and keep arrangement ie  no termination charges 
we believe that the order would positively impact our costs over time 
see also the discussion under regulation in note to our financial statements for a discussion of certain other regulatory issues that impact us 
the table below includes key operating data that our management uses to measure the growth and operating performance of our business for the years ended december  gross subscriber line additions change in net subscriber lines subscriber lines at period end average monthly customer churn average monthly revenue per line average monthly telephony services revenue per line average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line marketing costs per gross subscriber line addition employees excluding temporary help at period end gross subscriber line additions 
gross subscriber line additions for a particular period are calculated by taking the net subscriber line additions during that particular period and adding to that the number of subscriber lines that terminated during that period 
this number does not include subscriber lines both added and terminated during the period  where termination occurred within the first days after activation 
the number does include  however  subscriber lines added during the period that are terminated within days of activation but after the end of the period 
net subscriber line additions 
net subscriber line additions for a particular period reflect the number of subscriber lines at the end of the period  less the number of subscriber lines at the beginning of the period 
subscriber lines 
our subscriber lines include  as of a particular date  all paid subscriber lines from which a customer can make an outbound telephone call on that date 
our subscriber lines include fax lines and soft phones but do not include our virtual phone numbers or toll free numbers  which only allow inbound telephone calls to customers 
subscriber lines decreased by  from  as of december  vonage annual report 
table of contents to  as of december  average monthly customer churn 
average monthly customer churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of customers that terminated during that period by the simple average number of customers during the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of customers during the period is the number of customers on the first day of the period  plus the number of customers on the last day of the period  divided by two 
terminations  as used in the calculation of churn statistics  do not include customers terminated during the period if termination occurred within the first days after activation 
our average monthly customer churn increased from in to in we believe the increase in churn was primarily due to higher early life churn as a result of no longer requiring a service agreement and higher churn rates of some ethnic calling segments that we targeted 
we monitor churn on a daily basis and use it as an indicator of the level of customer satisfaction 
other companies may calculate churn differently  and their churn data may not be directly comparable to ours 
customers who have been with us for a year or more tend to have a lower churn rate than customers who have not 
our churn will fluctuate over time due to economic conditions  competitive pressures including wireless substitution  marketplace perception of our services  and our ability to provide high quality customer care and network quality and add future innovative products and services 
average monthly revenue per line 
average monthly revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period is the number of subscriber lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of subscriber lines on the last day of the period  divided by two 
our average monthly revenue per line decreased slightly to for compared to for this decrease was attributable to the elimination of equipment recovery fees and disconnect fees which were discontinued for new customers beginning september average monthly telephony services revenue per line 
average monthly telephony services revenue per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our total telephony services revenue for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
our average monthly telephony services revenue per line increased slightly from for to for this increase was due to an increase in the number of customers signing up for higher priced rate plans  selective pricing actions we implemented along with enhancements to our service  and improved customer credit quality that reduced bad debt costs 
these increases were partially offset by the elimination of disconnect fees which were discontinued for new customers beginning september and a decrease in activation fees as the historical deferred activation fees are amortized and new activation fees are no longer charged and deferred 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line 
average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line for a particular period is calculated by dividing our direct cost of telephony services for that period by the simple average number of subscriber lines for the period  and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
we use the average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line to evaluate how effective we are at managing our costs of providing service 
our average monthly direct cost of telephony services per line decreased slightly to for compared to for  due primarily to more favorable rates negotiated with our service providers  the decrease in our network costs  and the decrease in e costs 
these decreases were offset by a larger base of vonage world customers which increased international termination costs 
direct cost of telephony services both overall and on a per line basis is expected to increase in the drivers of this increase are increased international calling by our growing base of vonage world customers partially offset by next generation call routing and peering relationships we are implementing 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition 
marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition is calculated by dividing our marketing expense for a particular period by the number of gross subscriber line additions during the period 
marketing expense does not include the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions  which are accounted for as an offset to revenues  customer equipment subsidies  which are accounted for as direct cost of goods sold  or kiosk and community based events teams costs  which are accounted for as selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a result  it does not represent the full cost to us of obtaining a new customer 
our marketing cost per gross subscriber line addition decreased to for from in  as our increased marketing investment in direct mail to targeted ethnic segments yielded incremental gross subscriber line additions 
employees 
employees represent the number of personnel that are on our payroll and exclude temporary or outsourced labor 
operating revenues operating revenues consists of telephony services revenue and customer equipment and shipping revenue 
telephony services revenue 
substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenue 
in the united states  we have six residential plans  vonage world  world premium unlimited  vonage pro  us and canada unlimited  us and canada  and us and canada  two mobile plans  vonage world mobile and vonage mobile pay per use and two small office and home office calling plans  small business premium unlimited minutes and small business basic minutes 
each of our unlimited plans other than vonage world offers unlimited domestic calling as well as unlimited calling to puerto rico  canada  and selected european countries  subject to certain restrictions 
each of our basic plans offers a limited number of domestic calling minutes per month 
we also offer international calling plans that are bundled with our residential premium unlimited plan where a customer can make calls to a chosen international region 
we offer similar plans in canada and the united kingdom 
the vonage world plan  now available in the united states and canada  offers unlimited calling across the united states and puerto rico  unlimited international calling to over countries including india  mexico  and canada  subject to certain restrictions  and free voicemail to text messages with vonage visual voicemail 
under our basic plans  we charge on a per minute basis when the number of domestic calling minutes included in the plan is exceeded for a particular month 
international calls except for calls to puerto rico  canada and certain european countries under our unlimited plans and a variety of countries under international calling plans and vonage world are charged on a per minute basis 
these per minute fees are not included in our monthly subscription fees 
in addition to our landline telephony business  we are leveraging our technology to offer services and applications for mobile and other connected devices to address large existing markets 
we introduced our first mobile offering in late and have continued to build upon our mobile services strategy with two product introductions in mid in early  we introduced vonage mobile  our all in one mobile application that provides free calling and messaging between users who have the application  as well as traditional paid international calling to any other phone 
this mobile application works over wifi  g and g and in more than countries worldwide 
the application consolidates the best features of our prior applications  while adding important functionality  better value and improved ease of use including direct payment through itunes 
we derive most of our telephony services revenue from monthly subscription fees that we charge our customers under our service plans 
we also offer residential fax service  virtual phone numbers  toll free numbers and other services  and charge an additional monthly fee for each vonage annual report 
table of contents service 
one business fax line is included with each of our two small office and home office plans  but we charge monthly fees for additional business fax lines 
we automatically charge these fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards  or electronic check payments ecp  monthly in advance 
we also automatically charge the per minute fees not included in our monthly subscription fees to our customers credit cards  debit cards or ecp monthly in arrears unless they exceed a certain dollar threshold  in which case they are charged immediately 
by collecting monthly subscription fees in advance and certain other charges immediately after they are incurred  we are able to reduce the amount of accounts receivable that we have outstanding  thus allowing us to have lower working capital requirements 
collecting in this manner also helps us mitigate bad debt losses  which are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
if a customer s credit card  debit card or ecp is declined  we generally suspend international calling capabilities as well as the customer s ability to incur domestic usage charges in excess of their plan minutes 
historically  in most cases  we are able to correct the problem with the customer within the current monthly billing cycle 
if the customer s credit card  debit card or ecp could not be successfully processed during three billing cycles ie  the current and two subsequent monthly billing cycles  we terminate the account 
from time to time we have generated revenue by charging a fee for activating service  although we do not currently or expect to charge an activation fee to customers 
in these instances when no activation fee is being collected  no customer acquisition costs are deferred 
customer activation fees when collected  along with the related incremental direct customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel  up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer relationship period customer life 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction of telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
this customer life is solely used to amortize deferred activation fees collected  which we have waived for almost all new customers since may  including those signing up for our vonage world plan  along with the related incremental customer acquisition costs 
customers signing up for our vonage world plan currently churn at lower rates than other customers  and therefore appear to have a longer customer life 
because these customers have not paid an activation fee  this does not impact the customer life used in determining the amortization period 
the customer life was months for and will remain at months for based on consistent historical trends 
in the united states  we charge regulatory  compliance  e  and intellectual property related recovery fees on a monthly basis to defray costs and to cover taxes that we are charged by the suppliers of telecommunications services 
in addition  we recognize revenue on a gross basis for contributions to the federal universal service fund usf and related fees 
all other taxes are recorded on a net basis 
in addition  historically  we charged a disconnect fee for customers who terminated their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
disconnect fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
beginning in september  we eliminated the disconnect fee for new customers 
in february of we re introduced service agreements as an option for new customers 
telephony services revenue is offset by the cost of certain customer acquisition activities  such as rebates and promotions 
customer equipment and shipping revenue 
customer equipment and shipping revenue consists of revenue from sales of customer equipment to our wholesalers or directly to customers and retailers 
in addition  customer equipment and shipping revenue includes the fees  when collected  that we charge our customers for shipping any equipment to them 
in addition  historically  we charged an equipment recovery fee for customers who terminated their service plan within the first twelve months of service 
equipment recovery fees are recorded as revenue and are recognized at the time the customer terminates service 
beginning in september  we eliminated the equipment recovery fee for new customers 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of direct cost of telephony services  direct cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expense  marketing expense  and depreciation and amortization 
direct cost of telephony services 
total direct cost of telephony services primarily consists of fees that we pay to third parties on an ongoing basis in order to provide our services 
these fees include access charges that we pay to other telephone companies to terminate domestic and international calls on the public switched telephone network 
these costs represented approximately and of our total direct cost of telephony services for and  respectively  with a portion of these payments ultimately being made to incumbent telephone companies 
when a vonage subscriber calls another vonage subscriber  we do not pay an access charge 
the cost of leasing internet transit services from multiple internet service providers 
this internet connectivity is used to carry voip session initiation signaling and packetized audio media between our subscribers and our regional data centers 
the cost of leasing from other telephone companies the telephone numbers that we provide to our customers 
we lease these telephone numbers on a monthly basis 
the cost of co locating our regional data connection point equipment in third party facilities owned by other telephone companies  internet service providers or collocation facility providers 
the cost of providing local number portability  which allows customers to move their existing telephone numbers from another provider to our service 
only regulated telecommunications providers have access to the centralized number databases that facilitate this process 
because we are not a regulated telecommunications provider  we must pay other telecommunications providers to process our local number portability requests 
the cost of complying with the fcc regulations regarding voip emergency services  which require us to provide enhanced emergency dialing capabilities to transmit calls for all of our customers 
taxes that we pay on our purchase of telecommunications services from our suppliers or imposed by government agencies such as federal usf and related fees 
royalties for use of third party intellectual property 
direct cost of goods sold

our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards nols 
we periodically review this conclusion  which requires significant management judgment

in the fourth quarter of  based upon our sustained profitable operating performance over the past three years excluding certain losses associated with our prior convertible notes and our december debt refinancing and our positive outlook for taxable income in the future  our evaluation determined that the benefit resulting from our net deferred tax assets namely  the nols are likely to be usable prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we released the related valuation allowance against our united states and canada net deferred tax assets  and a portion of the allowance against our state net deferred tax assets as certain nols may expire prior to utilization due to shorter utilization periods in certain states  resulting in a one time non cash income tax benefit of  that we recorded in our statement of operations and a corresponding net deferred tax asset of  that we recorded on our balance sheet on december  in subsequent periods  we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate  an expense that has not been recognized prior to the reduction of the valuation allowance and that will reduce our net income and earnings per share 
in the future  if available evidence changes our conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  we will make an adjustment to the related valuation allowance at that time

telephony services revenue 
telephony services revenue generally has been flat on a quarterly basis with the exception of the first and second quarters of the increases in telephony services revenue in the first and second quarters of were related to fewer service credits due to programs implemented in  higher activation fees and termination fees  and slightly higher usf fees

usf fees fluctuated from quarter to quarter  and were lower in the third and fourth quarters of direct cost of goods sold 
the change in direct cost of goods sold expenses was due to fluctuations in subscriber line additions 
the decrease in quarterly direct cost of goods sold from to was primarily due to the decrease in customer equipment costs resulting from a lower cost device introduced in september  lower promotional activity  and the decrease in amortization costs on deferred customer equipment as the historical deferred customer equipment costs are amortized and new customer equipment costs are no longer charged and deferred 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased quarterly in as a result of our cost management initiatives and have been stable in the selling  general and administrative expenses declined primarily due to a decrease in professional fees  and a decrease in outsourced customer care costs

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including the following those related to the average period of service to a customer the customer life used to amortize deferred revenue and deferred customer acquisition costs associated with customer activation  the useful lives of property and equipment  software costs  and intangible assets  assumptions used for the purpose of determining share based compensation and the fair value of our prior stock warrant using the black scholes option pricing model model  and various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  the key inputs for this model are our stock price at valuation date  exercise price  the dividend yield  risk free interest rate  life in years  and historical volatility of our common stock  assumptions used in determining the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets  assumptions used to determine the fair value of the embedded conversion option within our prior third lien convertible notes using vonage annual report

we base our estimates on historical experience  available market information  appropriate valuation methodologies  and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
revenue recognition the point in time at which revenues are recognized is determined in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition 
at the time a customer signs up for our telephony services  there are the following deliverables providing equipment  if any  to the customer that enables our telephony services and providing telephony services 
the equipment is provided free of charge to our customers and in most instances there are no fees collected at sign up 
we record the fees collected for shipping the equipment to the customer  if any  as shipping and handling revenue at the time of shipment 
a further description of our revenues is as follows substantially all of our operating revenues are telephony services revenues  which are derived primarily from monthly subscription fees that customers are charged under our service plans 
we also derive telephony services revenues from per minute fees for international calls if not covered under a plan  including applications for mobile devices and other stand alone products  and for any calling minutes in excess of a customer s monthly plan limits 
monthly subscription fees are automatically charged to customers credit cards  debit cards or electronic check payments  or ecp  in advance and are recognized over the following month when services are provided 
revenues generated from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans are recognized as services are provided  that is  as minutes are used  and are billed to a customer s credit cards  debit cards or ecp in arrears 
as a result of our multiple billing cycles each month  we estimate the amount of revenues earned from international calls and from customers exceeding allocated call minutes under limited minute plans but not billed from the end of each billing cycle to the end of each reporting period 
these estimates are based primarily upon historical minutes and have been consistent with our actual results 
from time to time we have generated revenue by charging a fee for activating service  although we do not currently or expect to charge an activation fee to customers 
in these instances when no activation fee is being collected  no customer acquisition costs are deferred 
customer activation fees when collected  along with the related incremental direct customer acquisition amounts for customer equipment in the direct channel and for rebates and retailer commissions in the retail channel  up to but not exceeding the activation fee  are deferred and amortized over the estimated average customer life 
the amortization of deferred customer equipment is recorded to direct cost of goods sold 
the amortization of deferred rebates is recorded as a reduction of telephony services revenues 
the amortization of deferred retailer commissions is recorded as marketing expense 
we estimate customer life by analyzing historical trends and applying those trends to future periods 
this customer life is solely used to amortize deferred activation fees collected  along with the related incremental customer acquisition costs 
the average customer life was months in and months for and  respectively  based on consistent historical trends 
the impact of these changes to the average customer life was not material to the consolidated results of operations 
we also provide rebates to customers who purchase their customer equipment from retailers and satisfy minimum service period requirements 
these rebates in excess of activation fees are recorded as a reduction of revenues over the service period based upon the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the rebates 
customer equipment and shipping revenues include sales to our retailers  who subsequently resell this customer equipment to customers 
revenues were reduced for payments to retailers and rebates to customers  who purchased their customer equipment through these retailers  to the extent of customer equipment and shipping revenues 
inventory inventory consists of the cost of customer equipment and is stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the average cost method 
we provide an inventory allowance for customer equipment that has been returned by customers but may not be able to be reissued to new customers or returned to the manufacturer for credit 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted income tax rates for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment 
our net deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss carry forwards nols 
we are required to record a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets if we conclude that it is more likely than not that taxable income generated in the future will be insufficient to utilize the future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets namely  the nols prior to expiration 
we periodically review this conclusion  which requires significant management judgment 
if we are able to conclude in a future period that a future income tax benefit from our net deferred tax assets has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized  we are required in that period to reduce the related valuation allowance with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense 
this will result in a non cash benefit to our net income in the period of the determination 
in subsequent periods  we would expect to recognize income tax expense equal to our pre tax income multiplied by our effective income tax rate  an expense that is not currently recognized each quarter as a result of the valuation allowance 
in the future  if available evidence changes our conclusion that it is more likely than not that we will utilize our net deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  we will make an adjustment to the related valuation allowance at that time 
in the fourth quarter of  we released  of valuation allowance see note income taxes
