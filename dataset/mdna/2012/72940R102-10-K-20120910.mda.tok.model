financial income  net financial income decreased from  for the year ended june  to income of  for the year ended june  the decrease is mainly due to a decrease in revenues from hedging instruments and changes in exchange rates over the past fiscal year offset by an increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances during fiscal year financial income increased from an expense of  for the year ended june  to income of  for the year ended june  the increase in the financial income is due to interest income on bank deposits which increased as our cash balance materially increased during the year ended june  net loss net loss for the year ended june  was  as compared to net loss of  for the year ended june  net loss per share for the year ended june  was  as compared to for the year ended june  the net loss per share decreased as a result of the increase in our weighted average number of shares primarily due to the issuance of additional shares pursuant to equity issuances during the year ended june  that were fully reflected in the fiscal weighted average as discussed further below

liquidity and capital resources as of june   our total current assets were  and our total current liabilities were  on june   we had a working capital surplus of  and an accumulated deficit of as of june   total current assets were  and total current liabilities were  we finance our operations and plan to continue doing so with issuances of securities  grants from the ocs and other parties and also from licensing our technology 
on june   we had a working capital surplus of  and an accumulated deficit of  our cash and cash equivalents as of june  amounted to  this is a decrease of  from the  reported as of june  cash balances decreased in the year ended june  for the reasons presented below operating activities used cash of  in the year ended june  cash used by operating activities in the year ended june  primarily consisted payments of salaries to our employees  and payments of fees to our consultants  subcontractors and professional services providers including costs of the clinical studies  less research and development grants by the ocs and other parties  and less revenues of million from united 
investing activities used cash of  in the year ended june  the investing activities consisted primarily of investment in short term deposits  purchase of available for sale marketable securities and investments in equipment for our research and development facilities and construction of the new facilities 
financing activities generated cash in the amount of  during the year ended june  such amount is due to the exercise of warrants and options  as follows 
during fiscal year  a total of  warrants were exercised via a cashless manner  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock to our investors 
in addition  warrants were exercised for cash and resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock by our investors 
the aggregate cash consideration received for exercise of warrants was  the balance of such amount  ie   was received from the exercise of options for cash 
our cash and cash equivalents as of june  amounted to  this is an increase of  from the  reported as of june  cash balances increased in the year ended june  for the reasons presented below operating activities used cash of  in the year ended june  cash used by operating activities in the year ended june  primarily consisted of payments of salaries to our employees  and payments of fees to our consultants  subcontractors and professional services providers including costs of the clinical studies  less research and development grants by the ocs and other parties 
investing activities used cash of  in the year ended june  the investing activities consisted primarily of repayments of short term deposits  offset by investments in equipment for our r d facilities and construction of a new research lab 
financing activities generated cash in the amount of  during the year ended june  substantially all of such amount is attributable to offerings we closed in october and february and exercise of warrants  as follows 
on october   we closed an offering pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at an exercise price per share of 
no separate consideration was paid for the warrants 
the warrants have a term of four years and are exercisable starting six months following the issuance thereof 
the aggregate net proceeds from the sale of the shares and the warrants were approximately  on february   we closed a firm commitment underwritten public offering of  units  with each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants sold in the offering are exercisable for a period of five years commencing six months following issuance  at an exercise price of per share 
also  on february  we closed the exercise by the underwriters of their full overallotment option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the aggregate net proceeds to us were approximately million 
during january june  a total of  warrants were exercised via a cashless manner  resulting in the issuance of  shares of common stock to our investors 
in addition  warrants were exercised for cash and resulted in the issuance of  shares of common stock by our investors 
the aggregate cash consideration received was  during the years that ended june   and we received approximately   and  respectively  from the ocs towards our research and development expenses 
such grants are subject to payment of royalties to the ocs  which are limited to repayment the grant amount received plus interest 
in addition  the ocs limits our ability to transfer know how developed with ocs support outside of israel  regardless of whether the royalties were fully paid 
in addition  during fiscal year we received a grant from the us government  in the amount of  we adhere to an investment policy set by our investment committee which aims to preserve our financial assets  maintain adequate liquidity and maximize return 
such policy further provides that we should hold the vast majority of our current assets in bank deposits and the remainder of our current assets is to be invested in government bonds and a combination of corporate bonds and relatively low risk stocks 
as of today  the currency of our financial portfolio is mainly in us dollars and we use forward and options contracts in order to hedge our exposures to currencies other than the us dollar 
outlook we do not expect to generate any revenues from sales of products in the next twelve months 
our products will likely not be ready for sale for at least three years  if at all 
we expect to generate revenues  which in the short and medium terms will unlikely exceed our costs of operations  from the sale of licenses to use our technology or products  as we have in the united agreement 
our management believes that we may need to raise additional funds before we have cash flow from operations that can materially decrease our dependence on our existing cash and other liquidity resources 
we are continually looking for sources of funding  including non diluting sources such as the ocs grants 
we have an effective shelf registration statement  which we may use in the future to raise additional funds 
we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase significantly during fiscal year this is mainly attributable to the anticipated phase ii and phase ii iii clinical trials  continuing the construction of our clinical manufacturing facility and developing capabilities for new clinical indications of plx cells 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue in fiscal year at similar levels as they were in fiscal year the ocs has supported our activity in the past six years 
our last program  for the seventh year  was approved by the ocs in april and is for the period march until december in addition the european authorities approved a research grant under the european commission s seventh framework program fp in the amount of approximately  for a period of years which began on january  we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations for at least the next months 
application of critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form k 
we believe that the accounting policies below are critical for one to fully understand and evaluate our financial condition and results of operations 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which we prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate such estimates and judgments  including those described in greater detail below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition from the license agreement with united therapeutics we recognize revenue pursuant to the united agreement in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements 
revenues from the non refundable upfront license fee of  are recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated development period  resulting in revenues of  for the year ended june   in accordance with sab the development period for the united project is estimated using the current project progress and future expected timeline of clinical trials in pah 
we also received a refundable  advance payment on the development  of  that is deductible against development expenses as it accrued in accordance with asc during the year ended june   we deducted an amount of approximately  stock based compensation stock based compensation is considered critical accounting policy due to the significant expenses of restricted stock units which were granted to our employees  directors and consultants 
in fiscal year we recorded stock based compensation expenses related to restricted stock units in the amount of  in accordance with asc  restricted shares units to employees and directors are measured at their fair value on the grant date 
all restricted shares units granted in and were granted for no consideration  therefore their fair value was equal to the share price at the date of grant  based on the close trading price of our shares known at the grant date 
the restricted shares units to non employees consultants are remeasured in any future vesting period for the unvested portion of the grants 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
we have graded vesting based on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of each of the awards 
the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate affects the number of the shares 
based on our historical experience  the pre vesting forfeiture rate per grant is for the shares granted to employees and for the shares granted to our directors  officers and non employees consultants 
marketable securities marketable securities consist of corporate bonds  government bonds and stocks 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation at each balance sheet date 
in accordance with fasb asc no 
 investment debt and equity securities  we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are stated at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on sales of marketable securities  as determined on a specific identification basis  are included in financial income 
the amortized cost of marketable securities is adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount to maturity  both of which  together with interest  are included in financial income 
marketable securities are classified within level or level because marketable securities are valued using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs 
we recognize an impairment charge when a decline in the fair value of our investments is below the cost basis and is judged to be other than temporary 
factors considered in making such a determination include the duration and severity of the impairment  the reason for the decline in value  the potential recovery period and our intent to sell  including whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of cost basis 
as such  we did not recognize any impairment charges on outstanding securities during the year ended june  research and development expenses  net we expect our research and development expense to remain our primary expense in the near future as we continue to develop our product candidates 
research and development expense consists of internal costs associated with research and development activities  payments made to consultants and subcontractors such as research organizations  manufacturing development costs  personnel related expenses  including salaries  benefits  travel  and related costs for the personnel involved in research and development  activities relating to the preclinical studies and clinical trials  and facilities and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  as well as laboratory and other supplies 
research and development expenses  net of participations are charged to the statement of operations as incurred 
r d grants from the government of israel and other parties for funding approved research and development projects are recognized at the time we are entitled to such grants  on the basis of the cost incurred and applied as a deduction from research and development costs 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive grants from the ocs in amounts sufficient for our operations  if at all 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commitments at june   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations contractor obligations minimum purchase requirements pre clinical research study obligations clinical research study obligations total estimated cancellation fees 
off balance sheet arrangements our company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and inflation 
as of june   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term bank deposits and million in marketable securities 
our investment policy  set by our investment committee  aims to preserve our financial assets  maintain adequate liquidity and maximize return 
such policy further provides that we should hold the vast majority of our current assets in bank deposits and the remainder of our current assets is to be invested in government bonds and a combination of corporate bonds and relatively low risk stocks 
as of today  the currency of our financial portfolio is mainly in us dollars and we use forward and options contracts in order to hedge our exposures to currencies other than the us dollar 
interest rate risk we mostly invest our cash surplus in bank deposits in banks in israel 
since the bank deposits typically carry fixed interest rates  financial income over the holding period is not sensitive to changes in interest rates 
however  our interest gains from future deposits may decline in the future as a result of changes in the financial markets 
in addition  our income from marketable securities is exposed to market risks resulting from changes in interest rates 
in any event  given the historic low levels of the interest rate  we estimate that a further decline in the interest rate we are receiving will not result in a material adverse effect to our business 
foreign currency exchange risk and inflation a significant portion of our expenditures  including salaries  lab materials  consultants fees and office expenses relate to our operations in israel 
the cost of those israeli operations  as expressed in us dollars  is influenced by the extent to which any increase in the rate of inflation in israel is not offset or is offset on a lagging basis by a devaluation of the nis in relation to the us dollar 
if the us dollar declines in value in relation to the nis  it will become more expensive for us to fund our operations in israel 
in addition  as of june   we own net balances in nis of approximately million 
assuming a appreciation of the nis against the us dollar  we would experience exchange rate gain of approximately  while assuming a devaluation of the nis against the us dollars  we would experience an exchange rate loss of approximately  in both cases excluding the effect of our hedging transactions as described below 
the exchange rate of the us dollar to the nis  based on exchange rates published by the bank of israel  was as follows year ended june  average rate for period rate at period end we use currency hedging transactions of options and forwards to decrease the risk of financial exposure from fluctuations in the exchange rate of the us dollar against the nis
