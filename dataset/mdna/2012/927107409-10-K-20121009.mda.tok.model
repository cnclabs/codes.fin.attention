during fiscal  sales per store were  and sales per square foot of selling space were  management believes these figures are among the highest in the supermarket industry 
the supermarket industry is highly competitive 
the company competes directly with multiple retail formats  including national  regional and local supermarket chains as well as warehouse clubs  supercenters  drug stores  discount general merchandise stores  fast food chains  restaurants  dollar stores and convenience stores 
village competes by using low pricing  superior customer service  and a broad range of consistently available quality products  including shoprite private labeled products 
the shoprite price plus card also strengthens customer loyalty 
we consider a variety of indicators to evaluate our performance  such as same store sales  percentage of total sales by department mix  shrink  departmental gross profit percentage  sales per labor hour  and hourly labor rates 
during fiscal and  the supermarket industry was impacted by changing consumer behavior due to the weak economy and high unemployment 
consumers are increasingly cooking meals at home  but spending cautiously by trading down to lower priced items  including private label  and concentrating their buying on sale items

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
impairment the company reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets  such as property  equipment and fixtures for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
such review analyzes the undiscounted estimated future cash flows from asset groups at the store level to determine if the carrying value of such assets are recoverable from their respective cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  it is measured by comparing the fair value of the long lived asset groups held for use to their carrying value 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the end of each fiscal year  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
since the company s stock is not widely traded  management utilizes valuation techniques  such as earnings multiples  in addition to the company s market capitalization to assess goodwill for impairment 
calculating the fair value of a reporting unit requires the use of estimates 
management believes the fair value of village s one reporting unit exceeds its carrying value at july  should the company s carrying value of its one reporting unit exceed its fair value  the amount of any resulting goodwill impairment may be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
patronage dividends as a stockholder of wakefern  village earns a share of wakefern s earnings  which are distributed as a patronage dividend see note 
this dividend is based on a distribution of substantially all of wakefern s operating profits for its fiscal year which ends september in proportion to the dollar volume of purchases by each member from wakefern during that fiscal year 
patronage dividends are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales as merchandise is sold 
village accrues estimated patronage dividends due from wakefern quarterly based on an estimate of the annual wakefern patronage dividend and an estimate of village s share of this annual dividend based on village s estimated proportional share of the dollar volume of business transacted with wakefern that year 
the amount of patronage dividends receivable based on these estimates were  and  at july  and july   respectively 
pension plans the determination of the company s obligation and expense for company sponsored pension plans is dependent  in part  on village s selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
these assumptions are described in note and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation costs 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
while management believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect cash flows  pension obligations and future expense 
the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the company s pension obligations could be effectively settled based on the expected timing and amounts of benefits payable to participants under the plans 
our methodology for selecting the discount rate as of july  was to match the plans cash flows to that of a yield curve on high quality fixed income investments 
based on this method  we utilized a weighted average discount rate of at july  compared to at july  the decrease in the discount rate  and a change in the mortality table utilized  increased the projected benefit obligation at july  by approximately  village evaluated the expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and the expected increase in compensation costs of to and concluded no changes in these assumptions were necessary in estimating pension plan obligations and expense 
sensitivity to changes in the major assumptions used in the calculation of the company s pension plans is as follows percentage point change projected benfit obligation decrease increase expense decrease increase discount rate expected return on assets village contributed  and  in fiscal and  respectively  to these company sponsored pension plans 
village expects to contribute  in fiscal to these plans 
the  and expected contributions are substantially all voluntary contributions 
the company also contributes to several multi employer pension plans based on obligations arising from collective bargaining agreements 
these plans provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
we recognize expense in connection with these plans as contributions are funded 
on april   village  along with all of the other individual employers trading as shoprite  permanently withdrew from participating in the united food and commercial workers local retail meat pension fund the fund  effective the end of april the fund is a multi employer defined benefit plan that includes other supermarket operators 
village  along with the other affiliated shoprite operators  determined to withdraw from the fund due to exposures to market risks associated with all defined benefit plans and the inability to partition shoprite s liabilities from those of the other participating supermarket operators 
village now provides affected associates with a defined contribution plan for future service  which eliminates market risks and the exposure to shared liabilities of other operators  and is estimated to be less costly than the defined benefit plan in the future  while ensuring that our associates are provided a secure benefit 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of  in fiscal for this withdrawal liability  which represented our estimate of the liability based on calculations provided by the fund actuary 
the company settled this obligation in january  resulting in a pre tax benefit of in fiscal village remains liable for potential additional withdrawal liabilities to the fund in the event a mass withdrawal  as defined by statute  occurs within two plan years after the plan year of village s withdrawal 
such liabilities could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation all share based payments to employees are recognized in the financial statements as compensation expense based on the fair market value on the date of grant 
village determines the fair market value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions  such as a risk free interest rate  expected volatility  expected dividend yield and expected life of options  in order to arrive at a fair value estimate 
uncertain tax positions the company is subject to periodic audits by various taxing authorities 
these audits may challenge certain of the company s tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions 
accounting for these uncertain tax positions requires significant management judgment 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future years 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal compared to  in the corresponding period of the prior year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to settlement of a  pension withdrawal liability in fiscal  a decrease in payables in the current fiscal year as compared to an increase in the prior fiscal year  and the prior year including a refund of cash the company had placed in escrow to fund a property acquisition 
these decreases were partially offset by higher net income in the current fiscal year 
during fiscal  village used cash to fund capital expenditures of  the acquisition of the old bridge shoprite of  and dividends of  capital expenditures include remodeling and equipment for the acquired maryland stores  the installation of solar panels in one store and several small remodels 
net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in payables in the current fiscal year compared to a decrease in payables in the prior fiscal year

the company s primary sources of liquidity in fiscal are expected to be cash and cash equivalents on hand at july  and operating cash flow generated in fiscal at july   the company had a  month note receivable due from wakefern earning a fixed rate of 
this note is automatically extended for additional  recurring day periods  unless  not later than one year prior to the due date  the company notifies wakefern requesting payment on the due date 
this note currently is scheduled to mature on august  village has an unsecured revolving credit agreement providing a maximum amount available for borrowing of  this loan agreement expires on december  the revolving credit line can be used for general corporate purposes 
indebtedness under this agreement bears interest at the prime rate  or at the eurodollar rate  at the company s option  plus applicable margins based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
there were no amounts outstanding at july  or july  under this facility 
the revolving loan agreement contains covenants that  among other conditions  require a maximum liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a positive net income

the above amounts for capital  financing and operating leases include interest  but do not include certain obligations under these leases for other charges 
these charges consisted of the following in fiscal real estate taxes  common area maintenance  insurance  and contingent rentals pension plan funding requirements are excluded from the above table as estimated contribution amounts for future years are uncertain 
required future contributions will be determined by  among other factors  actual investment performance of plan assets  interest rates required to be used to calculate pension obligations  and changes in legislation 
the company expects to contribute  in fiscal to fund company sponsored defined benefit pension plans compared to actual contributions of  in fiscal the table also excludes contributions under various multi employer pension plans  which totaled  in fiscal as more fully described previously herein  during village permanently withdrew from participating in one multi employer defined benefit plan 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of  in fiscal for this withdrawal liability 
the company settled this obligation in january  resulting in a pre tax benefit of in fiscal the amount of unrecognized tax benefits of  at july  has been excluded from this table because a reasonable estimate of the timing of future tax settlements cannot be determined 
outlook this annual report contains certain forward looking statements about village s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of information currently available 
such statements relate to  for example economic conditions  expected pension plan contributions  projected capital expenditures  cash flow requirements  inflation expectations  and legal matters  and are indicated by words such as will  expect  should  intend  anticipates  believes and similar words or phrases 
the company cautions the reader that there is no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from the results expressed  suggested or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect developments or information obtained after the date hereof 
we expect same store sales to increase from to in fiscal  including the positive impact from the inclusion of the maryland stores in same stores sales 
during fiscal and  the supermarket industry was impacted by changing consumer behavior due to the weak economy and high unemployment 
consumers are increasingly cooking meals at home  but spending cautiously by trading down to lower priced items  including private label  and concentrating their buying on sale items 
management expects these trends to continue in fiscal we expect modest retail price inflation in fiscal we have budgeted  for capital expenditures in fiscal this amount includes the beginning of construction of two replacement stores and three major remodels 
on december   the company paid special dividends of  the board of directors declared these dividends to provide a return to shareholders in  instead of  while tax rates on dividends remained low 
this action was taken before the tax rate was extended in december the company is currently paying dividends at an annualized rate of per class a share and per class b share 
the board will reconsider our dividend policy and other methods of providing returns to shareholders in the future based on a variety of factors  including tax rates on dividends and capital gains in effect 
we believe cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures and debt payments for the foreseeable future 
we expect our effective income tax rate in fiscal to be we expect operating expenses will be affected by increased costs in certain areas  such as medical and pension costs 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ from the forward looking statements contained in this report 
these include the supermarket business is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins 
results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by competitive pricing and promotional programs  industry consolidation and competitor store openings 
village competes with national and regional supermarkets  local supermarkets  warehouse club stores  supercenters  drug stores  convenience stores  dollar stores  discount merchandisers  restaurants and other local retailers 
some of these competitors have greater financial resources  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do 
the company s stores are concentrated in new jersey  with one store in northeastern pennsylvania and two in maryland 
we are vulnerable to economic downturns in new jersey in addition to those that may affect the country as a whole 
economic conditions such as inflation  deflation  interest rates  energy costs and unemployment rates may adversely affect our sales and profits 
village acquired two stores in july in maryland  a new market for village where the shoprite name is less known than in new jersey 
as the company begins operating in this new market  marketing and other costs will be higher than in established markets as village attempts to build market share and brand awareness 
in addition  sales for these two stores are initially expected to be lower than the typical company store 
potentially higher costs and sales results lower than the company s expectations could have a material adverse effect on village s results of operations 
the company is currently planning the construction of two replacement stores 
if we are unable to open these replacement stores before existing store lease expirations and we are unable to execute lease extensions  we may be adversely impacted by any potential time period between the closure of our existing stores and the opening of the replacement stores 
if we execute lease extensions on the existing stores planned to be replaced  terms may be unfavorable and we may incur charges for rental obligations for periods after store closure 
village purchases substantially all of its merchandise from wakefern 
in addition  wakefern provides the company with support services in numerous areas including supplies  advertising  liability and property insurance  technology support and other store services 
further  village receives patronage dividends and other product incentives from wakefern 
any material change in wakefern s method of operation or a termination or material modification of village s relationship with wakefern could have an adverse impact on the conduct of the company s business and could involve additional expense for village 
the failure of any wakefern member to fulfill its obligations to wakefern or a member s insolvency or withdrawal from wakefern could result in increased costs to the company 
additionally  an adverse change in wakefern s results of operations could have an adverse effect on village s results of operations 
approximately of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
any work stoppages could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
if we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided for in the collective bargaining agreements  we may experience increased operating costs 
village could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of the food supply chain 
the real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in a loss of consumer confidence and product liability claims  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations 
on april   village  along with all of the other individual employers trading as shoprite  permanently withdrew from participating in the united food and commercial workers local retail meat pension fund the fund  effective the end of april the fund is a multi employer defined benefit plan that includes other supermarket operators 
village  along with the other affiliated shoprite operators  determined to withdraw from the fund due to exposures to market risks associated with all defined benefit plans and the inability to partition shoprite s liabilities from those of the other participating supermarket operators 
village now provides affected associates with a defined contribution plan for future service  which eliminates market risks and the exposure to shared liabilities of other operators  and is estimated to be less costly than the defined benefit plan in the future  while ensuring that our associates are provided a secure benefit 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of  in fiscal for this withdrawal liability  which represented our estimate of the liability based on calculations provided by the fund actuary 
the company settled this obligation in january  resulting in a pre tax benefit of in fiscal village remains liable for potential additional withdrawal liabilities to the fund in the event a mass withdrawal  as defined by statute  occurs within two plan years after the plan year of village s withdrawal 
such liabilities could be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
certain of the multi employer plans to which we contribute are underfunded 
as a result  we expect that contributions to these plans may increase 
additionally  the benefit levels and related items will be issues in the negotiation of our collective bargaining agreements 
under current law  an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multi employer pension plan may incur a withdrawal liability to the plan  which represents the portion of the plan s underfunding that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules 
the failure of a withdrawing employer to fund these obligations can impact remaining employers 
the amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multi employer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining  actions taken by trustees who manage the plans  government regulations and the actual return on assets held in the plans  among other factors 
our effective tax rate may be impacted by the results of tax examinations and changes in tax laws  including the disputes with the state of new jersey described in note of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements
