our effective tax rate for fiscal reflects a net discrete tax benefit of approximately million 
in addition  our fiscal effective tax rate reflects the fact that a portion of our million expense for the impairment of our mobile data communications segment s goodwill was non deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding all of the aforementioned items in both periods  our effective tax rate for fiscal was approximately as compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to the retroactive extension of the federal research and experimentation credit whose related legislation was extended in december  and the increased benefit of our domestic production activities deduction resulting from the scheduled phase in of the related legislation

the decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal was driven by the following net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating income due in part to a million net merger termination fee we received during fiscal  offset  in part  by a decrease in net working capital requirements during fiscal although we expect to generate net cash from operating activities for fiscal  we are unable to accurately predict the amount  which will be impacted by the timing of working capital requirements associated with our overall sales efforts  including our efforts relating to our million over the horizon microwave system contract 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we spent million to purchase property  plant and equipment  including expenditures relating to ongoing equipment upgrades and enhancements to our high volume technology manufacturing center in tempe  arizona 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  we used million for the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our current million stock repurchase program 
in addition  during fiscal  we paid million in cash dividends to our stockholders 

index our investment policy relating to our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents is intended to minimize principal loss while at the same time maximize the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we generally invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market mutual funds both government and commercial  certificates of deposit  bank deposits  and us treasury securities 
many of our money market mutual funds invest in direct obligations of the us government  bank securities guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation  certificates of deposit and commercial paper and other securities issued by other companies 
while we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity or the ultimate outcome of the current european monetary issues and related concerns  we believe our investment policies are appropriate in the current environment 
ultimately  the availability of our cash and cash equivalents is dependent on a well functioning liquid market 
at july   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
as of july   our material short term cash requirements primarily consist of cash necessary to fund i our ongoing working capital needs  including income tax payments  ii anticipated quarterly dividends  iii repurchases of our common stock that we may make pursuant to our stock repurchase program  and iv contingent earn out payments we expect to make through october related to our acquisition of stampede 
in addition  in future periods  we may also redeploy a large portion of our cash and cash equivalents for one or more acquisitions 
we are currently authorized by our board of directors to repurchase our stock pursuant to a million stock repurchase program 
pursuant to this authorization  during fiscal  we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock in open market transactions with an average price per share of and at an aggregate cost of million including transaction costs and in fiscal  we purchased approximately million shares with an average price per share of  at an aggregate cost of million including transaction costs 
as of july   million remains available for purchases from the million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors 
pursuant to a million stock repurchase program established in september  during fiscal we purchased approximately million shares with an average price per share of and at an aggregate cost of million including transaction costs 
this program was completed in july in september  our board of directors raised our annual targeted dividend from per common share to per common share 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share on september   totaling million  on december   totaling million  on march   totaling million  and june   totaling million  which were paid on november   february   may  and august   respectively 
on september   our board of directors declared our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend of per common share payable on november  to shareholders of record at the close of business on october  future dividends are subject to board approval 
our material long term cash requirements primarily consist of the possible use of cash to repay million of our convertible senior notes and payments relating to our operating leases 
in addition  we expect to make future cash payments of approximately million related to our radyne related restructuring plan 
we have historically met both our short term and long term cash requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operating activities and cash generated from financing transactions 
in june  we amended our secured revolving credit facility 
the amended agreement allows us to borrow up to million  has lower fees  provides an option to extend the agreement beyond april  and continues to provide us the flexibility to repurchase additional shares of our common stock 
in light of ongoing tight credit market conditions and overall adverse business conditions  we continue to receive requests from our customers for higher credit limits and longer payment terms 
because of our strong cash position and the nominal amount of interest we are earning on our cash and cash equivalents  we have  on a limited basis  approved certain customer requests 
we continue to monitor our accounts receivable credit portfolio and have not had any material negative customer credit experiences to date 
based on our anticipated level of future sales and operating income  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet both our currently anticipated short term and long term operating cash requirements 
although it is difficult in the current economic and credit environment to predict the terms and conditions of financing that may be available in the future  should our short term or long term cash requirements increase beyond our current expectations  we believe that we would have sufficient access to credit from financial institutions and or financing from public and private debt and equity markets
