item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are an innovator in the field of metrology and inspection systems for semiconductor manufacturing and other industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and to identify defects that can affect production yields and performance 
principal factors that impact our revenue growth include capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors to increase capacity and to enable their development of new technologies  and our ability to take market share 
the increasing complexity of the manufacturing processes for semiconductors is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems  as are the adoption of optical critical dimension ocd metrology across fabrication processes  adoption of immersion lithography and double patterning  adoption of new types of thin film materials  the adoption of advanced packaging strategies and wafer backside inspection and the need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well as to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are primarily derived from product sales but are also derived from customer service and system upgrades for the installed base of our products 
in  we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
changing trends in the semiconductor industry continue to drive the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include proliferation of optical critical dimension metrology across fabrication processes 
our customers use photolithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
in advanced node device definition  additional monitoring of thickness and profile dimensions on these patterned structures at cmp  etch  and thin film processing is driving broader ocd adoption 
our proprietary ocd systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 
nanometrics ocd technology is broadly adopted across nand  dram  hdd  and logic semiconductor manufacturing processes 
adoption of advanced packaging processes our customers use photolithographic  etching  metallization and wafer thinning to enable next generation advanced packaging solutions for semiconductor devices 
the new packaging leads to increased functionality in smaller  less expensive form factors 
advanced packages can be broken down into high density flip chip or bump packages that increase pin density allowing for more complex i o on advanced cpu parts 
or  similar or different devices can be stacked at the wafer level using a through silicon via process 
the tsv process enables high density small form factor parts  being primarily driven by mobile consumer products ie cellular 
table of contents telephones with integrated cmos camera sensors 
increasingly advanced packaging technologies are being adopted by our end customers 
adoption of new types of thin film materials 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the traditional aluminum etch back interconnect flows as well as conventional gate dielectric materials  all which drive a broader adoption of thin film and ocd metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers have adopted copper in logic idm and it is now proliferating in next generation dram and flash nodes 
additionally  to achieve improved transistor performance in logic devices and higher cell densities in memory devices  new materials including high dielectric constant or high k gate materials are increasingly being substituted for traditional silicon oxide gate dielectric materials 
high k materials are comprised of complex thin films including layers of hafnium oxide and a bi layer of thin film metals 
our advanced metrology and inspection solutions are required for control of process steps  which are critical to enable the device performance improvements that these new materials allow 
development of d transistor architectures 
our end customers continue to improve device density and performance by scaling front end of line transistor architectures 
many of these designs have buried features and high aspect ratio stacked features that enable improved performance and density 
the advanced designs require additional process control to manage the complex shapes and materials properties  driving additional applications for both ocd and our unifire systems 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and automated systems throughout the fabrication to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
reduced number of customers 
our market is characterized by an ongoing oligopolistic trend which drives customer concentration 
the largest customer accounted for of our total revenue in the fiscal year  and the largest customer accounted for and of our total revenue in the fiscal year and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations  impairment and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from the sale of process control metrology and inspection systems product revenue as well as spare part sales  billable services  service contracts  and upgrades together service revenue 
upgrades are a group of parts and or software that change the existing configuration of a product and are included in service revenue 
they are distinguished from product revenue  which consists of complete  automated process control metrology systems the system s 
nanometrics systems consist of hardware and software components that function together to deliver the essential functionality of the system 
arrangements for sales of systems often include defined customer specified acceptance criteria 
for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which usually occurs upon shipment from the company s manufacturing location  if it can be reliably demonstrated that the product has successfully met the defined customer specified acceptance criteria and all other recognition criteria has been met 
for initial sales where the company has not previously met the defined customer specified acceptance criteria  product revenues are recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
in japan  where contractual terms with the customer specify risk of loss and title transfers upon customer acceptance  revenue is recognized upon receipt of written customer acceptance  provided that all other recognition criteria has been met 
we warrant our products against defects in manufacturing 
upon recognition of product revenue  a liability is recorded for anticipated warranty costs 
on occasion  customers request a warranty period longer than our standard warranty 
in those instances where extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer  the associated revenue is deferred and recognized as service revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
the portion of service contracts and extended warranty 
table of contents services agreements that are uncompleted at the end of any reporting period are included in deferred revenue 
as part of customer services  we also sell software that is considered to be an upgrade to a customer s existing systems 
these standalone software upgrades are not essential to the tangible product s functionality and are accounted for under software revenue recognition rules which require vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value to allocate revenue in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue from upgrades is recognized when the upgrades are delivered to the customer  provided that all other recognition criteria have been met 
revenue related to spare parts is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to billable services is recognized as the services are performed 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer during or after the warranty period and revenue is recognized ratably over the service contract period 
frequently  we deliver products and various services in a single transaction 
our deliverables consist of tools  installation  upgrades  billable services  spare parts  and service contracts 
our typical multi element arrangements include a sale of one or multiple tools that include installation and standard warranty 
other arrangements may consist of a sale of tools bundled with service elements or delivery of different types of services 
tools  upgrades  and spare parts are delivered to customers within a period of up to six months from order date 
installation is usually performed soon after delivery of the tool 
billable services are billed on a time and materials basis and performed as requested by customers 
under service contract arrangements  services are provided as needed over the fixed arrangement term and such terms can be up to months 
we do not generally grant customers a general right of return or refund and impose a penalty on orders canceled prior to the scheduled shipment date 
on january   we adopted the new accounting guidance for arrangements with software elements and or multiple deliverables 
the amended guidance for multiple deliverable arrangements did not change the units of accounting for our revenue transactions  and most products and services qualify as separate units of accounting 
the new guidance established a hierarchy of evidence to determine the standalone selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence tpe  or best estimated selling price besp 
we regularly evaluate our revenue arrangements to identify deliverables and to determine whether these deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting 
in accordance with the new guidance  we allocate the arrangement consideration among the deliverables based on relative best estimated selling price 
we have established vsoe for some of our products and services when a substantial majority of selling prices falls within a narrow range when sold separately 
for deliverables with no established vsoe  we use best estimated selling price to determine standalone selling price for such deliverable 
we do not use tpe to determine standalone selling price since this information is not widely available in the market as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solutions offered differ substantially from our competitors 
we have established a process for developing estimated selling prices  which incorporates historical selling prices  the effect of market conditions  gross margin objectives  pricing practices  as well as entity specific factors 
we monitor and evaluate estimated selling price on a regular basis to ensure that changes in circumstances are accounted for in a timely manner 
the adoption of the new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
when certain elements in multiple element arrangements are not delivered or accepted at the end of a reporting period  the relative selling prices of undelivered elements are deferred until these elements are delivered and or accepted 
if deliverables cannot be accounted for as separate units of accounting  the entire arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting and revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and all revenue recognition requirements are met 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts adequately reflects our risk associated with our receivables 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we would assess the necessity of recording additional allowances 
this would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we are exposed to a number of economic and industry specific factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated 
table of contents usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
once a reserve has been established  it is maintained until the part to which it relates is sold or is otherwise disposed of 
therefore  reserved inventory sale has higher gross profit margin 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
inventory includes evaluation tools placed at customer sites 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the age of the inventory and potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
demonstration inventory is amortized over its useful life and the amortization expense is included in total depreciation and amortization on our cash flow statement 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those that we project  additional reserves may be required 
product warranties we sell the majority of our products with a standard twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of acceptance or shipment date 
we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to the cost of products sold 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage and labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  we may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide us in estimating our warranty accrual 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
business combinations we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets and inventory acquired 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair value of inventory acquired by utilizing the net realizable value method which is based on the estimated sales price of the product less appropriate costs to complete and selling costs 
examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from sales of products  services and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the value of the acquired company s customer relationships  as well as assumptions about the estimated useful lives of the relationships  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of assumptions  estimates or actual results associated with business combinations 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized but tested annually for impairment 
our impairment review process is completed as of november th of each year or whenever events or circumstances occur which indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
during the fourth quarter of  we early adopted the accounting standard update for testing goodwill for impairment 
the accounting standard update provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if  after assessing the qualitative factors  a company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if a company concludes otherwise  then 
table of contents it is required to perform the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
the first step requires a comparison of the fair value of our reporting unit to its net book value 
if the fair value is greater  then no impairment is deemed to have occurred 
if the fair value is less  then the second step must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of actual impairment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of goodwill for the company at the reporting unit level  we make estimates and judgments about future revenues and cash flows for the reporting unit 
to determine the fair value  our review process includes the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and our assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital 
our estimates of market segment growth  our market segment share and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
our business consists of both established and emerging technologies and our forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
we also consider our market capitalization on the dates of our impairment tests in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
as part of this assessment  we consider the trading value of our stock and implied value of as compared to our net assets as well as the valuation of acquired businesses 
as part of the second step in determining the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amount assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
when impairment is deemed to have occurred  we will recognize an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill to its implied fair value 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes such that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a continuous basis throughout the year to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the expected term of options granted is calculated based on the simplified method 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price 
restructuring charges there were no restructuring or related charges during the fiscal years and during the fiscal year  we implemented restructuring programs based on our business strategy and recorded significant accruals in connection with the restructuring program 
in connection with the plan we recorded estimated expenses for severance and other costs 
costs associated with restructuring activities are recognized when they are incurred rather than the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan in accordance with asc a liability for post employment benefits is incurred when payment is probable  the amount is reasonably estimable  and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated 
given the significance and complexity of restructuring activities  and the timing of the execution of such activities  the restructuring process involves periodic reassessments of the estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating market conditions for expected disposals of assets and vacancy of space 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the respective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal years ended december   january  and january  
table of contents fiscal year net revenues products service total net revenues costs of net revenues cost of products cost of service total costs of net revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructuring charge legal settlement asset impairment total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal years  and ended december   january  and january   respectively total net revenues 
our net revenues were comprised of the following product lines in thousands  except percent fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems materials characterization total product revenue service total net revenues 
table of contents fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems materials characterization total product revenue service total net revenues in  revenue from products increased by million from  principally due to increased demand from our customers associated with the expansion of their semiconductor fabrication plants  particularly in the first half of approximately million of the increase was attributable to sales of our automated systems primarily for atlas 
integrated systems accounted for approximately million of the increase principally series and impulse and materials characterization increased by million 
product revenue in the fourth quarter of decreased by million compared to the third quarter of due to a general pause in spending by some of our largest customers 
we do not expect this trend to continue into the first quarter of service revenue increased by million in principally due to increased demand for services provided under customer contracts 
in the revenue from products increased by million over the previous year  most of it attributable to increased capital spending by our customers 
about million of this increase was attributable to automated systems atlas  nanogen  mosaic tm  and lynx tm  materials characterization tools accounted for million of this increase and million represented increased sales of integrated systems 
service revenue increased by million in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  a significant portion of this increase was due to increased parts sales of million 
gross margins 
our gross margin breakdown was as follows fiscal year products service the gross margin on product revenue decreased from in to in the decrease is due to the approximately equivalent effects of higher warranty costs and higher installation costs driven by a change in product mix  and to a lesser extent due to lower factory absorption in the fourth quarter of the gross margin on service revenue improved in from to  principally due to reduction in field service labor costs and refinement of our allocation of warranty and installation costs between product and services 
the gross margin on product revenue increased significantly in compared to by percentage points from to 
improved margins of points were related to higher sales volume levels  which resulted in higher favorable absorption of manufacturing costs and lower warranty expense which was partially offset by increased royalties 
the balance of the product margin improvement of points was related to increased product margins due to a more favorable product mix of higher margin products 
the margins on service revenue decreased from in to in this decrease was attributable to an point decline in margins on upgrades and to cost increases related to hiring employees in the service organization to support the higher volume of sales and related service requirements 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses were comprised of the following categories in thousands 
table of contents fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets legal settlement asset impairment total operating expenses fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charge asset impairment total operating expenses research and development 
research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal year compared to primarily related to development of the atlas ii tm and costs associated with the acquisition of nanda 
this increase consisted of million of labor costs relating to increased hiring  incentive compensation and benefit costs  million of increased engineering materials and tooling  million from increased depreciation  and million from consulting 
research and development costs increased by million or in fiscal year when compared to  this increase was a result of million increase in labor and consulting costs  million increase in cost of facilities  and million for engineering materials 
selling 
selling expenses increased by million or in fiscal year compared to higher costs are a result of labor costs of million related to increased hiring  compensation and benefits including commissions on higher revenues and stock based compensation 
the remainder of the increase represents principally million increase in travel expenses due to the increased number of sales personnel and transactions  million increase in facilities  million increase in marketing activities  million increase in depreciation  and million of other costs 
selling expenses increased by million or in fiscal year  when compared to higher costs are a result of increased labor costs of million including increases in salaries  bonus  commission  severance and stock based compensation and a million increase in travel expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or in fiscal year compared to the higher costs are the result of million related to professional fees associated with the nanda acquisition  million increase in other professional services  million increase in labor costs related to hiring of employees  million increase in facilities  million increase in depreciation  million increase in legal expenses and million aggregate increase in other costs including allowance for doubtful accounts  travel  and consulting services 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or in fiscal year  compared to increases were the result of million in bonuses to executive officers related to the financial performance in  increased salary expense of million attributed to increased headcount  a million increase in stock based compensation and million increase in the cost of facilities 

table of contents amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangibles assets in fiscal year increased by million  compared to  primarily as a result of the amortization of intangible assets acquired from nanda  partially offset by a reduction in amortization of other intangible assets that became fully amortized in amortization of intangibles assets in fiscal year was consistent with legal settlement 
in  we incurred a one time charge of million associated with a one time payment to kla tencor under a settlement agreement 
restructuring charge 
the restructuring process was completed in fiscal year  hence there were no restructuring charges in and conversely  as a result of increases in revenue due to the increased capital spending in the semiconductor industry  we increased our headcount in fiscal years and asset impairment 
there were no asset impairment charges in during the fiscal year  we recognized impairment charges of million related to write offs of various it projects  compared to an impairment charge of million in related to the closure of our south korea manufacturing facility 
other income expense  net 
our other income expense  net consisted of the following items in thousands  except percents fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income expense nm total other expense  net nm not meaningful fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income expense nm total other expense  net nm not meaningful during fiscal year interest expense decreased million compared to fiscal year  the decrease was attributed to million of principal payments on the mortgage related to our headquarter facility 
other income decreased by million  to million of expense  principally as a result of million increase in foreign exchange loss  from a gain of million in fiscal to a loss of million in fiscal in addition  other income in included a million gain on the sale of fixed assets that did not recur in during fiscal year our interest expense was relatively flat compared to fiscal year  the slight decrease is attributed to the pay down of million on the mortgage related to our headquarter facility 
other income increased million  due to a million reduction in loss on foreign exchange from million loss in fiscal year to million 
table of contents gain in fiscal year  and due to million change to the fair value of deferred payments to zygo corporation related to our acquisition of certain assets and our entry into a supply agreement with zygo corporation and million gain on sale of assets compared to provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was   and in   and  respectively 
the company s provision for income taxes for of million reflects an effective tax rate of 
this rate differs from the federal statutory rate of due to state income taxes and higher foreign tax expense due to net operating losses without current benefit  partially offset by the domestic production activities deduction and research tax credits 
the company s benefit for income taxes for of million or was primarily due to the decrease in the deferred income tax valuation allowance against us and japan deferred tax assets and the utilization of all of the company s us federal net operating loss carry forwards 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carry back and carry forward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
net income loss 
our net income for the fiscal year was million  compared to net income of million in fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the change in the income tax provision as a result of the one time release benefit of a deferred income tax valuation allowance  which contributed million to net income in the reduction in net income also was a result of the one time expenses incurred in associated with the acquisition of nanda and legal settlement with kla tencor 
these effects were partially offset by an increase in revenue 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and working capital was million  compared to cash of million and working capital of million as of january  undistributed earnings that were not previously taxed amounted to million as of december  operations during year ended december   cash provided by operations was million which reflected net income of million  non cash transactions of million and a million reduction in non cash working capital 
non cash transactions primarily consisted of i depreciation and amortization expense of million ii stock based compensation of million  iii excess tax benefit from equity awards of million  iv inventory write down of million  and v million increase in deferred income taxes 
changes in working capital were mostly due to a million decrease in receivables resulted from timing of sales and collections  an increase in inventory of million  and a million increase in accruals related to million in customer deposits  million in accrued legal settlement  and million in accrued income taxes 
during year ended january   cash provided by operations was million which reflected net income of million  partially offset by non cash transactions of million and a million increase in working capital 
non cash transactions primarily included i million net tax benefit  consisting primarily of a million release of income tax valuation allowance  ii stock based compensation of million  iii depreciation  amortization and impairment expense of million  iv increases in inventory reserves of million 
changes in working capital were mostly due to a million increase in receivables due to higher revenue and timing of collections  an increase of million in inventory and a million increase in payables and accruals as a result of tighter cash management 
during year ended january   operating activities used cash of million primarily as a result of our net loss of million  offset by certain non cash charges including million amortization and depreciation  million of asset impairment  and million of stock based compensation 
on june   we announced a strategic business partnership with zygo corporation whereby we have purchased inventory and certain other assets from zygo corporation  and the two companies have entered into a supply agreement 
we will make payments to zygo corporation with an estimated present value of million as of january  over a period of time as acquired inventory is sold and other aspects of the supply agreement are executed 
a payment of million of inventory and fixed assets was made to zygo corporation on january   in accordance with the terms of the acquisition agreement 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisitions of products  technologies or business that are 
table of contents complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
some of these activities might require significant cash outlays 
investing during the year ended december   investing activities accounted for the use of million of cash  of which million was for the acquisition of nanda  million was for purchases of capital equipment and million was paid to zygo related to royalties and sustaining engineering payments 
during the year ended january   investing activities accounted for the use of million of cash  of which million was for purchases of capital equipment and patents and million was paid to zygo related to inventories and fixed assets associated with the unifire acquisition 
these were offset by million of cash received from the sale of assets  primarily related to the sale of the south korean manufacturing facility 
during the year ended january   cash used of million related to cash outlays of million in capital equipment  offset by net cash received from the release of funds held in escrow in connection with our acquisition of tevet process control technologies  ltd 
tevet 
financing fiscal financing activities contributed million of cash  primarily attributed to million from issuance of common stock for purchases under the employee stock purchase program and the exercise of options and a million excess tax benefit related to equity awards 
these activities were partially offset by million used for repurchases and retirements of our common stock and million paid on the mortgage on our corporate headquarters 
fiscal financing activities contributed million of cash  primarily attributed to million from issuance of common stock for stock options exercised and stock purchased under the employee stock purchase program  partially offset by payment of million on the mortgage on our corporate headquarters and million for repurchases of our common stock 
fiscal financing activities contributed cash of million 
proceeds were from a follow on public offering of our common stock of million  plus million from the issuance of common stock to employees under the company s stock option and stock purchase plan 
this was partially offset by million of repayments for the company s debt obligations 
the follow on public offering of our common stock was completed in december and net proceeds of million were used to repay million of certain obligations related to the company s acquisition of certain assets of zygo corporation in june with the remainder used for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
line of credit in february  we entered into a two year agreement for a revolving line of credit facility with a maximum principal amount of million 
on april   we negotiated an extension to the maturity date of the revolving line of credit facility of an additional two years  to april  on june   we amended the financial covenants governing the credit facility to reduce the tangible net worth requirements  effective as of june  on april   we amended the revolving line of credit facility to i increase the maximum principal amount available there under from million to million  ii extend the maturity date of such facility by one year to april   and iii decrease the unused revolving line commitment fee from per annum to per annum 
the instrument governing the facility includes certain financial covenants regarding net tangible net worth 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on our behalf 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets excluding intellectual property and real estate 
the minimum borrowing interest rate is per annum 
the maximum borrowing allowed on the line of credit is million 
borrowing is limited to the lesser of a million plus the borrowing base or b million
