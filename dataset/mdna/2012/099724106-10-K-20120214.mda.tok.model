the company s management does not expect that the results in any of these commercial and legal claims  actions and complaints will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
litigation in january  borgwarner diversified transmission products inc dtp  a subsidiary of the company  filed a declaratory judgment action in united states district court  southern district of indiana indianapolis division against the united automobile  aerospace  and agricultural implements workers of america uaw local no 
and gerald poor  individually and as the representative of a defendant class 
dtp sought the court s affirmation that dtp did not violate the labor management relations act or the employee retirement income security act erisa by unilaterally amending certain medical plans effective april  and october   prior to the expiration of the then current collective bargaining agreements 
on september   the court found that dtp s reservation of the right to make such amendments reducing the level of benefits provided to retirees was limited by its collectively bargained health insurance agreement with the uaw  which did not expire until april  thus  the amendments were untimely 
in  the company recorded a charge of million as a result of the court s decision

during the last quarter of  the action pending in indiana was dismissed  while the action in michigan is continuing and in the discovery phase 
the company is vigorously defending against the suit 
this contingency is subject to many uncertainties  therefore based on the information available to date  the company cannot reasonably estimate the amount or the range of potential loss  if any 
environmental the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency and certain state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at various hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and equivalent state laws and  as such  may presently be liable for the cost of clean up and other remedial activities at such sites 
responsibility for clean up and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
the company believes that none of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
generally  this is because either the estimates of the maximum potential liability at a site are not material or the liability will be shared with other prps  although no assurance can be given with respect to the ultimate outcome of any such matter 
based on information available to the company which in most cases includes an estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent public companies  will fully pay the cost apportioned to them  currently available information from prps and or federal or state environmental agencies concerning the scope of contamination and estimated remediation and consulting costs  remediation alternatives  and estimated legal fees  the company has an accrual for indicated environmental liabilities with a balance of million at december  the accrued amounts do not exceed million related to any individual site except for the crystal springs site discussed below  and we do not believe that the costs related to any of these sites will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company expects to pay out substantially all of the amounts accrued for environmental liability over the next five years 
in connection with the sale of kuhlman electric corporation  the company agreed to indemnify the buyer and kuhlman electric for certain environmental liabilities  then unknown to the company  relating to certain operations of kuhlman electric that pre date the company s acquisition of kuhlman electric 
in and  lawsuits were filed against kuhlman electric and others  including the company  on behalf of approximately plaintiffs  alleging personal injury relating to alleged environmental contamination at its crystal springs  mississippi plant 
the company entered into a settlement in july regarding the personal injury claims of the plaintiffs and those of approximately  unfiled claimants represented by those plaintiffs attorneys 
in exchange for  among other things  the dismissal with prejudice of these lawsuits and the release of claims by the unfiled claimants  the company agreed to pay up to million in settlement funds  which was expensed in the second quarter of the company paid million in november and made the final payment of million in february litigation concerning indemnification is pending and the company may in the future become subject to further legal proceedings 

table of contents product liability like many other industrial companies who have historically operated in the us  the company or parties the company is obligated to indemnify continues to be named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury actions 
we believe that the company s involvement is limited because  in general  these claims relate to a few types of automotive friction products that were manufactured many years ago and contained encapsulated asbestos 
the nature of the fibers  the encapsulation and the manner of use lead the company to believe that these products are highly unlikely to cause harm 
as of december  and december   the company had approximately  and  pending asbestos related product liability claims  respectively 
of the approximately  outstanding claims at december   approximately half were pending in jurisdictions that have undergone significant tort and judicial reform activities subsequent to the filing of these claims 
the company s policy is to vigorously defend against these lawsuits and the company has been successful in obtaining dismissal of many claims without any payment 
the company expects that the vast majority of the pending asbestos related product liability claims where it is a defendant or has an obligation to indemnify a defendant will result in no payment being made by the company or its insurers 
in  of the approximately  claims resolved  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
in the full year of  of the approximately  claims resolved  resulted in any payment being made to a claimant by or on behalf of the company 
prior to june  the settlement and defense costs associated with all claims were paid by the company s primary layer insurance carriers under a series of funding arrangements 
in addition to the primary insurance available for asbestos related claims  the company has substantial excess insurance coverage available for potential future asbestos related product claims 
in june  primary layer insurance carriers notified the company of the alleged exhaustion of their policy limits 
a declaratory judgment action was filed in january in the circuit court of cook county  illinois by continental casualty company and related companies cna against the company and certain of its other historical general liability insurers 
the court has issued a number of interim rulings and discovery is continuing 
cna and the company have entered into a settlement agreement resolving their coverage disputes  pursuant to which cna will pay amounts over the next four years to the company 
the company is vigorously pursuing the litigation against the remaining insurers 
although it is impossible to predict the outcome of pending or future claims or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels  due to the encapsulated nature of the products  the company s experience in vigorously defending and resolving claims in the past  and the company s significant insurance coverage with solvent carriers as of the date of this filing  management does not believe that asbestos related product liability claims are likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
to date  the company has paid and accrued million in defense and indemnity in advance of insurers reimbursement and has received million in cash and notes from insurers  including cna 
the net balance of million  is expected to be fully recovered  of which approximately million is estimated to be recovered within one year 
timing of recovery is dependent on final resolution of the declaratory judgment action referred to above or additional negotiated settlements 
at december   insurers owed million in association with these claims 
on april   the superior court of new jersey appellate division affirmed a lower court judgment in an asbestos related action against the company and others 
the company filed its notice of petition to the supreme court of new jersey in late april  seeking to appeal the decisions of the lower courts 
on july  the supreme court of new jersey denied the company s notice of petition appealing the decision of the lower courts 
the total claim of million was paid by the company in july 
table of contents in addition to the million net balance relating to past settlements and defense costs  the company has estimated a liability of million for claims asserted  but not yet resolved and their related defense costs at december  the company also has a related asset of million to recognize proceeds from the insurance carriers 
insurance carrier reimbursement of is expected based on the company s experience  its insurance contracts and decisions received to date in the declaratory judgment action referred to above 
at december   the comparable value of the insurance asset and accrued liability was million 
the amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to the estimated future settlement of existing claims are as follows december  millions of dollars assets prepayments and other current assets other non current assets total insurance assets liabilities accounts payable and accrued expenses other non current liabilities total accrued liabilities the company cannot reasonably estimate possible losses  if any  in excess of those for which it has accrued  because it cannot predict how many additional claims may be brought against the company or parties the company has an obligation to indemnify in the future  the allegations in such claims  the possible outcomes  or the impact of tort reform legislation that may be enacted at the state or federal levels 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
some of these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements and accompanying notes 
management makes estimates and assumptions about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain  relating to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our most critical accounting policies are discussed below 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the accompanying notes  as well as  the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the periods covered by these financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss pass to the customer  which is usually upon shipment of product 
although the company may enter into long term supply agreements with its major customers  each shipment of goods is treated as a separate sale and the prices are not fixed over the life of the agreements 

table of contents cost of sales the company includes materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead within cost of sales 
manufacturing overhead is comprised of indirect materials  indirect labor  factory operating costs and other such costs associated with manufacturing products for sale 
impairment of long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  whether held for use or disposal  including other amortizable intangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such a review under accounting standards codification asc topic a recoverability review is performed using the undiscounted cash flows if there is a triggering event 
if the undiscounted cash flow test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment  management will perform a fair value analysis 
management determines fair value under asc topic using the appropriate valuation technique of market  income or cost approach 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value assumptions are reasonable  however  changes in assumptions underlying these estimates could affect the valuations 
long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
significant judgments and estimates used by management when evaluating long lived assets for impairment include i an assessment as to whether an adverse event or circumstance has triggered the need for an impairment review  ii undiscounted future cash flows generated by the asset  and iii fair value of the asset 
the company recognized million of asset impairment charges during the year ended december  within restructuring expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
see note  restructuring  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s impairment of long lived assets and a discussion of market based measurements 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year or upon a triggering event  the company reviews the goodwill assigned to each of its reporting units to identify those units with a fair value more likely than not less than its carrying value 
with the exception of two reporting units that had recent acquisition or divestiture activity  a qualitative assessment was completed 
this assessment evaluated various events and circumstances  such as macro economic conditions  industry and market conditions  cost factors  relevant events and financial trends  that may impact a reporting unit s fair value 
after completing this assessment  the company determined it was more likely than not the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting units qualitatively reviewed 
a quantitative  step one  impairment analysis  therefore  was not required 
for the two reporting units with recent acquisition or divestiture activity  the company performed a quantitative  step one  goodwill impairment analysis  which requires the company to make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows  discount rates and growth rates 
the basis of this goodwill impairment analysis is the company s annual budget and long range plan lrp 
the annual budget and lrp includes a five year projection of future cash flows based on actual new products and customer commitments and assumes the last year of the lrp data is a fair indication of the future performance 
because the lrp is estimated over a significant future period of time  those estimates and assumptions are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
further  the market valuation models and other financial ratios used by the company require certain assumptions and estimates regarding the applicability of those models to the company s facts and circumstances 
the company believes the assumptions and estimates used to determine its estimated fair value are reasonable 
different assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value 

table of contents the primary assumptions affecting the company s december  goodwill quantitative  step one  impairment review are as follows discount rate the company used a weighted average cost of capital wacc as the discount rate for future cash flows 
the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market participant 
operating income margin the company used historical and expected operating income margins  which may vary based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated 
in addition to the above primary assumptions  the company notes the following risk to volume and operating income assumptions that could have an impact on the discounted cash flow model the automotive industry is cyclical and the company s results of operations would be adversely affected by industry downturns 
the company is dependent on market segments that use our key products and would be affected by decreasing demand in those segments 
the company is subject to risks related to international operations 
based on the assumptions outlined above  the impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter of indicated the company s goodwill assigned to the two reporting units that were quantitatively assessed was not impaired 
additionally  a sensitivity analysis was completed indicating a increase in the discount rate or a decrease in the operating margin assumptions would not result in the carrying value exceeding the fair value of either of the reporting units quantitatively assessed 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill 
product warranties the company provides warranties on some  but not all  of its products 
the warranty terms are typically from one to three years 
provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranty are made at the time products are sold 
these estimates are established using historical information about the nature  frequency and average cost of warranty claim settlements as well as product manufacturing and industry developments and recoveries from third parties 
management actively studies trends of warranty claims and takes action to improve product quality and minimize warranty claims 
management believes that the warranty accrual is appropriate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the accrual 
our warranty provision over the last three years  and as a percentage of net sales  has trended as follows year ended december  millions of dollars net sales warranty provision warranty provision as a percentage of net sales 
table of contents the following table illustrates the sensitivity of a basis point change as a percentage of net sales in the assumed warranty trend on the company s accrued warranty liability december  millions of dollars basis point decrease income expense basis point increase income expense at december   the total accrued warranty liability was million 
the accrual is represented as million in current liabilities and million in non current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding product warranties 
other loss accruals and valuation allowances the company has numerous other loss exposures  such as customer claims  workers compensation claims  litigation and recoverability of assets 
establishing loss accruals or valuation allowances for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment in regard to the risk exposure and ultimate realization 
the company estimates losses under the programs using consistent and appropriate methods  however  changes to its assumptions could materially affect the recorded accrued liabilities for loss or asset valuation allowances 
environmental contingencies the company works with outside experts to determine a range of potential liability for environmental sites 
the ranges for each individual site are then aggregated into a loss range for the total accrued liability 
management s estimate of the loss range for environmental liability  including conditional asset retirement obligations  for is between approximately million and million 
we record an accrual at the most probable amount within the range unless one cannot be determined  in which case we record the accrual at the low end of the range 
at december   our total accrued environmental liability was million  which includes our conditional asset retirement obligation under asc topic of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding environmental accrual 
pension and other post employment defined benefits the company provides post employment defined benefits to a number of its current and former employees 
costs associated with post employment defined benefits include pension and post employment health care expenses for employees  retirees and surviving spouses and dependents 
the company s defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with asc topic disability  early retirement and other postemployment employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with asc topic the determination of the company s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits  such as retiree health care  is dependent on certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
certain assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rate  rates of increase in compensation and health care costs trends are described in note  retirement benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
the effects of any modification to those assumptions are either recognized immediately or amortized over future periods in accordance with gaap 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and generally amortized over future periods 
the primary assumptions affecting the company s accounting for employee benefits under asc topics and as of december  are as follows 
table of contents expected long term rate of return on plan assets the expected long term rate of return is used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost 
the required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been determined based on various inputs  including historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company s trusts and its asset allocation  as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding expected capital market return  inflation and other variables 
the company also considers the impact of active management of the plans invested assets 
in determining its pension expense for the year ended december   the company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from to outside of the us and in the us actual returns on us pension assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the expected rate of return assumption of for the years ended december   and  respectively 
actual returns on uk pension assets were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  compared to the expected rate of return assumption of for the years ended december   and  respectively 
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee benefit obligations opeb 
the discount rate assumption is based on a constant effective yield from matching projected plan cash flows to high quality aa bond yields of corresponding maturities as of the measurement date 
the company used discount rates ranging from to to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december   including weighted average discount rates of in the us  outside of the us  and for us other post employment health care plans 
the us discount rate reflects the fact that our us pension plan has been closed for new participants since for our us health care plan  and with the closing of our muncie facility in  there will be negligible service cost going forward 
health care cost trend for postretirement employee health care plan accounting  the company reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care cost to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions 
in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december   the company used health care cost trend rates of  declining to an ultimate trend rate of by the year while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and us pension plans on its pre tax pension expense millions of dollars impact on us pre tax pension expense income impact on non us pre tax pension expense income percentage point decrease in discount rate percentage point increase in discount rate percentage point decrease in expected return on assets percentage point increase in expected return on assets a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have a negligible impact on the company s us pre tax pension expense 

table of contents the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company s us opeb interest expense millions of dollars impact on pre tax opeb interest expense income percentage point decrease in discount rate percentage point increase in discount rate the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to the company s total us opeb expense is expected to be negligible  as any increase in interest expense will be offset by net actuarial gains 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend related to the company s opeb obligation and service and interest cost one percentage point millions of dollars increase decrease effect on other post employment benefit obligation effect on total service and interest cost components see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the company s retirement benefit plans 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in  the company recorded a valuation allowance that primarily represented foreign net operating losses and us based foreign tax credits for which utilization was uncertain 
in  the company recorded a reversal of the company s million valuation allowance on us based foreign tax credit carryforwards 
management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  the historical and projected financial performance of the operation recording the net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information 
since future financial results may differ from previous estimates  periodic adjustments to the company s valuation allowance may be necessary 
the company is subject to income taxes in the us at the federal and state level and numerous non us jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is less than certain 
accruals for income tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of asc topic the company s us federal and certain state income tax returns and certain non us income tax returns are currently under various stages of audit by applicable tax authorities 
although the outcome of ongoing tax audits is always uncertain  management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax 
table of contents returns and that its annual tax provisions included amounts sufficient to pay assessments  if any  which may be proposed by the taxing authorities 
at december   the company has recorded a liability for its best estimate of the more likely than not loss on certain of its tax positions  which is included in other non current liabilities 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year

table of contents quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we are also affected by changes in the prices of commodities used or consumed in our manufacturing operations 
some of our commodity purchase price risk is covered by supply agreements with customers and suppliers 
other commodity purchase price risk is addressed by hedging strategies  which include forward contracts 
the company enters into derivative instruments only with high credit quality counterparties and diversifies its positions across such counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to credit losses 
we do not engage in any derivative instruments for purposes other than hedging specific operating risks 
we have established policies and procedures to manage sensitivity to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate and commodity purchase price risk  which include monitoring the level of exposure to each market risk 
for quantitative disclosures about market risk  please refer to note  financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for information with respect to interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
the company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs 
the company selectively uses interest rate swaps to reduce market value risk associated with changes in interest rates fair value hedges 
at december   the amount of debt with fixed interest rates was of total debt  including the impact of the interest rate swaps 
our earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to floating money market rates 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company also measures interest rate risk by estimating the net amount by which the fair value of all of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities would be impacted by selected hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates as of december   the net fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million 
assuming a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates as of december   the net fair value of these instruments would decrease by approximately million 
our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes a constant shift in interest rate yield curves 
the model  therefore  does not reflect the potential impact of changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity at december   measured in a similar manner  was slightly less than at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
currently  our most significant currency exposures relate to the british pound  the euro  the hungarian forint  the japanese yen  the swedish krona and the south korean won 
we mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk by establishing local production facilities and related supply chain participants in the markets we serve  by invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of the products and by funding some of our investments in foreign markets through local currency loans and cross currency swaps 
such non us dollar debt was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also monitor our foreign currency exposure in each country and implement strategies to respond to changing economic and political environments 
in addition  the company periodically enters into forward currency contracts in order to reduce exposure to exchange rate 
table of contents risk related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
as of december   the company was holding foreign exchange derivatives with positive and negative fair market values of million and million  respectively  of which million in gains and million in losses mature in less than one year 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products 
commodity forward and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals and natural gas consumption used in the manufacturing of vehicle components 
as of december   the company had no forward and option commodity contracts outstanding
