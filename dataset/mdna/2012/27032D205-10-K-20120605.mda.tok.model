reserves as of march   our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves in barrels of oil equivalent boe was  a increase from the prior year end s estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves of  boe 
this increase primarily reflects the addition of new wells  along with an increase in the life of existing wells due to an increase in oil and natural gas prices 
geographically  our reported reserves are located in two primary areas the williston basin in north dakota and montana and onshore south texas 
while we hold interests in producing wells outside of these two primary locations  we are not reporting reserves for such properties due to their insignificance

all of our reported oil and natural gas reserves have been estimated as of march   by the ryder scott company ryder scott of houston  texas 
as of march   ryder scott estimated reserves for properties located in the states of montana  north dakota  and texas  comprising of the pv of our oil and gas reserves as of that date 
ryder scott is an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm that has been providing petroleum consulting services throughout the world for over seventy years 
ryder scott is employee owned and maintains offices in houston  texas  denver  colorado  and calgary  alberta  canada 
ryder scott has over eighty engineers and geoscientists on their permanent staff 
the office of ryder scott that prepared our reserves estimates is registered in the state of texas license f 
ryder scott prepared our reserve estimate based upon a review of property interests being appraised  historical production  lease operating expenses and price differentials for our wells 
additionally  authorizations for expenditure afes  geological and geophysical data  and other engineering data that complies with sec guidelines are among that which we provide to such engineer for consideration in estimating our underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas 
this information was reviewed by ray singleton  our president and chief executive officer  to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data prior to and after submission to ryder scott 
mr 
singleton received a bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering from texas a m university 
in his capacity as an engineer  mr 
singleton prepared reserve and economic estimates during his employment with both amoco production company and champlin petroleum 
mr 
singleton continued providing economic evaluations for approximately different clients through his engineering consulting firm  singleton associates  from to  and thereafter for earthstone energy  inc since his employment in in addition  mr

technologies used in preparation of proved reserves estimates all of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells and or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods 
these performance methods used are limited to decline curve analysis which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through march  the data used in this analysis was obtained from public data sources and was considered sufficient for calculating producing reserves 
the proved undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method 
the analogy method uses pertinent well data obtained from public data sources that were available through march  oil and gas reserves and the estimates of the present value of future net revenues were determined based on prices and costs as prescribed by sec and fasb guidelines 
reserve calculations involve the estimate of future net recoverable reserves of oil and gas and the timing and amount of future net revenues to be received 
such estimates are not precise and are based on assumptions regarding a variety of factors  many of which are variable and uncertain 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are those expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved reserves were estimated in accordance with guidelines established by the sec and fasb  which require that reserves estimates be prepared under existing economic and operating conditions with no provision for price and cost escalations except by contractual arrangements 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding estimates of our oil and gas reserves as of march  all of our reserves are located in the united states 
estimated proved developed and undeveloped oil and gas reserves proved developed producing non producing proved undeveloped total proved net remaining reserves oil condensate bbls plant products bbls gas mcf the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and involves decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from those estimated 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this annual report on form k 
in addition  estimates of proved reserves are subject to revision to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered and are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they are based 
additional information pertaining to our proved reserves is set forth under the heading unaudited oil and gas reserves information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this annual report on form k

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the other information appearing in this report 
as used in this report  unless the context otherwise indicates  references to we  our  ours  and us refer to earthstone energy  inc and its subsidiary collectively 
as an oil and natural gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil and natural gas 
declines in commodity prices will materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of crude oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global  political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for crude oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is to a large extent determined by factors beyond our control 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity outlook 
our primary source of funding is the net cash flow from the sale of our oil and natural gas production 
the profitability and cash flow generated by our operations in any particular accounting period will be directly related to a the volume of oil and gas produced and sold  b the average realized prices for oil and gas sold  and c lifting costs 
at the current price of oil  we believe the cash generated from operations  along with existing cash balances  should enable us to meet our existing and normal recurring obligations during the next year and beyond 
overview of our capital structure 
we recognize the importance of developing our capital resource base in order to pursue our objectives 
however  subsequent to our last public offering in  debt financing has been the sole source of external funding 
in addition to our routine production related costs  general and administrative expenses and  when necessary  debt repayment requirements  we require capital to fund our exploratory and development drilling efforts and the acquisition of additional properties as well as the enhancement of held and newly acquired properties 
we have received numerous inquiries regarding the possibility of funding our efforts through equity contributions or debt instruments 
given strong cash flows  and the relatively modest nature of our current drilling projects  we have thus far declined these overtures 
our primary concern in this area is the dilution of our existing shareholders 
however  going forward  given that one of the key components of our growth strategy is to expand our oil and natural gas reserve base through drilling and or acquisitions  if we were presented with a significant opportunity and available cash and bank debt financing were insufficient  it is possible we would consider alternative forms of additional financing 
hedging 
during the years ended march  and  we did not participate in any hedging activities  nor did we have any open futures or option contracts 
additional information concerning our hedging activities appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
working capital 
as of march   we had a working capital surplus of  a current ratio of compared to a working capital surplus as of march  of  a current ratio of 
the decrease in current ratio is primarily a result of the use of cash for the acquisition  development and exploration of oil and gas properties 
cash flow 
cash provided by operating activities doubled from  for the year ended march  to  for the year ended march  this change related primarily to the timing and collection of accounts receivable and the timing and payment of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
overall  net cash used in investing activities decreased from the previous year from  for the year ended march  to  for the year ended march  however  in  investments in drilling and completion activities were significantly greater when compared to the prior year  but were partially offset by the sale of wells in colorado during the most recent fiscal year 
during the year ended march    was expended on the acquisition of producing properties  new horizontal bakken wells in the williston basin and on additional acreage  as compared to  during the year ended march  net cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was  utilized entirely for treasury share acquisition 
during the year ended march    was used to purchase treasury shares 
the company s share buyback program was adopted in october and will terminate in october  if not extended before then 
capital expenditures the amounts presented herein are presented on an accrual basis  and as such may not be consistent with the amounts presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows under investing activities for expenditures on oil and gas property  which are presented on a cash basis 
during the year ended march   we spent  on various projects 
this compares to  for the year ended march  during the year ended march   capital expenditures were comprised of drilling and completions of wells producing as of year end  drilling of wells to be completed as of calendar year end  converting unproductive wells to disposal wells  leasehold  and acquisitions of producing properties 
the remaining of costs were primarily dedicated to recompleting existing wells 
the majority of capital expenditures occurred in the williston basin 
the remainder was spent in other areas on property improvements and leasehold acreage 
these projects were funded entirely with internally generated cash flow 
as of march   we have afes totaling  for our share in completion costs of new wells in which we share a working interest 
at present cash flow levels  we expect to have sufficient funds available for our share of both the outstanding afes and any additional acreage  seismic and or drilling cost requirements that might arise from our existing opportunities 
we may alter or vary all or part of any planned capital expenditures for reasons including  but not limited to changes in circumstances  unforeseen opportunities  the inability to negotiate favorable acquisition  farmout  joint venture or divestiture terms  commodity prices  lack of cash flow  and lack of additional funding 
we are continually evaluating drilling and acquisition opportunities for possible participation 
typically  at any one time  several opportunities are in various stages of evaluation 
our policy is to not disclose the specifics of a project or prospect  nor to speculate on such ventures  until such time as those various opportunities are finalized and undertaken 
we caution that the absence of news and or press releases should not be interpreted as a lack of development or activity 
divestitures abandonments on january   we completed the divestiture and sale of the company s working and or override interests in wells in weld county  colorado to an unrelated third party for  after customary adjustments and expenses  the net proceeds from the transaction were  the adjusted purchase price was impacted by commissions  sales costs and post effective date revenue and expense modifications to the purchase price 
the wells were considered non core properties for the company  given the company s focus on other areas  primarily the williston basin 
impact of inflation and pricing we deal primarily in us dollars 
inflation has not had a material impact on the company in recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation in the united states 
however  the oil and natural gas industry can be cyclical and the demand for production places pressure on the economic stability and pricing within the industry 
typically  as prices for oil and natural gas increase  associated costs rise 
conversely  cost declines are likely to lag and may not adjust downward in proportion to declining prices 
changes in prices impact our revenues  estimates of reserves  assessments of any impairment of oil and natural gas properties  as well as values of properties being acquired or sold 
price changes have the potential to affect our ability to raise capital  borrow money  and retain personnel 
while we do not presently expect business costs to materially rise  higher prices for oil and natural gas could result in increases in the costs of materials  services and personnel 
other commitments other than the aforementioned outstanding afes  we do not have any other commitments beyond our office lease and software maintenance contracts

results of operations selected financial information the following provides selected financial information and averages for the years ended march  and certain prior year amounts may have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
year ended march  revenue oil gas total revenue total production expense gross profit depletion expense sales volume oil bbls gas mcf average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf average per boe production expense  gross profit depletion expense due to the timing and accuracy of sales information received from a third party operator as described in volumes and prices below  sales volume amounts may not be indicative of actual production or future performance 
amount does not include water service and disposal revenue 
for the year ended march   this revenue amount is net of  in well service and water disposal revenue  which would otherwise total  in revenue for the year ended march   compared to  to total  for the year ended march  overall lifting cost oil and gas production expenses and production taxes averages calculated based upon non rounded figures the year ended march  compared with the year ended march  overview 
net income for the year ended march   was double that of the previous year at  compared to  for the year ended march  the increase in the sales price per barrel of oil equivalent boe and rise in sales volumes  offset by increases in production costs and general and administrative g a expense  resulted in the increase in net income 
revenues 
oil and natural gas sales revenue increased  for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march   due to an overall higher realized price per boe  and overall increase in sales volumes 
volumes and prices 
on an equivalent barrel basis  sales were  boe for the year ended march  compared to  boe for the year ended march  oil sales volumes increased from  barrels for the year ended march  to  barrels for the year ended march   while the average price per barrel increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  the rise in oil volumes resulted from production from the newly producing wells offset  expectedly  by declines in existing wells 
natural gas sales volumes increased from  mcf for the year ended march  to  mcf for the year ended march   while the average price per mcf dropped  from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  production expenses 
production expenses are comprised of the following items year ended march  lease operating expenses production taxes workover expenses transportation and other expenses oil and natural gas production expense increased  for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  the two principal components of oil and gas production expense are routine lease operating expenses loe and workovers 
routine expenses typically include such items as daily well maintenance  utilities  fuel  water disposal and minor surface equipment repairs 
workovers primarily include downhole repairs and are generally random in nature 
although workovers are expected  they can be much more frequent in some wells than others and their associated costs can be significant 
therefore  workovers account for more dramatic fluctuations in oil and gas expense from period to period 
loe  production taxes  and transportation and other expenses increased     and   respectively  for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  all fluctuate with sales revenue  which increased year over year 
production taxes as a percent of oil and natural gas sales revenue were comparable year over year at versus 
workover expense decreased  for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  the overall lifting cost oil and natural gas production expense plus production taxes per boe increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  this increase resulted from the increase loe described above 
this lifting cost per equivalent barrel is not indicative of all wells  and certain high cost wells could be shut in should oil prices drop below certain levels 
other expenses 
depletion and depreciation expense decreased  for the year ended march  as compared to the year ended march  due to the disposition of d j basin properties in  somewhat offset by new wells 
depletion expense per boe decreased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  general and administrative g a expense rose  for the year ended march   as compared to the year ended march  eighty percent of this increase relates to personnel costs  as additional management  staff and a board member were added in state franchise taxes resulted in of the rise in costs 
the sum of various other administrative costs account for the remaining fluctuation in the expense 
as a percent of total sales revenue  g a expense remained steady at both years 
income tax 
for the year ended march   we recorded income tax expense of  this amount consisted of a current period expense of  and deferred tax expense of  our effective income tax rate increased from for the year ended march  to for the year ended march  our effective income tax rate was higher for the year ended march   primarily due to the tax gain on the sale of the d j basin properties  offset by the utilization of greater percentage depletion as a result of recognizing the gain from the these properties
