application of critical accounting policies our audited financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
we believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our consolidated financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financials 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes  including estimates of ultimate revenues and ultimate costs of film and television products  estimates of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that ultimately will be collected  the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements and loss contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  the company s financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
estimates are based on past experience and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances  and management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
fair value of financial instruments the fair value of financial instruments  which consist of cash  accounts receivable  notes receivable  prepaid and other assets  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  due to related parties and short term debt  were estimated to approximate their carrying values due to the immediate or relatively short maturity of these instruments 
cost of revenues film costs we capitalize film costs in accordance with asc film costs are stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated amortization  or fair value 
production overhead  a component of film costs  includes allocable costs of individuals or departments with exclusive or significant responsibility for the production of films 
substantially all of our resources are dedicated to the production of our films 
capitalized production overhead does not include selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense on funds invested in production is capitalized into film costs until production is completed 
in addition to the films being produced  costs of productions in development are capitalized as development film costs in accordance with the provisions of the asc and are transferred to film production costs when a film is set for production 
in the event a film is not set for production within three years from the time the first costs are capitalized or the film is abandoned  all such costs are generally expensed 
film cost amortization once a film is released  film costs are amortized and participations and residual costs are accrued on an individual film basis in the proportion that the revenue during the period for each film current revenue bears to the estimated remaining total revenue to be received from all sources for each film ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the current fiscal period as required by the asc 
the amount of film costs that is amortized each period will depend on the ratio of current revenue to ultimate revenue for each film for such period 
we make certain estimates and judgments of ultimate revenue to be received for each film based on information received from our distributor and our knowledge of the industry 
ultimate revenue does not include estimates of revenue that will be earned beyond ten years of a film s initial theatrical release date 
unamortized film production costs are evaluated for impairment each reporting period on a film by film basis in accordance with the requirements of the asc 
if estimated remaining net cash flows are not sufficient to recover the unamortized film costs for that film  the unamortized film costs will be written down to fair value determined using a net present value calculation 
earnings loss per share the company calculates net income loss per share in accordance with asc  earnings per share 
basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period 
diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock  common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period 
as of june  and  respectively  the company had no common stock equivalents that could potentially dilute future earnings per share
