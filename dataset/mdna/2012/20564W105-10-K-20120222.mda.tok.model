our company was founded in august in  we completed our initial public offering 
we have complemented our internal development initiatives with select acquisitions 
in february  we acquired the outstanding stock of arsgroup  inc to expand our ability to provide our customers with actionable information to improve their creative and strategic messaging targeted against specific audiences 
in july  we acquired the outstanding stock of nexius  inc  a provider of products to the large mobile networks that deliver network analysis focused on the experience of wireless subscribers  as well as network intelligence with respect to performance  capacity and configuration analytics 
in august  we acquired the outstanding stock of nedstat bv  a provider of web analytics and innovative video measurement solutions based out of amsterdam  netherlands 
in august  we acquired all of the outstanding equity of adxpose  inc  a provider of digital advertising analytics solutions based out of seattle  washington 
since our initial public offering in  our revenues and expenses have grown significantly 
we attribute the growth in our revenue and expenses primarily to increased sales to existing customers  as a result of our efforts to deepen our relationships with these customers by increasing their awareness of  and confidence in  the value of our digital marketing intelligence platform  growth in our customer base through the addition of new customers and from acquired businesses  the sales of new products to existing and new customers  and growth in sales outside of the us  as a result of entering into new international markets 
as a result of the economic events over the last several years  such as the global financial crisis in the credit markets  softness in the housing markets  difficulties in the financial services sector and political uncertainty in the middle east  the direction and relative strength of the us and global economies have become somewhat uncertain 
during  we experienced a limited number of our current and potential customers ceasing  delaying or reducing renewals of existing subscriptions and purchases of new or additional services and products presumably due to the economic downturn 
further  certain of our existing customers exited the market due to industry consolidation and bankruptcy in connection with these challenging economic conditions 
during  the us and other economies showed slow signs of recovery 
nonetheless  we continued to add net new customers and our existing customers renewed their subscriptions at a rate of over based on dollars renewed during if economic recovery slows or adverse economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the fees that we charge for subscription based products  customized projects  and software licenses 
we define subscription based revenues as revenues that we generate from products that we deliver to a customer on a recurring basis 
we define project revenues as revenues that we generate from customized projects that are performed for a specific customer on a non recurring basis 
a significant characteristic of our saas based business model is our large percentage of subscription based contracts 
subscription based revenues accounted for of total revenues in the years ended december  and many of our customers who initially purchased a customized project have subsequently purchased one of our subscription based products 
similarly  many of our subscription based customers have subsequently purchased additional customized projects 

table of contents historically  we have generated most of our revenues from the sale and delivery of our products to companies and organizations located within the united states 
we intend to expand our international revenues by selling our products and deploying our direct sales force model in additional international markets in the future 
for the year ended december   our international revenues were million  an increase of million  or over international revenues of million for the year ended december  international revenues comprised approximately  and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december   and we anticipate that revenues from our us customers will continue to constitute the substantial majority of our revenues  but we expect that revenues from customers outside of the us will increase as a percentage of total revenues as we build greater international recognition of our brand and expand our sales operations globally 
subscription revenues we generate a significant proportion of our subscription based revenues from our media metrix product suite 
products within the media metrix suite include media metrix  media metrix  plan metrix  world metrix  video metrix and ad metrix 
these product offerings provide subscribers with intelligence on digital media usage  audience characteristics  audience demographics and online and offline purchasing behavior 
customers who subscribe to our media metrix products are provided with login ids to our web site  have access to our database and can generate reports at anytime 
we also generate subscription based revenues from certain reports and analyses provided through our customer research product  if that work is procured by customers for at least a nine month period and the customer enters into an agreement to continue or extend the work 
through our customer research products  we deliver digital marketing intelligence relating to specific industries  such as automotive  consumer packaged goods  entertainment  financial services  media  pharmaceutical  retail  technology  telecommunications and travel 
this marketing intelligence leverages our global consumer panel and extensive database to deliver information unique to a particular customer s needs on a recurring schedule  as well as on a continual access basis 
our marketing solutions customer agreements typically include a fixed fee with an initial term of at least one year 
we also provide these products on a non subscription basis as described under project revenues below 
in addition  we generate subscription based revenues from survey products that we sell to our customers 
in conducting our surveys  we generally use our global internet user panel 
after questionnaires are distributed to the panel members and completed  we compile their responses and then deliver our findings to the customer  who also has ongoing access to the survey response data as they are compiled and updated over time 
these data include responses and information collected from the actual survey questionnaires and can also include behavioral information that we passively collect from our panelists 
if a customer contractually commits to having a survey conducted on a recurring basis  we classify the revenues generated from such survey products as subscription based revenues 
our contracts for survey services typically include a fixed fee with terms that range from two months to one year 
on august   we completed our acquisition of nedstat  resulting in additional revenue sources  including software subscriptions  server calls  and professional services including training and consulting 
our arrangements generally contain multiple elements  consisting of the various service offerings 
on august   the company completed the acquisition of adxpose  resulting in additional revenue sources  including fees for the use of the adxpose platform 
fees for the use of the adxpose platform are generally a fixed fee for each impression that is generated using the adxpose technology 
revenue is recognized on a usage basis when the impression is delivered and reported via the adxpose service portal 

table of contents project revenues we generate project revenues by providing customized information reports to our customers on a nonrecurring basis through comscore marketing solutions 
for example  a customer in the media industry might request a custom report that profiles the behavior of the customer s active online users and contrasts their market share and loyalty with similar metrics for a competitor s online user base 
if this customer continues to request the report beyond an initial project term of at least nine months and enters into an agreement to purchase the report on a recurring basis  we begin to classify these future revenues as subscription based 
software licenses on july   we completed our acquisition of nexius  resulting in additional revenue sources  including software licenses  professional services including software customization  implementation  training and consulting services  and maintenance and technical support contracts 
we recognize software license arrangements that include significant modification and customization of the software in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc  software recognition  and asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts  typically using the completed contract method 
prior to march   we had not established vsoe of fair value for the multiple deliverables and therefore accounted for all elements in these arrangements as a single unit of accounting  recognizing the entire arrangement fee as revenue on a straight line basis over the service period of the last delivered element 
during the period of performance  billings and costs to the extent they are recoverable are accumulated on the balance sheet  but no profit or income is recorded before user acceptance of the software license 
to the extent estimated costs are expected to exceed revenue  we accrue for costs immediately 
during the quarter ended june  we established vsoe of fair value for post contract support pcs services for certain nexius customers 
the establishment of vsoe of fair value followed an alignment of our pricing practices for these services 
as a result of establishing vsoe  for the year ended december   we recorded revenue and related costs of revenue of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  had been previously deferred 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generate revenues by providing access to our online database or delivering information obtained from our database  usually in the form of periodic reports 
revenues are typically recognized on a straight line basis over the period in which access to data or reports is provided  which generally ranges from three to twenty four months 

table of contents we also generate revenues through survey services under contracts ranging in term from two months to one year 
our survey services consist of survey and questionnaire design with subsequent data collection  analysis and reporting 
at the outset of an arrangement  we allocate total arrangement consideration between the development of the survey questionnaire and subsequent data collection  analysis and reporting services based on relative selling price 
we recognize revenue allocated to the survey questionnaire when it is delivered and we recognize revenue allocated to the data collection  analysis and reporting services on a straight line basis over the estimated data collection period once the survey or questionnaire design has been delivered 
any change in the estimated data collection period results in an adjustment to revenues recognized in future periods 
certain of our arrangements contain multiple elements  consisting of the various services we offer 
multiple element arrangements typically consist of either subscriptions to multiple online product solutions or a subscription to our online database combined with customized services 
prior to january   we had determined there was not objective and reliable evidence of fair value for any of our services and  therefore  accounted for all elements in multiple element arrangements as a single unit of accounting 
access to data under the subscription element is generally provided shortly after the execution of the contract 
however  the initial delivery of customized services generally occurs subsequent to the commencement of the subscription element 
for these historical arrangements  we recognized the entire arrangement fee over the performance period of the last deliverable 
as a result  the total arrangement fee is recognized on a straight line basis over the period beginning with the commencement of the last element deliverable 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which requires us to allocate arrangement consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables  if they represent a separate unit of accounting  based on their relative selling prices 
in addition  this guidance eliminated the use of the residual method for allocating arrangement consideration 
this guidance is applicable to us for all arrangements entered into subsequent to december  and for any existing arrangements that are materially modified after december  for these types of arrangements  the guidance establishes a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating arrangement consideration to deliverables i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe if vsoe is not available  or iii an estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable on a stand alone basis 
esp reflects our estimate of what the selling price of a deliverable would be if it was sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
we have concluded that we do not have vsoe  for these types of arrangements  and tpe is generally not available because our service offerings are highly differentiated and we are unable to obtain reliable information on the products and pricing practices of our competitors 
as such  esp is used to allocate the total arrangement consideration at the arrangement inception based on each element s relative selling price 
our process for determining esp involves management s judgments based on multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each product suite and deliverable 
we determine esp by considering several external and internal factors including  but not limited to  current pricing practices  pricing concentrations such as industry  channel  customer class or geography  internal costs and market penetration of a product or service 
the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each of the elements based on the relative selling price 
if the esp is determined as a range of selling prices  the mid point of the range is used in the relative selling price method 
once the total arrangement consideration has been allocated to each deliverable based on the relative allocation of the arrangement fee  we commence revenue recognition for each deliverable on a stand alone basis as the data or service is delivered 

table of contents the impact of adopting this new revenue recognition guidance  including arrangements that were materially modified  for the year ended december  is that we recognized approximately million in revenue and expenses of approximately million that otherwise would have been recognized in future periods under the previous revenue recognition guidance 
esp is analyzed on an annual basis or more frequently if we deem it likely that changes in the estimated selling prices have occurred 
in the future  as our pricing strategies and market conditions change  modifications may occur in the determination of esp to reflect these changes 
as a result  the future revenue recognized for these arrangements could differ from the results in the current period 
generally  our contracts are non refundable and non cancelable 
in the event a portion of a contract is refundable  revenue recognition is delayed until the refund provisions lapse 
a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing us with written notice of cancellation 
in the event that a customer cancels its contract  it is not entitled to a refund for prior services  and it will be charged for costs incurred plus services performed up to the cancellation date 
in connection with our acquisition of nexius  inc  we acquired additional revenue sources  including software licenses  professional services including software customization implementation  training and consulting services  and maintenance and technical support contracts 
our arrangements generally contain multiple elements  consisting of the various service offerings 
we recognize software license arrangements that include significant modification and customization of the software in accordance with asc  software recognition and asc  revenue recognition construction type and certain production type contracts  typically using the completed contract method 
during the quarter ended june   we established vsoe of fair value for post contract support services for a group of certain nexius customers 
for these specific arrangements  we allocate the total consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on vsoe of fair value and recognize revenue when the fundamental revenue recognition criteria above are met 
for the remainder of the nexius customers  we currently do not have vsoe for the multiple deliverables and account for all elements in these arrangements as a single unit of accounting  recognizing the entire arrangement fee as revenue over the service period of the last delivered element 
during the period of performance  billings and costs to the extent they are recoverable are accumulated on the balance sheet  but no profit or income is recorded before user acceptance of the software license 
to the extent estimated costs are expected to exceed revenue we accrue for costs immediately 
business combinations we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
generally  restructuring costs incurred in periods subsequent to the acquisition date are expensed when incurred 
all subsequent changes to an income tax valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in income tax valuation allowances are recognized as a reduction or increase to income tax expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
acquired in process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life 
goodwill and intangible assets we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire other businesses 
the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill involves the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of the allocation process can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
we estimate the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired using several different valuation approaches  including 
table of contents relief from royalty method  and income and market approaches 
the relief from royalty method assumes that if we did not own the intangible asset or intellectual property  we would be willing to pay a royalty for its use 
we generally use the relief from royalty method for estimating the value of acquired technology methodology assets 
the income approach converts the anticipated economic benefits that we assume will be realized from a given asset into value 
under this approach  value is measured as the present worth of anticipated future net cash flows generated by an asset 
we generally use the income approach to value customer relationship assets and non compete agreements 
the market approach compares the acquired asset to similar assets that have been sold 
we generally use the income approach to value trademarks and brand assets 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized  but rather are periodically tested for impairment 
an impairment review generally requires developing assumptions and projections regarding our operating performance 
we have determined that all of our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit as we do not operate separate lines of business with respect to our services 
accordingly  on an annual basis we perform the impairment assessment for goodwill at the enterprise level by comparing the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill recorded by the reporting unit 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying value and any impairment determined is recorded in the current period 
if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of these assets  which could be material 
there were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended december   or long lived assets our long lived assets primarily consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying amount 
recoverability measurement and estimation of undiscounted cash flows are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset group s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis 
although we believe that the carrying values of our long lived assets are appropriately stated  changes in strategy or market conditions or significant technological developments could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
there were no impairment charges recognized during the years ended december   or allowance for doubtful accounts we manage credit risk on accounts receivable by performing credit evaluations of our customers for existing customers coming up for renewal as well as all prospective new customers  by reviewing our accounts and contracts and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts 
allowances are based on management s judgment  which considers historical experience and specific knowledge of accounts that may not be collectible 
we make provisions based on our historical bad debt experience  a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices and an assessment of general economic conditions 
if the financial condition of a customer deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
we estimate our tax liability through calculations we perform for the determination of our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
these 
table of contents differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets  we consider factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  if carryback is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
in evaluating projections of future taxable income  we consider our history of profitability  the competitive environment  the overall outlook for the online marketing industry and general economic conditions 
in addition  we consider the timeframe over which it would take to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration 
to the extent we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to adjust the carrying value of such assets 
as of december   we estimate our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are approximately million and million  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in for federal income tax purposes and in for state income tax purposes 
in addition  at december   we estimate our aggregate net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes related to our foreign subsidiaries is million  which begins to expire in as of december  and  we recorded valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
at december   the valuation allowance was related to the deferred tax assets primarily net operating loss carryforwards of the foreign subsidiaries that are either loss companies or are in their start up phases  including entities in mexico  singapore  spain  australia  netherlands and china and the deferred tax asset related to the us capital loss carryforwards 
at december   the valuation allowance was primarily related to the deferred tax assets of the foreign subsidiaries that are in their start up phases  including china  spain  singapore  and certain certifica and nedstat subsidiaries  and the deferred tax asset related to the value of our auction rate securities 
as of december   we concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our netherlands deferred tax assets will be realized and determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance of million against our netherlands deferred tax assets 
in making that determination  we considered the losses incurred in the netherlands during and in prior years and the uncertainty regarding the future profitability of the netherlands operations 
we also concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in certain other foreign jurisdictions would be realized and that an increase to the valuation allowance was necessary 
in making that determination  we considered the losses incurred in these foreign jurisdictions during  the current overall economic environment  and the uncertainty regarding the profitability of certain foreign operations 
as a result we recorded an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that a substantial portion of our uk deferred tax assets will be realized and determined that it was appropriate to release the entire valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of in making that determination  we considered the profitability of the uk entity achieved in and prior years  coupled with the timing of the reversal of taxable temporary differences and the forecasted profitability in future years 
we also concluded that it was not more likely than not that a substantial portion of our deferred tax assets in certain other foreign jurisdictions would be realized and that an increase to the valuation allowance was necessary 
in making that determination  we considered the losses incurred in these foreign jurisdictions during  the current overall economic environment  and the uncertainty regarding the profitability of certain foreign operations 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we recorded an increase in the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
the exercise of certain stock options and the vesting of certain restricted stock awards during the years ended december  and generated income tax deductions equal to the excess of the fair market value over the exercise price or grant date fair value  as applicable 
we will not recognize a deferred tax asset with 
table of contents respect to the excess of tax over book stock compensation deductions until the tax deductions actually reduce our current taxes payable 
as such  we have not recorded a deferred tax asset in the accompanying financial statements related to the additional net operating losses generated from the windfall tax deductions associated with the exercise of these stock options and the vesting of the restricted stock awards 
if and when we utilize these net operating losses to reduce income taxes payable  the tax benefit will be recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital 
as of december  and december   the cumulative amount of net operating losses relating to such option exercises and vesting events that have been included in the gross net operating loss carryforwards above is million and million respectively 
during the year ended december   we recognized windfall tax benefits of approximately million related to certain state tax jurisdictions  which were recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital 
during the years ended december  and  certain stock options were exercised and certain shares related to restricted stock awards vested at times when our stock price was substantially lower than the fair value of those shares at the time of grant 
as a result  the income tax deduction related to such shares is less than the expense previously recognized for book purposes 
such shortfalls reduce additional paid in capital to the extent relevant windfall tax benefits have been previously recognized 
as described above  we recognized a portion of the windfall tax benefits in and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital 
therefore  the impact of the shortfalls totaling million has not been included in income tax expense but has reduced additional paid in capital for the year ended december  as of december   we had not yet recognized windfall tax benefits because the tax benefits had not resulted in a reduction of current taxes payable 
therefore  the impact of the shortfalls totaling million was included in income tax expense for the year ended december  looking forward we cannot predict the stock compensation shortfall impact because of dependency upon future market price performance of our stock 
for uncertain tax positions  we use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefits determined on a cumulative probability basis  which are more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements 
as of december   and  we had unrecognized tax benefits of million  million and million  respectively  on a tax effected basis 
it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
as of december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits was million 
as of december   the amount of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits was million 
we or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
for income tax returns filed by us  we are no longer subject to us federal examinations by tax authorities for years before or state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before  although tax attribute carryforwards generated prior to these years may still be adjusted upon examination by tax authorities 
stock based compensation we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of market based stock options and restricted stock units is determined using a monte carlo simulation embedded in a lattice model 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of the fair value of stock option awards and restricted stock awards is based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the our common stock price  expected stock price volatility over the expected life of awards  and actual and projected exercise behavior 
additionally we estimate forfeitures for share based awards at the dates of grant based on historical experience  adjusted for future expectation 
the forfeiture estimate is revised as necessary if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates 

table of contents we issue restricted stock awards whose restrictions lapse upon either the passage of time service vesting  achieving performance targets  or some combination of these restrictions 
for those restricted stock awards with only service conditions  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the explicit service period 
for awards with both performance and service conditions  we start recognizing compensation cost over the remaining service period when it is probable the performance condition will be met 
stock awards that contain performance or market vesting conditions  are excluded from diluted earnings per share computations until the contingency is met as of the end of that reporting period 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense we record may differ significantly from what we have previously recorded 
at december   total estimated unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock based awards granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the actual amount of stock based compensation expense we record in any fiscal period will depend on a number of factors  including the number of shares subject to restricted stock and or stock options issued  the fair value of our common stock at the time of issuance and the expected volatility of our stock price over time 
in addition  changes to our incentive compensation plan that heavily favor stock based compensation are expected to cause stock based compensation expense to increase in absolute dollars 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future period  the compensation expense we record may differ significantly from what we have previously recorded
