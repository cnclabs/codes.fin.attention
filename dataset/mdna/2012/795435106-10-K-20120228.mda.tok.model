overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs and medical devices used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our approximately member specialty sales and marketing team primarily focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists  who are doctors who specialize in gastrointestinal disorders  hepatologists  who are doctors who specialize in liver disease  and colorectal surgeons  who are doctors who specialize in disorders of the colon and rectum  to sell our products 
our current products demonstrate our ability to execute this strategy

we generate revenue primarily by selling our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
these direct customers resell and distribute our products to and through pharmacies to patients who have had our products prescribed by doctors 
we currently market our products  and intend to market future products  if approved by the fda  to us gastroenterologists hepatologists  colorectal surgeons and other physicians through our own direct sales force 
in december  we established our own field sales force to market colazal in the united states 
as of december   this sales force had approximately sales representatives in the field marketing our approved products 
although the creation of an independent sales organization involved substantial costs  we believe that the financial returns from our direct product sales have been and will continue to be more favorable to us than those from the indirect sale of products through marketing partners 
we generally enter into distribution or licensing relationships outside the united states and in certain markets in the united states where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
as a result of our acquisition of oceana therapeutics  inc in december  we have approximately ten sales representatives based in europe who sell solesta and deflux in europe 
we also sell deflux through distributors in approximately countries outside the united states and europe 
as of december   our sales and marketing staff  including our sales representatives  consisted of approximately people 
because demand for our products originates with doctors  our sales force calls on high prescribing specialists  primarily gastroenterologists  hepatologists and colorectal surgeons and we monitor new and total prescriptions for our products as key performance indicators for our business 
prescriptions result in our products being used by patients  requiring our direct customers to purchase more products to replenish their inventory 
however  our revenue might fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to other factors  such as increased buying by wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase or because of the introduction of new products 
revenue could be less than anticipated in subsequent quarters as wholesalers increased inventory is consumed 

table of contents our primary product candidates currently under development and their status are as follows compound indication status rifaximin irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs supplemental new drug application  or snda  submitted june   complete response letter  or crl  received on march   fda meeting held on june   advisory committee held on november   currently in phase crofelemer hiv associated diarrhea new drug application  or nda  accepted for filing  received priority review notification  prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  action date june  balsalazide disodium tablet ulcerative colitis crl received april   submitted response to crl on august   approved february  budesonide foam ulcerative proctitis phase methylnaltrexone bromide si opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic non malignant pain  subcutaneous injection snda accepted for filing  pdufa action date april  methylnaltrexone bromide oral opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic non malignant pain  oral phase products xifaxan rifaximin tablets xifaxan is a gastrointestinal specific oral antibiotic 
the fda approved xifaxan mg in may for the treatment of patients years of age and older with travelers diarrhea caused by noninvasive strains of e coli 
according to the centers for disease control  each year between and of international travelers  an estimated million people  develop diarrhea  with approximately of the cases caused by bacteria 
approximately million people sought treatment in the united states for infectious diarrhea in and approximately million of those patients were prescribed a drug  according to sdi healthcare analytics 
xifaxan mg was approved by the fda in march for reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy  or he  recurrence in patients years of age or older 
according to the us department of health and human services healthcare utilization project  there are approximately  patients in the united states who suffer from episodic overt he 
we believe the advantages of xifaxan to treat these conditions are two fold site targeted antibiotic delivery  and improved tolerability compared to other treatments 
less than of the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream when it is taken orally 
in addition  the drug might also cause fewer side effects or discomforts such as nausea  headache or dizziness than observed with currently available  more highly absorbed antibiotics 
we believe xifaxan is also less likely to cause harmful interaction with other drugs a patient may be taking 
we believe xifaxan is unique because there is no other us approved oral antibiotic with its potential lack of systemic absorption and safety profile 
we launched xifaxan mg in the united states in july and xifaxan mg in may using our own direct sales force 
we are exploring potential additional indications  formulations  clinical trials and co promotion arrangements to capitalize on the potential for xifaxan  including our development program in irritable bowel syndrome 
based on this potential indication  we believe xifaxan can potentially compete in an annual us market in excess of approximately billion 
while the aggregate potential markets for xifaxan are large  we expect to capture only a portion of each market due to competition  market acceptance and other factors

both the and mg treatment arms demonstrated highly statistically significant improvements in rescue free bowel movement  or rfbm  within hours of administration over days of dosing when compared to placebo treatment 
in addition  the and mg treatment arms demonstrated highly statistically significant improvements in rfbm within hours of administration following the first dose when compared to placebo treatment 
statistically significant efficacy was also seen in both the and mg treatment groups for the two key secondary efficacy endpoints  including one assessing response responder non responder to study drug during weeks to where responder is defined as having or more rfbms per week  with an increase of at least one rfbm per week over baseline  for at least out of the first weeks

in stage  subjects received mg  mg or mg crofelemer or placebo 
based on stage results  an independent panel of experts chose a dose of mg crofelemer for stage stage allowed for additional subjects to be enrolled into the mg and placebo groups 
the mg dose performed very similarly to the mg maximum dose in regards to the primary endpoint 
due to the adaptive design of the trial  the trial prespecified a treatment difference at a p value target of 
the actual p value achieved in the study was 
in this trial  the overall safety profile of crofelemer was balanced across all groups  including treatment and placebo

table of contents government regulation regulation of drug compounds united states the research  testing  manufacture  marketing and distribution of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder  and other federal and state statutes and regulations  govern  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  storage  record keeping  labeling  promotion and marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject a company to administrative sanctions or judicially imposed sanctions such as civil penalties  criminal prosecution  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  and total or partial suspension of product marketing and or approvals 
in addition  non compliance may result in the fda s refusal to approve pending ndas or supplements to approved ndas or in the withdrawal of an nda 
any such sanction could result in adverse publicity  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions  and results of operation 
the steps ordinarily required before a new pharmaceutical product containing a new chemical entity may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals and formulation studies  the submission to the fda of a notice of claimed investigational exemption for a new drug  which must become effective before clinical testing may commence  adequate and well controlled clinical human trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of an nda to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product 
preclinical tests must be conducted in compliance with good laboratory practice regulations 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
a day waiting period after the filing of each ind is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
in addition  the fda may  at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  impose a clinical hold on proposed or ongoing clinical trials 
if the fda imposes a clinical hold  clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without fda authorization and then only under terms authorized by the fda 
in some instances  the ind application process can result in substantial delay and expense 
clinical trials to support ndas are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
in phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess metabolism  pharmacokinetics and pharmacological actions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  phase trials are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
there can be no assurance that phase i  phase ii or phase testing will be completed successfully within any specified time period  if at all  with respect to any of our products subject to such testing 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  generally an nda is submitted 
fda approval of the nda is required before marketing may begin in the united states 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
in such an event  the nda must be resubmitted with the additional information and  again  is subject to review before filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
the fda generally has months in which to review the nda and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission 
in the last few years  fda review times have lengthened 
the fda may refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
if the fda s evaluation of the nda submission or manufacturing facilities is not favorable  the fda may refuse to approve the nda or issue a not approvable letter  outlining the deficiencies in the submission and often requiring additional testing or information 
if fda evaluations of the nda and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an complete response letter  which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
when and if those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
furthermore  approval may entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies  and marketed products  manufacturers and manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
in addition  identification of certain side effects after a drug is on the market or the occurrence of manufacturing problems could cause subsequent withdrawal of approval  reformulation of the drug  additional preclinical testing or clinical trials and changes in labeling of the product 
under the orphan drug act  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a disease or condition that affects populations of fewer than  individuals in the united states or a disease whose incidence rates number more than  where the sponsor establishes that it does not realistically anticipate that its product sales will be sufficient to 
table of contents recover its costs 
the sponsor that obtains the first marketing approval for a designated orphan drug for a given rare disease is eligible to receive marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the orphan indication for a period of seven years 
rifaximin for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy and colazal for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in pediatric patients between to years of age have been granted orphan drug status 
regulation of drug compounds outside of the united states outside the united states  the ability to market a drug is contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from the appropriate regulatory authorities 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
currently  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although within the european union procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one european union member state 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
if and when necessary  we will choose the appropriate route of european regulatory filing to accomplish the most rapid regulatory approvals 
however  the chosen regulatory strategy might not secure regulatory approvals or approvals of our chosen product indications 
furthermore  we must obtain pricing approval in addition to regulatory approval prior to launching the product in the approving country 
failure to obtain pricing approval in a timely manner or approval of pricing which would support an adequate return on investment or generate a sufficient margin to justify the economic risk might delay or prohibit the commercial launch of the product in those countries 
regulation of medical devices united states the medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies  including the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies 
these agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development  testing  manufacturing  labeling  marketing and distribution of medical devices 
devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control  the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution 
all medical devices in the united states are subject to general controls  which include establishment registration by manufacturers  distributors  repackages and re labelers  medical device listing with fda of devices to be marketed  good manufacturing practices  labeling regulations  and reporting of adverse events identified by the user  manufacturer and or distributor 
there are three fda regulatory classifications of medical devices class i  class ii  and class iii 
the classifications are assigned by the risk the medical device presents to the patient and the level of regulatory control the fda determines is needed to legally market the device 
class i medical devices have the least amount of regulatory control 
class i devices are typically simple in design  manufacture and have a history of safe use 
examples of class i devices include tongue depressors  arm slings and hand held surgical instruments 
most class i devices are exempt from the premarket notification and may be exempt from compliance with the good manufacturing practices regulation 
class ii medical devices are devices where general controls are not sufficient to assure safety and effectiveness and existing methods standards guidance documents are available to provide assurances of safety and effectiveness 
in addition to compliance with general controls  class ii devices are required to comply with special controls  including special labeling requirements  mandatory performance standards  postmarket surveillance  and fda medical device specific guidance 
class ii devices typically require pre market notification by submission and fda review of a k clearance to market submission 
a few class ii devices are exempt from the premarket notification 
examples of class ii devices include physiologic monitors  x ray systems  gas analyzers  pumps and surgical drapes 

table of contents class iii medical devices have the most stringent regulatory controls 
for class iii medical devices  sufficient information is not available to assure safety and effectiveness through the application of general controls and special controls 
class iii devices usually support or sustain human life  are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health  or present a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury to the patient 
typically a pre market approval  or pma  submission to the fda is required to allow marketing of a class iii medical device 
in this case  two steps of fda approval are generally required before marketing in the us can begin 
first  we must comply with the applicable investigational device exemption regulations in connection with any human clinical investigation of the device in the us second  the fda must review our pma application  which contains  among other things  clinical information acquired under the ide 
the fda will approve the pma application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose 
examples of class iii devices that require a pma are replacement heart valves  silicone gel filled breast implants  and implanted brain lobe stimulators 
our current medical devices  solesta and deflux  are class iii devices and were approved under pmas 
the fda can ban certain medical devices  detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices  order repair  replacement or refund of these devices  and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health 
the fda may also enjoin and restrain certain violations of the food  drug and cosmetic act and the safe medical devices act pertaining to medical devices  or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations 
international sales of medical devices manufactured in the us that are not approved by the fda for use in the us  or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards  are subject to fda export requirements 
regulation of medical devices outside of the united states exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported 
some countries do not have medical device regulations  but in most foreign countries  medical devices are regulated 
frequently  regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the us to take advantage of differing regulatory requirements 
most countries outside of the us require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis  generally every five years 
the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance 
where recertification applications are required  they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries 
in the european union  we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives including the medical devices directive and the active implantable medical devices directive and obtain ce mark certification in order to market medical devices 
the ce mark certification  granted following approval from an independent notified body  is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical devices directives 
we are also required to comply with other foreign regulations such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare mhlw before we can launch new products in japan 
the time required to obtain these foreign approvals to market our products may vary from us approvals  and requirements for these approvals may differ from those required by the fda 
competition competition in our business is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts  rapid technological progress and an increasing rate of generic product approvals 
technological developments by competitors  earlier regulatory approval for marketing competitive products  including generic versions of our products  such as those launched against colazal in december  and pepcid in  or superior marketing capabilities possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
we believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including large well known pharmaceutical companies and generic manufacturers  as well as academic research groups throughout the world  engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at gastrointestinal diseases and conditions addressed by our current and potential products 
in particular  we are aware of products in research or development by competitors that address the diseases being targeted by our products 
developments by others might render our current and potential products obsolete or non competitive 
competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and  therefore  market their products earlier than us 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities than we do 
for example  lactulose  a drug that is used to treat hepatic encephalopathy and competes with xifaxan mg  is offered by various pharmaceutical manufacturers  including several generic manufacturers 
many large  well capitalized companies already offer products in the united states and europe that target the indications for balsalazide and our mesalamine extended release capsule product  including mesalamine glaxosmithkline plc  giuliani spa  axcan pharma  inc  abbott laboratories  warner chilcott plc and shire pharmaceuticals group plc  sulfasalazine pharmacia upjohn  inc  and olsalazine alaven pharmaceutical llc 
asacol  marketed by warner chilcott  is currently the most prescribed product for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in the united states  and shire introduced once a day lialda in in addition  on december   the office of generic drugs approved three generic balsalazide capsule products 

table of contents several prescription liquid peg products compete with visicol  osmoprep and moviprep in the bowel cleansing market 
these prescription products include colyte  golytely  halflytely  suprep and nulytely braintree and trilyte alaven pharmaceutical llc 
generic prescription  liquid peg products are also available 
the most frequently prescribed product for treatment of travelers diarrhea in the united states currently is ciprofloxacin  commonly known as cipro and marketed by bayer ag 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with azasan are imuran  marketed by prometheus laboratories  inc  and its various generics and purinethol  marketed by gate pharmaceuticals  and it s various generics 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with anusol hc and proctocort are anamantle hc  marketed by nycomed  analpram hc  marketed by ferndale laboratories  proctofoam hc and proctocream hc  marketed by alaven pharmaceutical llc  procto kit  marketed by ranbaxy pharmaceuticals  and various generics 
the most frequently prescribed products that compete with metozolv are reglan  marketed by alaven pharmaceuticals llc  and various generics 
relistor competes with several branded prescription and over the counter  or otc  products in the oic market in advanced illness palliative care 
the otc products are the most frequently prescribed first line for this condition  and include but are not limited to kondremul  a lubricant laxative  miralax  an osmotic laxative  fleets phosphosoda and milk of magnesia saline laxatives  dulcolax and senokot  stimulant laxatives  and colace  a stool softener 
prescription product competitors include  but are not limited to the following products amitiza  a chloride channel blocker marketed bytakeda pharmaceutical company limited  kristalose  an osmotic laxative marketed by cumberland pharmaceuticals  inc  and entereg  a mu opioid receptor antagonist marketed by cubist pharmaceuticals  inc fecal incontinence management is still an emerging market  with solesta being the most recent innovative treatment 
solesta competes in a market with a wide range of treatment approaches  including manipulating diet  otc therapies such as antidiarrheals  fiber  stool softeners and laxatives  biofeedback  sacral nerve stimulation using a device called inter stim marketed by medtronic  inc  and finally  sphincteroplasty surgery 
diet changes and otc medications followed by biofeedback are usually first used before more invasive approaches are taken 
employees as of december   we had approximately full time employees 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract  hire  and retain qualified personnel  including sales and marketing personnel in particular 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  attract  and retain such personnel in the future 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good

risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference 
if any of the following risks  or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant  develop into actual events  then our business  financial condition  results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected 
if that happens  the market price of our common stock could decline  and stockholders might lose all or part of their investment 
future sales of xifaxan and our other marketed products might be less than expected 
we currently actively market and sell seven primary products 
we expect xifaxan  which was launched in mid for the treatment of traveler s diarrhea  and approved and launched in march for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy  to be our most significant source of revenue in the future 
if sales of our marketed products decline or if we experience product returns significantly in excess of estimated amounts recorded  particularly with respect to xifaxan  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the degree of market acceptance of our products among physicians  patients  healthcare payors and the medical community will depend upon a number of factors including the timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors  and including any generic or over the counter competitors  perceptions by physicians and other members of the healthcare community regarding the safety and efficacy of the products  price increases  and the price of our products relative to other drugs or competing treatments  patient and physician demand  adverse side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or other drugs in our class  the results of product development efforts for new indications  the scope and timing of additional marketing approvals and favorable reimbursement programs for expanded uses  availability of sufficient commercial quantities of the products  and our success in getting other companies to distribute our products outside of the us gastroenterology market 
regulatory approval of our product candidates is time consuming  expensive and uncertain  and could result in unexpectedly high expenses and delay our ability to sell our products 
development of our products is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in early  the fda announced that because of its large workload it might not meet its target dates to respond to nda submissions  and since then we have experienced delays in fda review of metozolv  balsalazide tablets and rifaximin for he 
this regulation and workload could require us to incur significant unexpected expenses or delay or limit our ability to sell our product candidates  including specifically rifaximin for irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs 
in august  the fda accepted our nda for rifaximin for ibs  and gave us an action date of december  in october the fda informed us they were extending the action date by three months to provide for a full review and extended our action date to march  we received a complete response letter  or crl  on march  the fda issues a crl to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval 
the fda deems that the xifaxan mg snda is not ready for approval  primarily due to a newly expressed need for retreatment information 
we expect to initiate enrollment in a retreatment trial in the first quarter of  but there is no assurance that the fda will approve rifaximin for ibs in a timely manner  or at all 
our clinical studies might be delayed or halted  or additional studies might be required  for various reasons  including the drug is not effective  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  appropriate patients do not enroll in the studies at the rate expected  as was the case with our xifaxan phase trial in thailand for the prevention of travelers diarrhea  drug supplies are not sufficient to treat the patients in the studies  or we decide to modify the drug during testing 

table of contents if regulatory approval of any product is granted  it will be limited to those indications for which the product has been shown to be safe and effective  as demonstrated to the fda s satisfaction through clinical studies 
for example  rifaximin has been approved for treatment of travelers diarrhea and he  but we are developing rifaximin for ibs and other indications 
the fda might not ever approve any of our compounds in the indications we are pursuing  which would mean we cannot market these compounds for use in these indications 
regulatory approval  even if granted  might entail ongoing requirements or restrictions on marketing that could increase our expenses and limit revenue 
approval might entail ongoing requirements for post marketing studies  or limit how or to whom we can sell our products 
even if we obtain regulatory approval  labeling and promotional activities are subject to continual scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
for example  in the fda required us to put a black box warning on the osmoprep and visicol labels regarding potential kidney damage that could result from their use  and a black box warning for metozolv regarding tardive dyskensia which could result from its use 
these warnings could limit future sales of those products 
in addition  fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses  and we periodically receive inquiries from regulators  including specifically the office of prescription drug promotion of the fda  or opdp  formerly known as the division of drug marketing  advertising  and communications of the fda  or ddmac  regarding compliance with marketing and other regulations 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them might increase our expenses  impair our ability to effectively market our products  and limit our revenue 
our intellectual property rights might not afford us with meaningful protection 
the intellectual property rights protecting our products might not afford us with meaningful protection from generic and other competition 
in addition  because our strategy is to in license or acquire pharmaceutical products which typically have been discovered and initially researched by others  future products might have limited or no remaining patent protection due to the time elapsed since their discovery 
competitors could also design around any of our intellectual property or otherwise design competitive products that do not infringe our intellectual property 
any litigation in which we become involved to enforce intellectual property rights could result in substantial cost to us 
in addition  claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could be costly 
our patent or other proprietary rights related to our products might conflict with the current or future intellectual property rights of others 
litigation or patent interference proceedings  either of which could result in substantial cost to us  might be necessary to defend any patents to which we have rights and our other proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of other parties proprietary rights 
the defense of patent and intellectual property claims is both costly and time consuming  even if the outcome is favorable 
any adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties  or require us to cease selling one or more of our products 
we might not be able to obtain a license to any third party technology that we require to conduct our business  or  if obtainable  that technology might not be available at a reasonable cost 
upon patent expiration  our drugs could be subject to generic competition  which could negatively affect our pricing and sales volume 
as previously disclosed  this has already happened to colazal  which had been our largest selling drug prior to the patents for the rifaximin composition of matter also covering a process of making rifaximin and using rifaximin to treat gastrointestinal infectious diseases expired in may in the united states and canada

wright the general partnership that was the initial licensor of the patent to salix  a sublicense agreement with cdc  the general partnership and novel  a supply agreement with novel  and  a second amendment to supply agreement with cdc and the general partnership 
under the terms of the sublicense agreement  we  cdc and the general partnership have granted novel a fully paid up  non exclusive license under the osmoprep patents such that it is permitted to launch a generic osmoprep product on november  rifaximin is a new chemical entity and was granted five year new chemical entity exclusivity by the fda when it was approved in may rifaximin  therefore  had data exclusivity until may accordingly  the office of generic drugs would have been able to accept an anda for xifaxan tablets on or any time subsequent to may  if the applicant made certifications of patent non infringement or invalidity 
if this occurred  a paragraph iv notification would have to be provided to us by the applicant 
although we do not possess any specific knowledge of any such filing at the current time  the expiration of data exclusivity could result in a challenge to the related intellectual property rights of xifaxan mg tablets at any time in the future 
in may we submitted a citizen petition  requesting the director of the office of generic drugs of the food and drug administration impose scientifically appropriate standards for the demonstration of bioequivalence for abbreviated new drug applications citing xifaxan as the reference listed drug 
rifaximin mg  which is approved for the reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy he recurrence in patients years of age and older  was granted orphan exclusivity through march accordingly  the office of generic drugs  or ogd  would have been able to accept an anda for xifaxan mg tablets on or any time subsequent to march  if the applicant made certifications of patent non infringement or invalidity 
if this occurred  a paragraph iv notification would have to be provided to us by the applicant 
although we do not possess any specific knowledge of any such filing at the current time  the orphan exclusivity period does not prohibit the filing of an anda and thus  an anda filing could result in a challenge to the related intellectual property rights of xifaxan mg tablets at any time in the future 
the ogd would be unable to finally approve an anda until the expiration of the orphan exclusivity in march on november  the fda posted draft bioequivalence guidance for rifaximin mg tablets for the treatment of travelers diarrhea 
this guidance recommends conducting a randomized  double blind  parallel placebo controlled clinical trial in humans with clinical endpoints in order to file an anda for approval of a generic rifaximin mg tablet for the treatment of travelers diarrhea 
on november   we received a paragraph iv notification from novel laboratories  inc stating that novel had filed an anda application to seek approval to market a generic version of metoclopramide hydrochloride odt  mg and mg 
the notification letter asserted non infringement of us patent no 
 or the patent 
upon examination of the relevant sections of the anda  we concluded that the patent would not be enforced against novel laboratories 
on march  we received a paragraph iv notification from zydus pharmaceuticals stating that zydus had filed an anda application to seek approval to market a generic version of metoclopramide hydrochloride odt  mg and mg 
the notification letter asserted non infringement of the patent 
upon examination of the relevant sections of the anda  we concluded that the patent would not be enforced against zydus 
in february salix licensed exclusive worldwide except japan rights to relistor methylnaltrexone bromide 
the relistor subcutaneous injection product was granted five year regulatory new chemical entity exclusivity until april  the exclusivity prevents the fda from approving an anda until april   however  an anda may be filed after april  the relistor subcutaneous injection has patent protection to november there are other patents pending on the formulation  that if issued will provide protection to april patent application for an oral version of relistor  if issued  should provide protection to march in december  salix acquired licensed rights to solesta and deflux through the acquisition of oceana therapeutics  inc deflux and solesta are protected by us patent no 
 which is directed to composition and method claims and provides protection to may and us patent no 
 which is directed to methods of manufacturing and provides protection to july because azasan  anusol hc  pepcid and proctocort are mature products  there are no patents or data exclusivity rights available which subjects us to greater risk of generic competition for those products 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
these agreements might be breached and we might not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  our trade secrets and proprietary know how might otherwise become known or be independently developed by others 

table of contents intense competition might render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
competition in our business is intense and characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
technological developments by competitors  regulatory approval for marketing competitive products  including potential generic or over the counter products  or superior marketing resources possessed by competitors could adversely affect the commercial potential of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations 
generic competition is an increasing risk  as we have experienced with colazal and pepcid  and with challenges to our bowel cleansing products intellectual property noted above 
we believe that there are numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including large well known pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic research groups throughout the world  engaged in research and development efforts with respect to pharmaceutical products targeted at gastrointestinal diseases and conditions addressed by our current and potential products 
in particular  we are aware of products in research or development by competitors that address the diseases being targeted by our products 
developments by others might render our current and potential products obsolete or noncompetitive 
competitors might be able to complete the development and regulatory approval process sooner and  therefore  market their products earlier than we can 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and personnel resources and development capabilities than we do 
for example  many large  well capitalized companies already offer products in the united states and europe that target the indications for xifaxan for he  including lactulose various manufacturers  xifaxan for travelers diarrhea  including ciprofloxacin  commonly known as cipro bayer ag  visicol  osmoprep and moviprep  including colyte  golytely  halflytely  suprep  and nulytely braintree and trilyte alaven pharmaceutical llc  as well as potential generics from novel laboratories or others  apriso  including asacol warner chilcott  sulfasalazine pfizer  dipentum alaven pharmaceutical llc  pentasa shire pharmaceuticals group  plc  once a day lialda shire  and three generic balsalazide capsule products  relistor for oic  including otc laxatives various manufacturers  amitiza takeda  kristalose cumberland and entereg cubist  solesta  including various otc antidiarrheals  fiber  stool softeners and laxatives various manufacturers  biofeedback  the medical device inter stim medtronic and sphincteroplasty surgery  xifaxan under development  including lotronex prometheus and amitiza sucampo pharmaceuticals  inc for ibs  and metozolv odt  including reglan alaven pharmaceutical llc  and various generics 
in addition  other products are in research or development by competitors that address the diseases and diagnostic procedures being targeted by these and our other products 
we could be exposed to significant product liability claims that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
we have been in the past and might continue to be subjected to product liability claims that arise through the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products 
for example  we are currently and might continue to be subject to a number of product liability claims relating to osmoprep and visicol in connection with their box label warning 
we intend to defend these claims vigorously 
during the fourth quarter of we settled a number of the osmoprep and visicol lawsuits and were notified by our insurer that settlement of these claims exceeded the limits of the policies related to these claims 
as a result  we recorded a million reserve  which is our estimate of the costs of the remaining claims we are aware of 
however  the eventual settlement of these claims could exceed this estimate  and we could receive additional claims we are not currently aware of 
we currently maintain liability coverage for both clinical trials and the commercialization of our products but it is possible that this coverage  and any future coverage  will be insufficient to satisfy any liabilities that arise 
we would have to assume defense of the lawsuits and be responsible for damages  fees and expenses  if any  that are awarded against us or for amounts in excess of our product liability coverage 
these claims could expose us to significant liabilities that could prevent or interfere with our product commercialization efforts 
product liability claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
in the future  we might not be able to obtain adequate coverage at an acceptable cost or might be unable to obtain adequate coverage at all 

table of contents if government and other third party payors do not provide coverage or reimburse patients for our products  our ability to derive revenues might suffer 
our success will depend in part on the extent to which government and health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors will pay for our products 
reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products is uncertain 
we acquired our first medical devices in december  one of which was launched in  and we are navigating the complex medical device reimbursement system 
in the united states and elsewhere  third party payors  such as medicaid  are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new therapeutic products 
in the united states  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the healthcare system have been passed in recent years  including the patient protection and affordable care act 
many significant changes in this legislation do not take effect until  and various legal challenges and ongoing political opposition create uncertainty as to the final form of this legislation 
these changes to the healthcare system could increase our costs and reduce the amount we can charge for our drugs 
in addition  an increasing emphasis on managed care in the united states has and will continue to increase pressure on pharmaceutical pricing 
while we cannot predict whether legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted or what effect those proposals or managed care efforts  including those relating to medicaid payments  might have on our business  the announcement and or adoption of such proposals or efforts could increase costs and reduce or eliminate profit margins  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
third party insurance coverage might not be available to patients for our products 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  the market acceptance of these products might be reduced 
our ability to increase revenue in the future will depend in part on our success in in licensing or acquiring additional pharmaceutical products or medical devices 
we currently intend to in license or acquire additional pharmaceutical products or medical devices  as we did with crofelemer and budesonide  that have been developed beyond the initial discovery phase and for which late stage human clinical data is already available  or as we did with relistor  deflux and solesta  that has already received regulatory approval 
these kinds of pharmaceutical products and medical devices might not be available to us on attractive terms or at all 
to the extent we acquire rights to additional products  we might incur significant additional expense in connection with the development and  if approved by the fda  marketing of these products 
we are dependent on third parties to supply us with products 
we rely entirely on third parties to supply us with our commercially marketed products and our products under development 
for example  glenmark pharmaceuticals  ltd  a corporation organized and located in india  manufactures and supplies us with drug substance for crofelemer  an anti secretory agent that we are developing for the treatment of hiv associated diarrhea 
the raw material used in production of the crofelemer drug substance grows in select countries in south america 
the amount of resources glenmark devotes to these activities and its ability to successfully obtain raw material is not within our control 
failure by glenmark to manufacture and supply us with crofelemer drug substance  whether due to international  political or economic conditions or otherwise  could delay development  increase expenses  delay regulatory approval  or eventually prevent us from generating revenue from crofelemer  if approved  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a key raw material for relistor grows in tasmania 
our inability to obtain this raw material  whether due to international  political or economic conditions or otherwise  could delay development  increase expenses  delay regulatory approval  or eventually prevent us from generating revenue from additional indications for relistor  if approved  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
likewise  interruption of supply of any of our other products  whether for clinical use or commercial use  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products 
we own no manufacturing facilities  and we have limited capabilities in manufacturing pharmaceutical products 
we do not generally expect to engage directly in the manufacturing of products  but instead contract with and rely on third party vendors for these services 
a limited number of contract manufacturers exist which are capable of manufacturing our marketed products and our product candidates 
we might fail to contract with the necessary manufacturers or might contract with manufacturers on terms that may not be entirely acceptable to us 
for example  in april we received a complete response letter from the fda on our nda for balsalazide tablets 
the sole issue raised in this letter concerned a deficiency of the manufacturing facility for this application  which delayed fda approval almost two years 
given our ongoing dependence on third party vendors for supply of material for use in clinical trials and for commercial product  our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks the manufacture of products might be difficult to scale up when required and result in delays  inefficiencies and poor or low yields of quality products  
table of contents some of our contracts contain purchase commitments that require us to make minimum purchases that might exceed our needs or limit our ability to negotiate with other manufacturers  which might increase costs  the cost of manufacturing certain products might make them prohibitively expensive  delays in scale up to commercial quantities and any change in manufacturers could delay clinical studies  regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products  manufacturers are subject to the fda s current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations and similar foreign standards  and we do not have control over compliance with these regulations by the third party manufacturers  if we need to change manufacturers  transfers of technical expertise would be required which would include educating the new manufacturer in the processes necessary for the production of our products  which may not be successful  and if we need to change manufacturers  fda and comparable foreign regulators may require additional testing and compliance inspections prior to the new manufacturer being qualified for the production of our products 
failure to comply with manufacturing regulation could harm us financially and could hurt our reputation 
we and our third party manufacturers  such as glenmark pharmaceuticals  ltd 
that produces crofelemer drug substance  are also required to comply with the applicable cgmp regulations which include requirements relating to manufacturing  packaging  documentation  quality control  and quality assurance 
further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our products 
for example  in april we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding our nda for our balsalazide tablet 
in the complete response letter there were no requests for new pre clinical or clinical trials 
the sole issue raised in this letter concerned a deficiency of the manufacturing facility for this application 
the manufacturer has responded to the fda and continues to work with the fda to resolve the matter  however the manufacturer has not resolved these issues and we have been unable to receive approval or launch our balsalazide tablet 
such facilities are subject to periodic fda inspection 
manufacturing regulations can increase our expenses and delay production  either of which could reduce our margins 
in addition  if we fail to comply with any of fda s continuing regulations  we could be subject to reputational harm and sanctions  including delays  warning letters and fines  product recalls or seizures and injunctions on sales  refusal of the fda to review pending applications  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
in addition  the occurrence of manufacturing related compliance issues could cause subsequent withdrawal of the drug approval  reformulation of the drug product  additional testing or changes in labeling of the finished product 
because our business and industry are highly regulated and scrutinized  and subject to litigation risks  our long term strategy and success is dependent upon compliance with applicable regulations and maintaining our business integrity 
our business and industry are highly regulated and scrutinized  and subject to litigation risks  including product liability risks described above and other risks 
we are subject to extensive and complex laws and regulation  including but not limited to  health care fraud and abuse laws  such as the federal false claims act  the federal anti kickback statute  and other state and federal laws and regulations 
while we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to promote compliance with applicable us laws and regulations  we cannot guarantee that this program will protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure or alleged failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations 
there appears to be a heightened risk of such investigations in the current environment  as evidenced by recent enforcement activity and pronouncements by the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services that it intends to continue to vigorously pursue fraud and abuse violations by pharmaceutical companies  including through the use of a legal doctrine that could impose criminal penalties on pharmaceutical company executives 
if any such actions are instituted against us  and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights  those actions could have a significant impact on our business  including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 
our research  development and manufacturing efforts  and those of third parties that research  develop and manufacture our products and product candidates on our behalf or in collaboration with us  involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals  viruses  bacteria and various radioactive compounds  and are therefore subject to numerous us and international environmental and safety laws and regulations and to periodic inspections for possible violations of these laws and regulations 
in 
table of contents addition  we  and our collaborators and third party manufacturers may also become subject to laws and regulations related to climate change  including the impact of global warming 
the costs of compliance with environmental and safety laws and regulations are significant  and the costs of complying with climate change laws could also be significant 
any violations  even if inadvertent or accidental  of current or future environmental  safety or climate change laws or regulations could subject us to substantial fines  penalties or environmental remediation costs  or cause us to lose permits or other authorizations to operate affected facilities  any of which could adversely affect our operations 
the laws and regulations applicable to our relationships with our employees and contractors are complex  extensive and fluid  and are subject to evolving interpretations by regulatory and judicial authorities 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in significant damages  orders and or fines and therefore could adversely affect our operations 
for example  a decision by the us court of appeals for the second circuit  in re novartis wage hour litigation  in a split from an earlier decision from the us court of appeals for the third circuit  held that pharmaceutical sales representatives were non exempt employees under the fair labor standards act 
the second circuit s decision might trigger additional litigation against pharmaceutical companies  including us 
an adverse result in any such litigation could result in significant damages to us and could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  through the purchase or license of products and purchase of companies 
our integration of the operations of acquired products and businesses  including oceana  which we acquired in december and which includes foreign employees and operations  requires significant efforts  including the coordination of information technologies  research and development  sales and marketing  operations  manufacturing and finance 
these efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management s time 
factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include the strength of the acquired companies or products underlying technology and ability to execute  results of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures  our ability to adequately fund acquired in process research and development projects and retain key employees  and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies and products  such as increasing sales of our products  achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products 
our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of these acquisitions could have an adverse impact on our business 
in addition  we cannot be certain that the businesses or products we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful  we may record related asset impairment charges in the future 
our results of operations might fluctuate from period to period  and a failure to meet the expectations of investors or the financial community at large could result in a decline in our stock price 
as they have in the past  our results of operations might fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis due to  among other factors the timing of regulatory approvals and product launches by us or competitors  including potential generic or over the counter competitors  the level of revenue generated by commercialized products  including potential increased purchases of inventory by wholesalers in anticipation of potential price increases or introductions of new dosages or bottle sizes  and subsequent lower than expected revenue as the inventory is used  the timing of any up front payments that might be required in connection with any future acquisition of product rights  the timing of milestone payments that might be required to our current or future licensors  fluctuations in our development and other costs in connection with ongoing product development programs  the level of marketing and other expenses required in connection with product launches and ongoing product growth  the timing of the acquisition and integration of businesses  assets  products and technologies  and general and industry specific business and economic conditions 

table of contents we expect to be profitable and have positive cash flow during  but we might need additional capital 
we expect to be profitable and have positive cash flow during  and believe that our current cash and cash equivalents together with cash generated from the sale of our products will be sufficient to fund our operations for and beyond  but that might not be the case 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to our business development activities  including potential acquisition of products or companies  or entry into additional collaborative arrangements  the results  costs and timing of our research and development activities  regulatory approvals and product launches  the status of competitive products  including current and potential generics  the cost and number of products we acquire or in license  any impact on us of current conditions and uncertainties in the economy generally and the financial markets  patient and physician demand for our products  and our ability to reduce our costs in the event product demand is less than expected  or regulatory approvals are delayed or more expensive than expected 
if we need additional capital  we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or acquisitions 
if we incur more debt  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
if we issued additional equity  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we might also enter into additional collaborative arrangements that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone and or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all  especially in the current economic environment 
our common stock is likely to decrease in value if the market believes that we will be required to raise additional capital 
our stock price is volatile 
our stock price has been extremely volatile and might continue to be  making owning our stock risky 
between january  and february   the price of a share of our common stock varied from a low of to a high of 
in  there were days on which our stock price increased or decreased by or more 
the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the performance of particular companies  including as a result of the current credit and economic crisis 
in addition  the market prices of the common stock of many publicly traded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have in the past been and can in the future be expected to be especially volatile 
announcements of prescription trends  technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  generic approvals  developments or disputes concerning proprietary rights  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us or our competitors  regulatory developments in both the united states and other countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products  and economic and other external factors  as well as period to period fluctuations in financial results  might have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock 
antitakeover provisions could discourage a takeover that stockholders consider to be in their best interests or prevent the removal of our current directors and management 
we have adopted a number of provisions that could have antitakeover effects or prevent the removal of our current directors and management 
we have adopted a stockholder protection rights plan  commonly referred to as a poison pill 
the rights plan is intended to deter an attempt to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
the rights plan will not prevent an acquisition that is approved by our board of directors 
we believe our rights plan assisted in our successful defense against a hostile takeover bid earlier in our charter authorizes our board of directors to determine the terms of up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and issue them without stockholder approval 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from acquiring  voting control in order to remove our current directors and management 
our bylaws also eliminate the ability of the stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting or make proposals at stockholder meetings without giving us advance written notice  which could hinder the ability of stockholders to quickly take action that might be opposed by management 
these provisions could make more difficult the removal of current directors and management or a takeover of salix  even if these events could be beneficial to stockholders 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock

on or about july   strides arcolab limited filed a suitability petition with the fda seeking permission to submit an anda for change of dosage form from tablet to capsule as suitable for a mg generic version of xifaxan 
we intend to vigorously enforce the regulatory and intellectual property rights regarding xifaxan 
we are unable to predict the outcome of any ensuing regulatory action or litigation at the present time 
on november  the fda posted draft bioequivalence guidance for rifaximin mg tablets for the treatment of travelers diarrhea 
this guidance recommends conducting a randomized  double blind  parallel placebo controlled clinical trial in humans with clinical endpoints in order to file an anda for approval of a generic rifaximin mg tablet for the treatment of travelers diarrhea 
we believe that the draft bioequivalence guidance when made final will supersede this petition or will be an additional requirement to be met for any dosage form of a generic version of rifaximin mg 
we are currently and might continue to be subject to product liability claims that arise through the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of our products  including a number of claims relating to osmoprep  visicol and metozolv odt in connection with their respective box label warning 
we are vigorously defending these claims and intend to continue to do so but are currently unable to predict the outcome or to reasonably estimate the range of total potential expenses or losses  if any

on may   napo pharmaceuticals  inc filed a lawsuit against us in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york  alleging that we had engaged in fraudulent conduct  breached our collaboration agreement with napo dated december   and breached our duty of good faith and fair dealing 
napo also sought a declaratory judgment that napo had the right to terminate the collaboration agreement and sought unspecified damages in excess of million 
on or about december   napo filed an amended complaint seeking an unspecified amount of damages for alleged breaches of the collaboration agreement by the company and replacing napo s original complaint 
napo s amended complaint no longer seeks a declaratory judgment that napo has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement and removed the need for the court to rule on the company s motion to dismiss the original complaint 
we believe that napo s allegations continue to be without merit and their lawsuit baseless 
we filed an answer and counterclaim to the amended complaint on or about january   and intend to continue to vigorously defend against the lawsuit 
napo filed a reply to our counterclaim on or about february  we are moving forward with our development plan for crofelemer in accordance with the existing collaboration agreement

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring  developing and commercializing prescription drugs and medical devices used in the treatment of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders  which are those affecting the digestive tract 
our strategy is to identify and acquire rights to products that we believe have potential for near term regulatory approval or are already approved  apply our regulatory  product development  and sales and marketing expertise to commercialize these products  and use our approximately member specialty sales and marketing team primarily focused on high prescribing us gastroenterologists  who are doctors who specialize in gastrointestinal disorders  hepatologists  who are doctors who specialize in liver disease  and colorectal surgeons  who are doctors who specialize in disorders of the colon and rectum  to sell our products 
our current products demonstrate our ability to execute this strategy 
as of december   our products were xifaxan rifaximin tablets mg  indicated for travelers diarrhea  xifaxan rifaximin tablets mg  indicated for overt hepatic encephalopathy  which we began selling in the second quarter of  moviprep peg  sodium sulfate  sodium chloride  potassium chloride  sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid for oral solution  indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults years of age or older  relistor methylnaltrexone bromide subcutaneous injection si indicated for the treatment of opioid induced constipation oic in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative care  when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient  which we began promoting in the second quarter of  osmoprep sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults years of age or older  visicol sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate  usp  and sodium phosphate dibasic anhydrous  usp tablets  indicated for cleansing of the colon as a preparation for colonoscopy in adults years of age or older  apriso mesalamine delayed and extended release capsules g  indicated for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis  solesta  a biocompatible tissue bulking agent indicated for the treatment of fecal incontinence  which we acquired in december  deflux  a biocompatible tissue bulking agent indicated for the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux vur  which we acquired in december metozolv odt metoclopramide hcl mg and mg orally disintegrating tablets  indicated for short term to weeks use in adults for treatment of symptomatic  documented gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd that fails to respond to conventional therapy refractory gerd and relief of symptoms of acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis  azasan azathioprine tablets  usp  mg and mg  indicated as an adjunct for the prevention of rejection in renal homotransplantations and to reduce signs and symptoms of severe active rheumatoid arthritis  anusol hc hydrocortisone cream  usp  anusol hc mg suppository hydrocortisone acetate  indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses  proctocort cream hydrocortisone cream  usp and proctocort suppository hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories mg  indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses  pepcid famotidine for oral suspension  indicated for the short term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd  active duodenal ulcer  active benign gastric ulcer  erosive esophagitis due to gerd  and peptic ulcer disease  oral suspension diuril chlorothiazide  indicated for the treatment of hypertension and also as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure  cirrhosis of the liver  corticosteroid and estrogen therapy  and kidney disease  and colazal balsalazide disodium capsules mg  indicated for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis uc in patients years of age and older 

table of contents we generate revenue primarily by selling our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers 
these direct customers resell and distribute our products to and through pharmacies to patients who have had our products prescribed by doctors 
we currently market our products  and intend to market future products  if approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  to us gastroenterologists hepatologists  colorectal surgeons and other physicians through our own direct sales force 
in december  we established our own field sales force to market colazal in the united states 
as of december   this sales force had approximately sales representatives in the field marketing our approved products 
although the creation of an independent sales organization involved substantial costs  we believe that the financial returns from our direct product sales have been and will continue to be more favorable to us than those from the indirect sale of products through marketing partners 
we generally enter into distribution or licensing relationships outside the united states and in certain markets in the us where a larger sales organization is appropriate 
as a result of our acquisition of oceana therapeutics  inc in december  we have approximately ten sales representatives based in europe who sell solesta and deflux in europe 
we also sell deflux through distributors in approximately countries outside the united states and europe 
as of december   our sales and marketing staff  including our sales representatives  consisted of approximately people 
because demand for our products originates with doctors  our sales force calls on high prescribing specialists  primarily gastroenterologists  hepatologists and colorectal surgeons and we monitor new and total prescriptions for our products as key performance indicators for our business 
prescriptions result in our products being used by patients  requiring our direct customers to purchase more products to replenish their inventory 
however  our revenue might fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to other factors  such as increased buying by wholesalers in anticipation of a price increase or because of the introduction of new products 
revenue could be less than anticipated in subsequent quarters as wholesalers increased inventory is consumed 
our primary product candidates currently under development and their status are as follows compound indication status rifaximin irritable bowel syndrome  or ibs supplemental new drug application  or snda  submitted june   complete response letter  or crl  received on march   fda meeting held on june   advisory committee held on november   currently in phase crofelemer hiv associated diarrhea nda accepted for filing  received priority review notification  pdufa action date june  balsalazide disodium tablet ulcerative colitis crl received april   submitted response to crl on august   approved february  budesonide foam ulcerative proctitis phase methylnaltrexone bromide si opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic non malignant pain  subcutaneous injection snda accepted for filing  pdufa action date april  methylnaltrexone bromide oral opioid induced constipation in patients with chronic non malignant pain  oral phase critical accounting policies general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales of our products  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets and legal issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results might differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents methodologies used and assumptions selected by management in making these estimates  as well as the related disclosures  have been reviewed by and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales transactions where the buyer has the right to return the product at the time of sale only if our price to the buyer is substantially fixed or determinable at the date of sale  the buyer has paid us  or the buyer is obligated to pay us and the obligation is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer s obligation to us would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product  the buyer acquiring the product for resale has economic substance apart from any provided by us  we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the buyer  and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
we recognize revenues for product sales at the time title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer  which is generally at the time products are shipped 
our net product revenue represents our total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  and product returns 
we establish allowances for estimated rebates  chargebacks and product returns based on numerous quantitative and qualitative factors  including the number of and specific contractual terms of agreements with customers  estimated levels of inventory in the distribution channel  historical rebates  chargebacks and returns of products  direct communication with customers  anticipated introduction of competitive products or generics  anticipated pricing strategy changes by us and or our competitors  analysis of prescription data gathered by a third party prescription data provider  the impact of changes in state and federal regulations  and estimated remaining shelf life of products 
in our analyses  we use prescription data purchased from a third party data provider to develop estimates of historical inventory channel pull through 
we utilize an internal analysis to compare historical net product shipments to estimated historical prescriptions written 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel that might be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
at least quarterly for each product line  we prepare an internal estimate of ending inventory units in the distribution channel by adding estimated inventory in the channel at the beginning of the period  plus net product shipments for the period  less estimated prescriptions written for the period 
based on that analysis  we develop an estimate of the quantity of product in the channel that might be subject to various rebate  chargeback and product return exposures 
this is done for each product line by applying a rate of historical activity for rebates  chargebacks and product returns  adjusted for relevant quantitative and qualitative factors discussed above  to the potential exposed product estimated to be in the distribution channel 
internal forecasts that are utilized to calculate the estimated number of months in the channel are regularly adjusted based on input from members of our sales  marketing and operations groups 
the adjusted forecasts take into account numerous factors including  but not limited to  new product introductions  direct communication with customers and potential product expiry issues 
adjustments to estimates are recorded in the period when significant events or changes in trends are identified 
consistent with industry practice  we periodically offer promotional discounts to our existing customers 
these discounts are calculated as a percentage of the current published list price and are treated as off invoice allowances 
accordingly  we record the discounts as a reduction of revenue in the period that we offer the program 
in addition to promotional discounts  at the time that we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customers an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue upon shipment and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure would be specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 
allowances for estimated rebates and chargebacks were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these balances exclude amounts related to colazal  which are included in the reserve discussed below 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for items such as rebates due to various governmental organizations under the medicare medicaid regulations  rebates due to managed care organizations under specific contracts and chargebacks due to various organizations purchasing certain of our products through federal contracts and or group purchasing agreements 
we estimate our liability for rebates and chargebacks at each reporting period based on a methodology of applying the relevant quantitative and qualitative assumptions discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for rebates and chargebacks  we prepare various sensitivity analyses to ensure our final estimate is within a reasonable range as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology is still 
table of contents reasonable 
had a change in one or more variables in the analyses utilization rates  contract modifications  etc 
resulted in an additional percentage point change in the trailing average of estimated chargeback and rebate activity for the year ended december   we would have recorded an adjustment to revenues of approximately million  or  for the year 
allowances for product returns were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these allowances reflect an estimate of our liability for product that may be returned by the original purchaser in accordance with our stated return policy 
we estimate our liability for product returns at each reporting period based on historical return rates  the estimated inventory in the channel  and the other factors discussed above 
due to the subjectivity of our accrual estimates for product returns  we prepare various sensitivity analyses as well as review prior period activity to ensure that our methodology is still reasonable 
colazal  our balsalazide disodium capsule  accounted for a majority of the company s revenue prior to on december   the office of generic drugs  or ogd  approved three generic balsalazide capsule products 
as a result of these generic approvals  sales of this product significantly decreased in  and and we expect the future sales of colazal to be insignificant 
at december  and  respectively  million and million were recorded as a liability to reflect the company s estimate of the company s liability for colazal that may be returned or charged back by the original purchaser in accordance with the company s stated policies as a result of these generic approvals 
we developed this estimate based on the following our estimate of the quantity and expiration dates of colazal inventory in the distribution channel based on historical net product shipments less estimated historical prescriptions written  our estimate of future demand for colazal based on the actual erosion of product demand for several comparable products that were previously genericized  and the most recent demand for colazal prior to the generic approvals  the actual demand for colazal experienced during   and subsequent to the generic approvals  our estimate of chargeback and rebate activity based on price erosion as a result of the generic approvals  and other relevant factors 
during we adjusted our estimate of colazal returns based on our review of current trends for returns  chargebacks and purchases of colazal  and recorded approximately million as an increase to the reserve and a reduction of revenue during the period 
for the years ended december   and  our absolute exposure for rebates  chargebacks and product returns grew primarily as a result of increased sales of our existing products  the approval of new products and the acquisition of products  and also as a result of the approval of generic balsalazide capsule products 
accordingly  reductions to revenue and corresponding increases to allowance accounts have likewise increased 
the estimated exposure to these revenue reducing items as a percentage of gross product revenue in the years ended december   and was  and for rebates  chargebacks and discounts and was  and for product returns excluding the colazal return reserve  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of we shipped metozolv to wholesalers and began promoting this drug to physicians 
because we have limited experience with metozolv s indication we do not currently have the ability to estimate returns for metozolv 
we will recognize revenue for metozolv based upon prescription pull through until we have enough historical information to estimate returns 
during the second quarter of we recognized product revenue related to initial shipments to wholesalers of xifaxan mg  which the fda approved on march  for reduction in risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy  or he  recurrence in patients years of age or older  and we launched to physicians in may based on our historical experience with xifaxan mg  which we distribute through the same distribution channels and is prescribed by the same physicians as xifaxan mg  we have the ability to estimate returns for xifaxan mg  and therefore we recognize revenue upon shipment to the wholesalers 
during the second quarter of  we recognized product revenue related to shipments to wholesalers of relistor  which we acquired from progenics in february based on historical experience with relistor obtained from progenics  and historical experience with our products  specifically xifaxan mg  xifaxan mg and apriso  which we distribute through the same distribution channels and are prescribed by the same physicians as relistor  management has the ability to estimate returns for relistor  and therefore we recognize revenue upon shipment to the wholesalers 
in december we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to solesta and deflux with the completion of our acquisition of oceana 
solesta and deflux are medical devices that we sell to specialty distributors who then sell the products to end users  primarily hospitals  surgical centers and physicians 
the specialty distributors generally do not purchase these products until an end user is identified 
based on historical experience with these products obtained from oceana  and historical experience with our products  specifically xifaxan mg  xifaxan mg and apriso  which are prescribed by the same physicians as solesta  management has the ability to estimate returns for solesta and deflux  and therefore we recognize revenue upon shipment to the specialty distributors 

table of contents the enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of in march brings significant changes to us health care 
these changes began to take effect in the first quarter of changes to the rebates for prescription drugs sold to medicaid beneficiaries  which increase the minimum statutory rebate for branded drugs from percent to percent  were generally effective in the first quarter of this rebate has been expanded to managed medicaid  a program that provides for the delivery of medicaid benefits via managed care organizations  under arrangements between those organizations and state medicaid agencies 
additionally  a prescription drug discount program for outpatient drugs in health care facilities that serve low income and uninsured patients  known as b facilities  has been expanded 
the effect of these changes was not material to our or financial results 
based on our current product and payor mix  we believe the effect of these changes should not be material to our future financial results 
also  there are changes to the tax treatment of subsidies paid by the government to employers who provide their retirees with a drug benefit at least equivalent to the medicare part d drug benefit 
beginning in  the federal government will tax the subsidy it provides to such employers 
we do not provide retirees with any drug benefits  therefore this change should not affect our financial results 
beginning in  drug manufacturers will provide a discount of percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for medicare part d participants who are in the doughnut hole coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage 
the doughnut hole will be phased out by the federal government between and based on our current product and payor mix  the cost of this discount was less than of our gross revenue for the year ended december   however  the cost of this discount might have a material effect on our results of operations in future periods 
beginning in  pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs will have to pay a non tax deductible annual fee to the federal government 
companies will have to pay an amount based on their prior calendar year market share for branded prescription drug sales into these government programs 
based on our current product and payor mix  the effect of this tax was not material to our financial results in and we do not believe the effect of this tax will be material to future periods 
additionally  the healthcare reform legislation imposes a percent excise tax on us sales of class i  ii and iii medical devices beginning in this tax had no effect on our financial statements for  however  in light of the acquisition of our first medical devices  solesta and deflux  in december  the cost of this tax might have a material effect on our results of operations in future periods 
inventories we state raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories at the lower of cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out cost method or market value 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand and in the distribution channel  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including levels of competition  including generic competition 
inventory adjustments are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and charged to the provision for inventory  which is a component of cost of sales 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and any subsequent improvements in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we expense pre approval inventory unless we believe it is probable that the inventory will be saleable 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
capitalization of this inventory does not begin until the product candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval  which is generally after we have analyzed phase data or filed an new drug application  or nda 
if we are aware of any specific risks or contingencies that are likely to impact the expected regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety  efficacy  manufacturing  marketing or labeling of the product candidate  we do not capitalize the related inventory 
once we capitalize inventory for a product candidate that is not yet approved  we monitor  on a quarterly basis  the status of this candidate within the regulatory approval process 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in our judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in the timeline for commercialization or other potential factors 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate all inventory  including inventory capitalized for which regulatory approval has not yet been obtained  to determine if any lower of cost or market adjustment is required 
as it relates to pre approval inventory  we consider several factors including expected timing of fda approval  projected sales volume and estimated selling price 
at december  and  there were no amounts included in inventory related to pre approval inventory 
inventory at december  consisted of million of raw materials  million of work in process and million of finished goods 
inventory at december  consisted of million of raw materials  million of work in process and million of finished goods 
on november   we received a paragraph 
table of contents iv notification from novel stating that novel had filed an anda application to seek approval to market a generic version of metoclopramide hydrochloride odt  mg and mg 
the notification letter asserted non infringement of us patent no 
 the patent 
upon examination of the relevant sections of the anda  we concluded that the patent would not be enforced against novel 
as a result of this event  we evaluated the net realizable value of metozolv inventory and recorded a million reduction to the value of metozolv inventory 
intangible assets and goodwill our intangible assets consist of license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  which result from product and business acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
when we make product acquisitions that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets  we record the purchase price of such intangibles  along with the value of the product related liabilities that we assume  as intangible assets 
we allocate the aggregate purchase price to the fair value of the various tangible and intangible assets in order to determine the appropriate carrying value of the acquired assets and then amortize the cost of the intangible assets as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
we believe the following factors could trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  approval of generic products  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets  we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in november  we acquired from aaipharma llc for million the exclusive right to sell  and milligram dosage strengths of azathioprine tablets in north america under the name azasan 
the purchase price was fully allocated to product rights and related intangibles and is being amortized over a period of ten years 
although azasan does not have any patent protection  we believe ten years is an appropriate amortization period based on established product history and management s experience 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the azasan intangible was million and million  respectively 
in june  we acquired the exclusive us rights to anusol hc hydrocortisone cream usp  anusol hc mg suppository hydrocortisone acetate  proctocort cream hydrocortisone cream usp and proctocort suppositories hydrocortisone acetate rectal suppositories  mg from king pharmaceuticals  inc for million

in september  we acquired inkine pharmaceutical company  inc for million 
we allocated million of the purchase price to in process research and development  million to net assets acquired and million to specifically identifiable product rights and related intangibles with an ongoing economic benefit to us 
we allocated the remaining million to goodwill  which is not being amortized 
the inkine product rights and related intangibles are being amortized over an average period of years  which we believed was an appropriate amortization period due to the product s patent protection and the estimated economic lives of the product rights and related intangibles 
in september we entered into a sublicense agreement which granted novel laboratories  inc a license under the patents covering osmoprep permitting novel to launch a generic osmoprep on november  as a result of this agreement  we adjusted the amortization period prospectively  and we are amortizing the remaining net book value of the intangible asset through november   which is our revised estimate of its remaining economic life 
as a result of this agreement  we assessed whether there was an impairment to the carrying value of the related intangible asset due to its reduced economic life and determined that there was no impairment 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the inkine intangibles was million and million  respectively 
there is no future research or development planned for the products purchased from inkine 
in december  we entered into a license and supply agreement with norgine bv  granting salix the exclusive right to sell a patented protected  liquid peg bowel cleansing product  nrl  in the united states 
in august  we received fda marketing approval for nrl under the branded name of moviprep 
in january the uspto issued a patent providing 
table of contents coverage to september  pursuant to the terms of the agreement  salix paid norgine milestone payments of million in august  million in december and million in december we were amortizing these milestone payments over a period of years through  which we believed was an appropriate amortization period due to the product s patent protection and the estimated economic life of the related intangible 
in august we entered into a sublicense agreement that granted novel laboratories  inc a license to the patents covering moviprep permitting novel to launch a generic moviprep on september  as a result of this agreement  we adjusted the amortization period prospectively  and we are now amortizing the remaining net book value of the intangible asset through september   which is our revised estimate of its remaining economic life 
as a result of this agreement  we assessed whether there was an impairment to the carrying value of the related intangible asset due to its reduced economic life and determined that there was no impairment 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the moviprep intangible was million and million  respectively 
in february  we entered into a master purchase and sale and license agreement with merck co 
inc  to purchase the u 
s prescription pharmaceutical product rights to pepcid oral suspension and diuril oral suspension from merck 
we paid merck million at the closing of this transaction 
the purchase price was fully allocated to product rights and related intangibles  and is being amortized over a period of years 
although pepcid and diuril do not have patent protection  we believe years was an appropriate amortization period based on established product history and management experience 
in may  the fda approved a generic famotidine oral suspension product  and we launched an authorized generic famotidine product 
in june the fda approved another generic famotidine oral suspension product 
as a result of these events  we assessed whether there was an impairment to the carrying value of the related intangible asset 
based on this analysis  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value during the three month period ended june  at december  and  accumulated amortization for the merck products was million and million  respectively 
in july  we acquired the rights to develop and market a granulated formulation of mesalamine from dr 
falk pharma gmbh 
on october   the fda granted marketing approval for apriso for the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults 
in november  we made a million milestone payment to dr 
falk 
in december  we made a million milestone payment to dr 
falk 
we are amortizing these milestone payments over a period of years  which we believe is an appropriate amortization period due to the product s patent protection and the estimated economic life of the related intangible 
at december  and  accumulated amortization for the apriso intangible was million and million  respectively 
in september  we acquired the exclusive  worldwide right to sell metoclopramide zydis trade name metozolv from wilmington pharmaceuticals  llc 
on september  the fda granted marketing approval for metozolv odt metoclopramide hcl mg and mg orally disintegrating tablets 
metozolv odt is indicated for the relief of symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux or short term weeks therapy for adults with symptomatic  documented gastroesophageal reflux who fail to respond to conventional therapy and diabetic gastroparesis or the relief of symptoms in adults associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis 
in october  we made a million milestone payment to wilmington 
we are amortizing this milestone payment over a period of eight years  which we believe is an appropriate amortization period due to the product s patent protection and the estimated economic life of the related intangible 
on november   we received a paragraph iv notification from novel stating that novel had filed an anda application to seek approval to market a generic version of metoclopramide hydrochloride odt  mg and mg 
the notification letter asserted non infringement of us patent no 
 the patent 
upon examination of the relevant sections of the anda  we concluded that the patent would not be enforced against novel laboratories 
as a result of this event  we assessed whether there was an impairment to the carrying value of the related intangible asset 
based on this analysis  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value during the three month period ended december  at december  and accumulated amortization for the metozolv intangible was million and million  respectively 
in february  we acquired an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize the products containing methylnaltrexone bromide  or the mntx compound  marketed under the name relistor  from progenics pharmaceuticals  inc except in japan  where ono pharmaceutical co 
ltd 
has previously licensed the subcutaneous formulation of the drug from progenics and a non exclusive license to manufacture the mntx compound and products containing that compound in the same territory 
relistor subcutaneous injection is indicated for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative care  when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient 
we paid progenics an up front license fee payment of million 
we also agreed to pay development milestone payments of up to million contingent upon achieving specified regulatory approvals and commercialization milestone payments of up to million contingent upon achieving specified targets for net sales 
we must pay progenics of any revenue received from sublicensees in respect of any country outside the united states 
additionally  we must pay progenics royalties based on a percentage ranging from the mid to high teens of net sales by us of any product containing the mntx compound 
we accounted for the progenics transaction as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the 
table of contents acquisition date in its consolidated financial statements 
the determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
as of the acquisition date  the estimated fair value of the assets acquired was million  including our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the transaction discussed above of million which is included as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
we determined this liability amount using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based on the current regulatory status of the methylnaltrexone bromide development programs 
we assess the fair value of the contingent consideration whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value may have changed  primarily as a result of clinical or regulatory results in the related in process development programs 
in december we announced the successful outcome of the phase trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in subjects with chronic  non cancer pain 
as a result of this event  we reassessed the fair value of the contingent consideration and recorded an increase of million and a corresponding charge in the fourth quarter of in december we acquired oceana therapeutics  inc oceana has two products  deflux and solesta 
deflux is indicated for children affected by grades ii iv vesicoureteral reflux  a malformation of the urinary bladder that can result in severe infections of the kidneys and irreversible kidney damage 
deflux has been on the market in the united states since solesta is a biocompatible tissue bulking agent  consisting of dextranomer microspheres and stabilized sodium hyaluronate 
solesta is indicated for the treatment of fecal incontinence in patients years and older who have failed conservative therapy such as diet  fiber therapy  anti motility medications 
it is the only injectable gel to be administered in an outpatient setting without the need for surgery or anesthesia 
solesta was approved by the fda through the premarket approval process as a class iii medical device in may and launched in september by oceana 
solesta also is ce mark approved and marketed in europe 
oceana has a license agreement with q med ab  which provide us the worldwide right to commercialize deflux and solesta 
under the license agreements and a related stock purchase agreement with q med that we have assumed  we are obligated to pay up to million contingent upon achieving specified targets for net sales of solesta over the term of the agreement 
we accounted for the oceana acquisition as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in its consolidated financial statements 
the determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
as of the acquisition date  the estimated fair value of the assets acquired was million  including our estimate of the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the transaction discussed above of million which is included as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
we determined this liability amount using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model 
we assess the fair value of the contingent consideration whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value may have changed  primarily as a result of significant changes in our forecast of net sales for solesta 
allowance for uncollectible accounts based on a review of specific customer balances  industry experience and the current economic environment  we currently reserve for specific past due accounts that might represent collection concerns  plus a percentage of our outstanding trade accounts receivable balance as an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
at december  and this reserve was approximately million and million  respectively 
as a result of our acquisition of oceana in december  at december  the allowance included million related to million of receivables from various institutions outside the united states 
refer to schedule ii valuation and qualifying accounts for a roll forward of the allowance for uncollectible accounts 
cash and cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with maturities from date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents in several different financial instruments with various banks and brokerage houses 
this diversification of risk is consistent with our policy to maintain liquidity and ensure the safety of principal 
at december  and  cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of demand deposits  overnight investments in eurodollars  certificates of deposit and money market funds at reputable financial institutions and did not include any auction rate securities 
we have not experienced any loss of principal or liquidity in any of our cash and cash equivalents 
research and development we expense research and development costs  both internal and externally contracted  as incurred 
for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities  we initially capitalize the advance payment 
we then recognize such amounts as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
at december  and  the net liability related to on going research and development activities was million and million  respectively 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the cost to complete projects and development timelines for their completion cannot be reasonably estimated 
enrollment in clinical trials might 
table of contents be delayed for reasons beyond our control  requiring additional cost and time 
results from clinical trials might not be favorable  or might require us to perform additional unplanned clinical trials  requiring additional cost and time  or resulting in termination of the project 
further  data from clinical trials is subject to varying interpretation  and might be deemed insufficient by the regulatory bodies reviewing applications for marketing approvals  requiring additional cost and time  or resulting in termination of the project 
process development and manufacturing scale up for production of clinical and commercial product supplies might take longer and cost more than our forecasts 
as such  clinical development and regulatory programs are subject to risks and changes that might significantly impact cost projections and timelines 
the following table summarizes costs incurred for our significant projects  in thousands 
we consider a project significant if expected spend for any year exceeds of our development project budget for that year

significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
due to a history of operating losses  resulting in a cumulative loss position  management concluded that a full valuation allowance was needed to offset all of the deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  as of december  at december   management concluded that it was more likely than not that a majority of our deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable income 
this conclusion was based  in part  on our achieving sustained profitability in and projections of positive future earnings 
therefore  we released a significant portion of the valuation allowances related to these deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of we will reassess the ability to realize the deferred tax benefits on a quarterly basis 
if it is more likely than not that we will not realize the deferred tax benefits  then all or a portion of the valuation allowance may need to be re established  which would result in a charge to tax expense 
the release of these valuation allowances resulted in an income tax benefit of million  which was recorded as a discrete item during the year ending december  the release of the valuation allowance will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes 
we continue to provide a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets related to several state net operating loss carryforwards

intangible impairment charges intangible impairment charges for consist of a million impairment charge recorded during the three month period ended june  related to pepcid os  and a million impairment charge recorded during the three month period ended december  related to metozolv 
the pepcid charge was a result of fda approval of two generic famotidine oral suspension products in may and june the metozolv charge was a result of novel filing an anda to seek approval to market a generic version of metoclopramide hydrochloride odt  mg and mg  and our determination that the applicable patent could not be enforced against novel

this represents a reduction in research and development expenses as a percentage of net product revenues to for from for and for  as we have significantly increased revenues over this period 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to the million upfront payment for our march amended license agreement with lupin  increased expenses related to our development program for methylnaltrexone bromide  which we acquired from progenics in february  and increased personnel costs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in expenses related to our development programs for crofelemer as it progressed to a less expensive stage of development  and for rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy  which the fda approved in march the decrease in research and development expenses from to was due primarily to reduced expenses related to our phase studies of rifaximin for ibs  which were completed in late  the million upfront collaboration payment to lupin in that did not recur in  and reduced expenses related to our hepatic encephalopathy development program  which was substantially completed in this decrease was partially offset by increased expenses related to our development programs for crofelemer and budesonide  and increased personnel costs 
since inception through december   we had incurred research and development expense of approximately million for balsalazide  million for rifaximin  million for granulated mesalamine  million for crofelemer  million for methylnaltrexone bromide  and million for budesonide 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory approval processes  the cost to complete projects and development timelines for their completion cannot be reasonably estimated 
enrollment in clinical trials might be delayed or occur faster than anticipated for reasons beyond our control  requiring additional cost and time or accelerating spending

change in acquisition related contingent consideration we accounted for the progenics transaction as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in its consolidated financial statements 
the determination of estimated fair value required management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
as of the acquisition date  the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the transaction was million  which was included as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
we determined this liability amount using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based on the current regulatory status of the methylnaltrexone bromide development programs 
we assess the fair value of the contingent consideration whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value might have changed  primarily as a result of clinical or regulatory results in the related in process development programs 
in december we announced the successful outcome of the phase trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral methylnaltrexone for the treatment of opioid induced constipation in subjects with chronic  non cancer pain 
as a result of this event  we reassessed the fair value of the contingent consideration and recorded an increase of million and a corresponding charge in the fourth quarter of interest expense interest expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively

the release of these valuation allowances resulted in an income tax benefit of million  which was recorded as a discrete item during the year ending december  the release of the valuation allowance will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes 
we are continuing to provide a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets related to several state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   and  we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these carryforwards will expire on various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
utilization of the federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards might be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code 
the annual limitation might result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
we acquired non us tax losses through the acquisition of oceana  which at december  totaled approximately million

net cash provided by investing activities was million in and was primarily due to the decrease in restricted cash as a result of our repayment of our credit facility  net of purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities was million in and was primarily attributable to the approval milestone payment to wilmington pharmaceuticals for metozolv  and purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and tax benefits from stock based compensation 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted primarily of the net proceeds from the closing of our offering of notes in june and proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities of million in consisted primarily of the proceeds of our public offering of common stock closed in november and proceeds from the issuance common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had non cancelable purchase order commitments for inventory purchases of approximately million  which includes any minimum purchase commitments under our manufacturing agreements 
we anticipate significant expenditures related to our on going sales  marketing  product launch efforts and our on going development efforts for rifaximin  our budesonide product candidates  methylnaltrexone bromide and crofelemer 
to the extent we acquire rights to additional products  we will incur additional expenditures

contractual interest and principal obligations related to our convertible senior notes total million at december   including million  million  and million due in one year or less  two to three years  and four to five years  respectively 
we enter into license agreements with third parties that may require us to make royalty  milestone or other payments contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the successful development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products 
certain of the payments are contingent upon the successful achievement of an important event in the development life cycle of these pharmaceutical products  which might or might not occur 
if required by the agreements  we will make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of a pharmaceutical product if regulatory approval to market this product is obtained and the product is commercialized 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  we have not attempted to predict the amount or period in which such payments would possibly be made and thus they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

table of contents in february  we entered into a million revolving credit facility that was to mature in february on august  we amended the credit facility to waive defaults that may have arisen as a result of the approval of three generic balsalazide capsule products by the office of generic drugs on december  and reduced the credit facility to million 
on august  we further amended the credit facility to allow us to issue the notes described below 
on may   the company repaid the million then drawn under our credit facility and terminated the facility 
on august  we closed an offering of million in convertible senior notes due notes 
net proceeds from the offering were million 
the notes are governed by an indenture  dated as of august   between us and us bank national association  as trustee 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning on february  the notes will mature on august   unless previously converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms prior to that date

holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of august  only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied during any fiscal quarter commencing after september   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or more than of the conversion price of the notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes  per  principal amount of the notes  for each such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate of the notes on such date  if we enter into specified corporate transactions  or upon a redemption notice 
the first of these conditions was met as of december  the notes will be convertible  regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions has been satisfied  on or after march  at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of august  upon conversion  we will pay cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and stock  as determined by us in our discretion 
as long as the notes are outstanding  we are prohibited from incurring any debt other than permitted debt  as defined in the indenture  except that we may incur debt in certain circumstances  including meeting a consolidated leverage ratio test and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test 
the notes described below are permitted debt under the indenture 
on june  we closed an offering of million in convertible senior notes due notes 
net proceeds from the offering were million

holders may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date of may  only if one or more of the following conditions is satisfied during any fiscal quarter commencing after june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is equal to or more than of the conversion price of the notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter  during the five business day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the notes  per  principal amount of the notes  for each such trading day was less than of the 
table of contents product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate of the notes on such date  or if we enter into specified corporate transactions 
none of these conditions had been met as of december  the notes will be convertible  regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied  on or after january  at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of may  upon conversion  we may pay cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and stock  as determined by us at our discretion 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties covering approximately  shares of our common stock 
the capped call transactions have a strike price of and a cap price of  and are exercisable when and if the notes are converted 
if upon conversion of the notes  the price of our common stock is above the strike price of the capped calls  the counterparties will deliver shares of our common stock and or cash with an aggregate value approximately equal to the difference between the price of our common stock at the conversion date as defined  with a maximum price for purposes of this calculation equal to the cap price and the strike price  multiplied by the number of shares of our common stock related to the capped call transactions being exercised 
we paid million for these capped calls  and charged that amount to additional paid in capital 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  and cash and cash equivalent balances of million 
at december   cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of demand deposits  certificates of deposit  overnight investments in eurodollars and money market funds at reputable financial institutions  and did not include any auction rate securities 
we believe our cash and cash equivalent balances should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
based on our current projections  we believe that we will continue positive cash flow from operations without requiring additional capital 
however  we might seek additional debt or equity financing or both to fund our operations or acquisitions  and our actual cash needs might vary materially from those now planned because of a number of factors including whether we acquire additional products or companies  risk associated with acquisitions  fda and foreign regulation and regulatory processes  the status of competitive products  including potential generics in an increasingly global industry  intellectual property and related litigation risks in an increasingly global industry  our success selling products  the results of research and development activities  establishment of and change in collaborative relationships  general economic conditions  and technological advances by us and other pharmaceutical companies 
if we incur more debt  we might be restricted in our ability to raise additional capital and might be subject to financial and restrictive covenants 
if we issue additional equity  our stockholders could suffer dilution 
we might also enter into additional collaborative arrangements that could provide us with additional funding in the form of equity  debt  licensing  milestone and or royalty payments 
we might not be able to enter into such arrangements or raise any additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other asu 
asu amends current guidance to allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this amendment an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the provisions of asu are effective for reporting periods beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted 
we adopted asu in the fourth quarter of there was no material impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon adoption of this guidance 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic  presentation of comprehensive income in us gaap asu 
asu requires that comprehensive income and the related components of net income and of other comprehensive income be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu also requires reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements 
however  in december  the fasb issued asu comprehensive income topic  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu asu to defer the requirement to present reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements and allow entities to continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the requirements in effect before asu we adopted this guidance on january  other than a change in presentation  the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
cautionary statement we operate in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following statement highlights some of these risks

risk factors 
statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts are or might constitute forward looking statements under the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of although we believe the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  our expectations might not be attained 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations expressed in the report include  among others intense competition  including from generics in an increasingly global market  the high cost and uncertainty of the research  clinical trials and other development activities involving pharmaceutical products  the unpredictability of regulation and the duration and results of review of new drug applications and investigational new drug applications  the possible impairment of  or inability to obtain intellectual property rights and the costs of obtaining such rights from third parties in an increasingly global market  our dependence on our seven primary pharmaceutical products  particularly xifaxan  and the uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  general economic conditions  our need to maintain profitability  the uncertainty of obtaining  and our dependence on  third parties to manufacture and sell our products  results of pending and any future litigation  and other risk factors detailed from time to time in our sec filings 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our purchases of raw materials and finished goods are denominated primarily in us dollars and purchases denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant 
additionally  our net assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are insignificant and have not historically exposed us to material risk associated with fluctuations in currency rates 
given these facts  we have not considered it necessary to use foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments to manage changes in currency rates 
however  these circumstances might change 
we have outstanding million of convertible senior notes due and million of convertible senior notes due the interest rates on these notes are fixed and therefore they do not expose us to risk related to rising interest rates 
in addition  in connection with the june offering of the notes  we paid million to purchase capped call options covering approximately  shares of our common stock 
if the per share price of our common stock remains below  these call options will be worthless 
if the per share price of our common stock exceeds  then to the extent of the excess  these call options will not provide us protection against dilution from conversion of the notes
