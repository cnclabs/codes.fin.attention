there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those stated above in item a 
under the headings risk factors cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors  as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing and we assume no obligation to update such statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in this annual report on form k 
overview costar group  inc the company or costar is the number one provider of information and analytic services to the commercial real estate industry in the us and the us based on the fact that we offer the most comprehensive commercial real estate database available  have the largest research department in the industry  provide more information and analytic services than any of our competitors and believe we generate more revenues than any of our competitors 
we have created a standardized information and analytic platform where members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information 
our integrated suite of online service offerings includes information about space available for lease  comparable sales information  tenant information  information about properties for sale  internet marketing services  analytical capabilities  information for clients websites  information about industry professionals and their business relationships  data integration  and industry news 
we also provide market research and analysis for commercial real estate investors and lenders via our ppr service offerings  portfolio and debt management and reporting capabilities through our resolve technology service offerings  and real estate management solutions  including lease administration and abstraction services  through our virtual premise service offerings 
our service offerings span all commercial property types  including office  industrial  retail  land  mixed use  hospitality and multifamily 
expansion and development we expect to develop and distribute new services  expand existing services within our current platform including internationally  and expand and develop our sales and marketing organization 
these initiatives are expected to include continued devleopment of costargo  enhancements to our core information services  including our suite of online services  and development of new services for our brokerage clients 
most recently  on august   we launched costargo in the us  costargo is an ipad application that integrates our comprehensive property  tenant and comparable sales information in our suite of online products costar property professional  costar tenant and costar comps professional 
we supported the launch with an extensive marketing campaign during the third quarter of  including a city national launch tour to drive early adoption of the service 
we incurred expenses of approximately million during the third quarter of in connection with the launch of costargo 
we expect to continue to incur additional expenses associated with the marketing and sale of costargo 
we also intend to continue to expand the coverage of our service offerings within our international segment and to integrate our international operations more fully with those in the us we have gained operational efficiencies as a result of consolidating a majority of our uk research operations in one location in glasgow and combining the majority of our remaining uk operations in one central location in london 
we intend to introduce a consistent international platform of service offerings in the upcoming future 
as part of our integration efforts  in  we introduced the costar group as the brand encompassing our international operations  and in early we launched showcase  our internet marketing service that provides commercial real estate professionals high quality internet lead generation  in the uk we expect to introduce costar property professional  costar comps professional  costar tenant and costargo  our ipad application  in the uk in the upcoming future 
additionally  we plan to upgrade back end research operations  fulfillment and crm systems in the uk to support these new uk services 
in order to implement these services in the uk  we have incurred  and expect to incur increased development costs 
we believe that our continued investments in us products  internationalization of our products and integration efforts have created a platform for long term growth  which we intend to continue to develop  invest in and expand 
any future product development or expansion of services could reduce our profitability and increase our capital expenditures 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  driving overall earnings throughout and providing substantial cash flow for our business  it is possible that any new investments could cause us to generate losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
our goal is to provide additional tools that make our research and analytics even more valuable to subscribers 
for example  we are focusing on further integration and development of the services offered by the companies we have most recently acquired  ppr  resolve technology and virtual premise 
we have launched an initiative to develop a lease discounted cash flow ldcf forecasting and valuation solution that effectively integrates the combined capabilities of costar s market and property information and ppr s analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology s and virtual premise s commercial real estate investment and management software expertise 
in order to implement this initiative  we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur additional costs 
while our investments in ppr  resolve technology and virtual premise have resulted and may continue to result in an increase in expenses  our revenues have also increased as a result of these acquisitions  and we have experienced increased cross selling opportunities among costar and the acquired companies 
on april   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire loopnet 
pursuant to the merger agreement  as a result of the merger a each outstanding share of loopnet common stock will be converted into a unit consisting of i in cash  without interest and ii shares of costar common stock  and b each outstanding share of loopnet series a convertible preferred stock  unless previously converted into loopnet common stock  will be converted into a unit consisting of i the product of multiplied by the cash consideration and ii the product of multiplied by the stock consideration  representing a total equity value of approximately million and an enterprise value of million as of april  the holders of loopnet s series a convertible preferred stock delivered contingent conversion notices to loopnet pursuant to which such shares will be converted into loopnet common stock immediately prior to  and contingent upon  the completion of the merger 
the boards of directors of costar and loopnet have unanimously approved the transaction  and the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of loopnet s common stock and series a preferred stock  voting together as a single class on an as converted basis  have approved adoption of the merger agreement on july  we intend to fund the cash portion of the consideration payable to loopnet stockholders in the merger through a combination of cash on hand  including the net proceeds of approximately million from an equity offering we completed in june and the proceeds of a million term loan facility available to us under a credit agreement  dated february   by and among costar  as borrower  costar realty information  inc  as co borrower  the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan bank  as administrative agent 
the obligation of the lenders to make the loans under the credit agreement is subject to the simultaneous closing of the merger with loopnet and the satisfaction of certain other conditions precedent 
the proceeds of a million revolving credit facility also available to us under the credit agreement may be used  on the closing date of the loopnet merger  to pay for transaction costs related to the merger and  thereafter  for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in addition  we received a commitment letter from jp morgan bank on april  for a fully committed term loan of million and a million revolving credit facility  of which million is committed 
this commitment letter remains outstanding and available  subject to customary conditions  to fund the loopnet acquisition and our ongoing working capital needs following the closing 
however  we do not currently anticipate utilizing this commitment 
the loopnet transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act 
as previously disclosed in the proxy statement prospectus dated june   both costar and loopnet filed notification and report forms with the department of justice and the ftc pursuant to the hsr act  on may  as a result  the waiting period under the hsr act with respect to the proposed merger between costar and loopnet the merger was scheduled to expire on june  as previously reported in a current report on form k  on june   costar and loopnet each received a request for additional information commonly referred to as a second request from the ftc with respect to the proposed merger 
at the ftc s request  costar and loopnet subsequently agreed to extend the waiting period imposed by the hsr act from to days after the date of substantial compliance with the second request unless that period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the ftc 
on november   each of the company and loopnet certified as to its substantial compliance with the second request 
as previously disclosed on january   costar and loopnet voluntarily agreed to further extend the waiting period imposed by the hsr act on a day rolling basis to allow them to engage in discussions with the ftc to determine whether there is a possible basis for  and to discuss the possible terms of  a mutually acceptable consent order that would allow the merger to close 
on january   costar and loopnet mutually agreed to extend the date after which either party may individually elect to terminate the merger agreement from january  to april  while there can be no assurance that agreement on the terms of a possible consent order can be reached in a timely manner or at all  the company believes the discussions with the ftc staff are currently proceeding constructively and the company is hopeful that they will in the near term result in an agreement with the ftc staff on the terms of such a consent order  subject to ftc approval 
in certain circumstances set forth in the loopnet merger agreement  if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated  loopnet may be obligated to pay us a termination fee of million 
similarly  in certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement  if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated  we may be obligated to pay loopnet a termination fee of million 
in light of our agreement to acquire loopnet  we are currently evaluating how best to integrate the two businesses 
we expect that while we await final antitrust approval of the transaction we will continue to assess and finalize any plans for additional investments in our business for the foreseeable future 
at this time  we expect to continue to develop and distribute new services within our current platform 
we expect to continue our efforts to integrate the combined capabilities of costar s market and property information and ppr s analytics and forecasting expertise with resolve technology s real estate investment software expertise 
we also plan to continue efforts to integrate virtual premise s real estate management solutions with costar s business 
while we expect current service offerings to remain profitable  driving overall earnings for and providing substantial cash flow for our business  our proposed merger with loopnet and the subsequent integration of our two businesses could reduce our profitability  cause us to generate losses and adversely affect our financial position 
further  our credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that will restrict our operations and use of our cash flow if the loopnet acquisition is completed 
market conditions there continue to be clear signs of improving conditions in the commercial real estate industry  including strong leasing activity and positive net absorption of office space 
however  the extent and duration of continued improvement of the economy and the commercial real estate industry is unknown 
continuing risks related to lower than expected job growth  spiking energy costs and uncertainty over us and global economic issues may impede the ability and willingness of clients to purchase services from us or result in reductions of services purchased 
in some cases  the business operations of some of our clients continue to be negatively affected by challenging economic conditions in the us and the world  resulting at times in business consolidations and  in some circumstances  business failure 
if cancellations  reductions of services and failures to pay increase  and we are unable to offset the resulting decrease in revenue by increasing sales to new or existing customers  our revenues may decline or grow at reduced rates 
we compete against many other commercial real estate information and analytic service providers for business 
if customers choose to cancel our services for cost cutting or other reasons  our revenue could decline 
financial matters our financial reporting currency is the us dollar 
changes in exchange rates can significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends 
we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the us economy through our international businesses benefits our stockholders over the long term 
we also believe it is important to evaluate our operating results before and after the effect of currency changes  as it may provide a more accurate comparison of our results of operations over historical periods 
currency exchange rate volatility may continue  which may impact either positively or negatively our reported financial results and consolidated trends and period to period comparisons of our consolidated operations 
we currently issue stock options and or restricted stock to our officers  directors and employees  and as a result we record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
we plan to continue the use of stock based compensation for our officers  directors and employees  which may include  among other things  restricted stock  restricted stock units or stock option grants that typically will require us to record additional compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations and reduce our net income 
property developments on february   we took advantage of favorable market conditions and purchased an office building in downtown washington  dc for million for use as our new headquarters and have since relocated to this location the dc office building 
the lease for our previous headquarters in bethesda  md expired on october   therefore  we incurred overlapping occupancy costs through the end of the bethesda lease term as we transitioned to our new headquarters 
we were able to create value through our occupancy of the dc office building and on february  sold the building for aggregate consideration of million  million of which was designated to fund additional build out and planned improvements at the building 
approximately million of the million additional build out is recorded as a leasehold improvement in property and equipment 
as part of the sale  we entered into a long term lease with the buyer to lease back approximately of the office space  where our corporate headquarters is expected to remain 
during the third quarter of  we incurred approximately million of restructuring costs associated with the consolidation of our white marsh  maryland office with our columbia  maryland and washington  dc offices 
subscription based services our subscription based information services  consisting primarily of costar property professional  costar tenant  costar comps professional  and focus services currently generate approximately of our total revenues 
costar property professional  costar tenant  and costar comps professional are generally sold as a suite of similar services and comprise our primary service offering in our us operating segment 
focus is our primary service offering in our international operating segment 
the majority of our contracts for our subscription based information services typically have a minimum term of one year and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the subscription contract rates may change in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge a fixed monthly amount for our subscription based information services rather than fees based on actual system usage 
contract rates are generally based on the number of sites  number of users  organization size  the client s business focus  geography and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
our subscription clients generally pay contract fees on a monthly basis  but in some cases may pay us on a quarterly or annual basis 
we recognize this revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the contract 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
for the twelve months ended december  and  our contract renewal rate for subscription based services was approximately and  respectively  and therefore our cancellation rate was approximately and  respectively  for the same periods of time 
our contract renewal rate is a quantitative measurement that is typically closely correlated with our revenue results 
as a result  management also believes that the rate may be a reliable indicator of short term and long term performance 
our trailing twelve month contract renewal rate may decline if negative economic conditions lead to greater business failures and or consolidations among our clients  further reductions in customer spending  or decreases in our customer base 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different acceptable assumptions would yield different results 
changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
fair value of auction rate securities fair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
there is a three tier fair value hierarchy  which categorizes assets and liabilities by the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level  defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets  level  defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level  defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions 
our level assets consist of auction rate securities ars  whose underlying assets are primarily student loan securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education 
our ars investments are not currently trading and therefore do not currently have a readily determinable market value 
the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximates par value 
we have used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our investment in ars as of december  the assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model include estimates for interest rates  credit spreads  timing and amount of cash flows  liquidity risk premiums  expected holding periods and default risk of the ars 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of december   we determined there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million 
the decline was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers of these ars are unable to successfully close future auctions and or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments  which would reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial position 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine the fair value of the ars 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to determine the unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair value of the ars as of december  however  if changes in these assumptions occur  and  should those changes be significant  we may be exposed to additional unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss or an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings on these investments 
fair value of deferred consideration we had no level liabilities as of december  as of december   we held level liabilities for deferred consideration related to the october  acquisition of resolve technology 
the deferred consideration totaled million as of december  and included i a potential deferred cash payment two years after closing based on the incremental growth of resolve technology s revenue  and ii other potential deferred cash payments for successful completion of operational and sales milestones during the period from closing through october   which period may be extended by the parties to a date no later than december  on june   we made a payment to the seller of resolve technology of  as a result of the successful completion of one of the operational milestones 
on september   we entered into an agreement to settle all remaining potential deferred cash payments due under the original agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we made a payment of million on september  to settle the entire obligation 
we reversed the remaining million originally recorded as deferred consideration by reducing general and administrative expense during the three months ended september  prior to the settlement on september   we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the estimated fair value of our level liabilities 
the significant assumptions used in preparing the discounted cash flow model included the discount rate  estimates for future incremental revenue growth and probabilities for completion of operational and sales milestones 
stock based compensation we account for equity instruments issued in exchange for employee services using a fair value based method and we recognize the fair value of such equity instruments as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires us to estimate the dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life of the stock option 
these assumptions and the estimation of expected forfeitures are based on multiple factors  including historical employee behavior patterns of exercising options and post employment termination behavior  expected future employee option exercise patterns  and the historical volatility of the company s stock price 
we do not expect any material changes in the near term to the underlying assumptions used to calculate stock based compensation expense for the twelve months ended december  however  if significant changes in these assumptions occur  they could have a material impact on our stock based compensation expense 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
judgments made by management relate to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows of the carrying amounts of such assets 
the accuracy of these judgments may be adversely affected by several factors  including the factors listed below significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we test for impairment 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets that are not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment by each reporting unit on october of each year and are also tested for impairment more frequently based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators 
we consider our operating segments  us and international  as our reporting units under fasb authoritative guidance for consideration of potential impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on a projected discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions and estimates including our future financial performance and a weighted average cost of capital 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the process is performed to measure the impairment loss 
we measure impairment loss based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk in our current business model 
as of october   the date of our most recent impairment analysis  the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value of our reporting units 
there have been no events or changes in circumstances since the date of our impairment analysis on october  that would indicate that the carrying value of either reporting unit may not be recoverable 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change the allowance in a period  we must reflect the corresponding increase or decrease within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures in our public releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we may disclose include ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
ebitda is our net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we typically disclose ebitda on a consolidated and an operating segment basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
adjusted ebitda is different from ebitda because we further adjust ebitda for stock based compensation expense  acquisition related costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs and settlements and impairments incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are similarly adjusted for stock based compensation expense  acquisition related costs  restructuring costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs  settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business as well as purchase amortization and other related costs 
we may disclose adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share on a consolidated basis in our earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the non gaap financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
also  in the future  we may disclose different non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our results of operations to our previously reported results of operations or to those of other companies in our industry 
we view ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share as operating performance measures and as such we believe that the most directly comparable gaap financial measure is net income loss 
in calculating ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share  we exclude from net income loss the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day to day operation of our business 
we have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non gaap financial measures as a result of these exclusions 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity  as an alternative to net income loss or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share as a substitute for any gaap financial measure  including net income loss 
in addition  we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share may be used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and may be used by investors as supplemental financial measures to evaluate the performance of our business 
we believe that these non gaap measures  when viewed with our gaap results and the accompanying reconciliation  provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business 
we have spent more than years building our database of commercial real estate information and expanding our markets and services partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses 
due to the expansion of our information and analytic services  which included acquisitions  our net income loss has included significant charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization  acquisition costs and restructuring costs 
adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share exclude these charges and provide meaningful information about the operating performance of our business  apart from charges for purchase amortization  depreciation and other amortization  acquisition costs  restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
we believe the disclosure of non gaap measures can help investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year 
we also believe the non gaap measures we disclose are measures of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non cash charges  such as amortization and depreciation  and other items  such as interest  income taxes  stock based compensation expenses  acquisition costs  headquarters acquisition and transition related costs  restructuring costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business  provides additional information about our cost structure  and  over time  helps track our operating progress 
in addition  investors  securities analysts and others have regularly relied on ebitda and may rely on adjusted ebitda  non gaap net income or non gaap net income per diluted share to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the use of our acquired database technology  which is one of the sources of information for our database of commercial real estate information 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
purchase amortization in operating expenses may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of any acquired trade names 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
depreciation and other amortization may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of net interest income we generate may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows 
however  we do not consider the amount of net interest income to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
income tax expense benefit may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business 
however  we do not consider the amount of income tax expense benefit to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate adjusted ebitda and the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues  purchase amortization in operating expenses  depreciation and other amortization  interest income  net  and income tax expense benefit as previously described above with respect to the calculation of ebitda 
stock based compensation expense may be useful for investors to consider because it represents a portion of the compensation of our employees and executives 
determining the fair value of the stock based instruments involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and the expenses recorded may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the future exercise or termination of the related stock based awards 
therefore  we believe it is useful to exclude stock based compensation in order to better understand the long term performance of our core business 
the amount of acquisition related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent professional service fees and direct expenses related to the acquisition 
because we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle we do not consider the amount of acquisition related costs to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of restructuring costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent costs incurred in connection with a change in the makeup of our properties or personnel 
we do not consider the amount of restructuring related costs to be a representative component of the day to day operating performance of our business 
the amount of headquarters acquisition and transition related costs incurred may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent the overlapping rent and building carrying costs  legal costs and other related costs incurred to relocate our headquarters 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing charges related to our operating cost structure 
the amount of material settlement and impairment costs incurred outside of our ordinary course of business may be useful for investors to consider because they generally represent gains or losses from the settlement of litigation matters 
we do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure 
the financial items that have been excluded from our net income loss to calculate non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share are stock based compensation  acquisition related costs  restructuring costs  headquarter acquisition and transition related costs and settlement and impairment costs incurred outside our ordinary course of business 
these items are discussed above with respect to the calculation of adjusted ebitda along with the material limitations associated with using this non gaap financial measure as compared to net income loss 
we subtract an assumed provision for income taxes to calculate non gaap net income 
we assume a tax rate in order to approximate our long term effective corporate tax rate 
non gaap net income per diluted share is a non gaap financial measure that represents non gaap net income divided by the number of diluted shares outstanding for the period used in the calculation of gaap net income per diluted share 
management compensates for the above described limitations of using non gaap measures by using a non gaap measure only to supplement our gaap results and to provide additional information that is useful to understand the factors and trends affecting our business

on october   we acquired virtual premise  a saas provider of real estate information management solutions 
pursuant to the terms of the acquisition agreement  we paid approximately million in cash  approximately of which was paid on the closing date to the virtual premise stockholders and the remaining of which will be held in escrow until paid days after the closing date  subject to use of such funds to satisfy any post closing net working capital adjustments or indemnification claims made prior to such date 
the purchase price was later reduced by approximately  after taking into account post closing purchase price adjustments and this amount is expected to be paid to us from the escrow fund 
accounting treatment 
we have applied the acquisition method to account for the virtual premise transaction which requires that  among other things  assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
the purchase price was allocated to tradenames  customer base  database technology  goodwill and various other asset and liability accounts 
the acquired customer base for the acquisitions  which consists of one distinct intangible asset and is composed of acquired customer contracts and the related customer relationships  is being amortized on a declining balance method over ten years 
the identified intangibles are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill for these acquisitions is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
the results of operations of virtual premise have been consolidated with those of the company since the date of the acquisition and are not considered material to our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  pro forma financial information has not been presented for the acquisition 
the purchase accounting is preliminary and is subject to change 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended december  was primarily due to million in net proceeds from our equity offering in june of  shares of common stock for per share 
in addition  in february  we sold the  square foot office building located at l street  nw  in downtown washington  dc for million in cash  million of which was designated to fund additional build out and planned improvements at the building 
changes in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are dependent upon changes in  among other things  working capital items such as accounts receivable  accounts payable  various accrued expenses and deferred revenues  as well as changes in our capital structure due to stock option exercises  purchases and sales of short term investments and similar events 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to a decrease of approximately million from net income plus non cash items partially offset by a million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities due to differences in timing of collection of receipts and payments of disbursements 
the million decrease from net income plus non cash items was primarily related to a decrease in changes in deferred income taxes  net of approximately million 
the change in deferred income taxes  net of million is primarily comprised of approximately million related to the tax treatment of the deferred gain on the sale of the building and approximately million related to the tax treatment of acquisition related costs associated with the pending loopnet acquisition 
the million net increase in changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily related to an increase in changes in income tax receivable of approximately million partially offset by a decrease in changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately million 
the increase in changes in income tax receivable of approximately million was due to the collection of approximately million of the million income tax receivable recorded in  as the tax legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of allowed us to deduct of qualifying assets purchased after september  the decrease in changes in accounts payable and other liabilities of approximately million was primarily due to the million payment made for the deferred consideration for the year ended december   as a result of the settlement of the deferred consideration related to the company s october  acquisition of resolve technology 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details of the deferred consideration settlement 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this million increased change in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to the sale of our new headquarters in downtown washington  dc  in february as well as the february purchase of that building partially offset by the acquisition of virtual premise 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the equity offering of  shares of common stock for per share completed in june net proceeds from the equity offering were approximately million  after deducting approximately million of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses of approximately  contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands total and thereafter operating leases purchase obligations total contractual principal cash obligations amounts do not include i contracts with terms of twelve months or less  or ii multi year contracts that may be terminated by a third party or us 
amounts do not include unrecognized tax benefits of million due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash payments 
concurrent with the sale of the  square foot office building located at l street  nw  in downtown washington  dc  we entered into a lease with gll l street  llc gll to lease back  square feet of the office space located in the building for use as our corporate headquarters 
the lease will expire may  subject to two year renewal options 
the initial base rent is per square foot of occupied space  escalating per year commencing june  minimum lease payments will be approximately million  million  million  million and million for fiscal years through  respectively  and a total of million from to the end of the lease term 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our operating results  expansion efforts  and our level of acquisition activity or other strategic transactions 
during  we incurred capital expenditures of approximately million 
we expect to make capital expenditures in of approximately million to million 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we may use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions

in june  we completed an equity offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use these proceeds to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the acquisition of loopnet 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement by and among costar  as borrower  costar realty information  inc  as co borrower  the lenders from time to time party thereto and jpmorgan bank  as administrative agent 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility  each with a term of five years 
the obligation of the lenders to make the loans under the credit agreement is subject to the simultaneous closing of the merger with loopnet and the satisfaction of certain other conditions precedent 
we expect to use the proceeds of the term loan facility on the date on which such conditions are satisfied along with net proceeds from the equity offering in june to pay a portion of the merger consideration and transaction costs related to the merger 
the proceeds of the revolving credit facility may be used  on the closing date  to pay for transaction costs related to the merger and  thereafter  for working capital and other general corporate purposes of costar and its subsidiaries 
the original commitment letter from jp morgan bank received on april  remains outstanding and available  subject to customary conditions  to fund the loopnet acquisition and the ongoing working capital needs of costar and its subsidiaries following the loopnet transaction until the earlier of funding of the term loan facility into escrow pursuant to the credit agreement  if applicable  and the business day after the beginning of the marketing period under the merger agreement 
however  we do not currently anticipate utilizing that original commitment 
in connection with obtaining the facility pursuant to the credit agreement  we expect to incur approximately million in debt issuance costs  which will be capitalized and amortized as interest expense over the term of the credit agreement using the effective interest method 
the debt issuance costs will be comprised of approximately million in underwriting fees and approximately million primarily related to legal fees associated with the debt issuance 
we have incurred approximately  in debt issuance costs as of december  and have paid approximately  the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including antitrust clearance 
we have expensed approximately million in acquisition related costs in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as a result of the pending loopnet acquisition  of which we have paid approximately million and expect to pay the remaining balance in we expect to incur approximately million to million in additional acquisition related costs 
the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of loopnet s common stock and series a convertible preferred stock  voting together as a single class on an as converted basis  approved the adoption of the merger agreement on july  the transaction is not subject to a financing condition 
in certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement  if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated  loopnet may be obligated to pay us a termination fee of million 
similarly  in certain circumstances set forth in the merger agreement  if the merger is not consummated or the agreement is terminated  we may be obligated to pay loopnet a termination fee of million 
we are not in a position yet to estimate the financial impact the proposed merger will have on our operations 
we engaged jp morgan securities llc jp morgan to act as our financial advisor in connection with the acquisition 
we are obligated to pay million to jp morgan if the acquisition closes 
completion of the merger remains subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the hsr act and other customary closing conditions 
as of december   the parties have not yet reached agreement with the ftc on the terms of a consent order with the ftc  and there can be no assurance that such agreement will be reached in a timely manner or at all 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
as of december   we had million par value of long term investments in student loan ars  which failed to settle at auctions 
the majority of these investments are of high credit quality with aaa credit ratings and are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the federal family education loan program ffelp of the us department of education 
while we continue to earn interest on these investments  the investments are not liquid in the short term 
in the event we need to immediately access these funds  we may have to sell these securities at an amount below par value 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and other short term investments and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these investments below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we provide information and analytic services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the us  us and france 
our functional currency for our operations in the uk and france is the local currency 
as such  fluctuations in the british pound and euro may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial position 
for the year ended december   revenue denominated in foreign currencies was approximately of total revenue 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have decreased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used strengthened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the carrying amount of net assets 
for the year ended december   our revenue would have increased by approximately million if the us dollar exchange rate used weakened by 
in addition  we have assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
a weakening of the us dollar exchange rate against all currencies with which we have exposure at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the carrying amount of net assets 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations with respect to our foreign subsidiaries 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully  on acceptable terms or at all 
as of december   accumulated other comprehensive loss included a loss from foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately million 
we do not have material exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
if there is an increase or decrease in interest rates  there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not believe that increases or decreases in interest rates will impact our ability to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
included within our long term investments are investments in mostly aaa rated student loan ars 
these securities are primarily securities supported by guarantees from the ffelp of the us department of education 
as of december   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed 
as a result  we may not be able to sell these investments at par value until a future auction on these investments is successful 
in the event we need to immediately liquidate these investments  we may have to locate a buyer outside the auction process  who may be unwilling to purchase the investments at par  resulting in a loss 
based on an assessment of fair value of these investments in ars as of december   we determined that there was a decline in the fair value of our ars investments of approximately million  which was deemed to be a temporary impairment and recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments as a temporary impairment and recognize a greater unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss or as an other than temporary impairment charge to earnings 
based on our ability to access our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate having to sell these securities below par value in order to operate our business in the foreseeable future 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have approximately million in intangible assets as of december  as of december   we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  however  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets
