overview of fiscal year during fiscal year  we continued to see good performance from acquisitions  investments in our ongoing technology and sales and marketing initiatives 
our overall revenue in fiscal year increased million  or  as compared to fiscal year  reflecting an increase of million  or  in our human health segment revenue and an increase of million  or  in our environmental health segment revenue 
the increase in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year was due primarily to growth generated from both our diagnostics and our medical imaging businesses  partially offset by weakening demand in the research market 
the increase in our environmental health segment revenue during fiscal year was due primarily to growth generated from our environmental  food and consumer safety and testing products  as well as in the industrial markets primarily related to chemical processing and energy applications supported by our molecular spectroscopy and chromatography platforms 
we also experienced continued growth in our onesource multivendor service offering as our comprehensive service offering continues to grow with our key customers 
in our human health segment during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  we experienced growth in the diagnostics market from increased demand for our neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings  particularly in emerging markets such as china and brazil 
in our medical imaging business  we had continued growth from industrial and veterinary applications  as well as demand for our newly acquired complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos imaging technology for orthopedic surgical and industrial applications 
we also completed our strategic acquisition of dexela limited dexela  which is intended to add complementary imaging technology that should expand our medical imaging business and diversify our customer base 
the increases attributable to these factors were partially offset by the impact of tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market 
we experienced growth in the research market due to continued demand for our pre clinical offerings including our operetta cellular imaging instrument utilized for in vitro research  our fluorescent reagents utilized for in vivo imaging  our janus automation tools and our envision and enspire multi mode plate readers 
the growth in the research market was offset in part by reduced sales to pharmaceutical companies resulting from continued customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market 
despite this decline  we are encouraged by growth in china and india as demand from internal pharmaceutical research is migrating to lower cost regions 
we also completed our strategic acquisition of caliper life sciences  inc caliper  which is intended to enhance our molecular imaging and detection technologies and to complement our offerings in life science  diagnostics  environmental and food markets 
as the rising cost of healthcare continues to be one of the critical issues facing our customers  we anticipate that even with continued pressure on lab budgets and credit availability  the benefits of providing earlier detection of disease  which can result in savings of long term health care costs as well as creating better outcomes for patients  are increasingly valued and we expect to see continued growth in these markets 
in our environmental health segment  sales of environmental  food and consumer safety and testing products grew in fiscal year as increased regulations in environmental and food safety markets continue to drive strong demand for our analytical instrumentation and follow on consumables 
we saw continued strength in our inorganic analysis solutions  such as our recently launched nexion mass spectrometer  as trace metals identification remains a critical component of contaminant detection for environmental  as well as food and consumer safety  applications 
we also had continued growth in our molecular spectroscopy offering utilized primarily for materials analysis  chemical processing and semi conductor applications in the industrial markets 
we believe these trends will continue as emerging contaminant testing protocols and corresponding regulations are developed  resulting in continued demand for highly efficient  analytically sensitive and information rich testing 
table of contents solutions 
our laboratory services business continued to grow during fiscal year by adding new customers to our onesource multivendor service offering  as well as continued growth of our comprehensive service offering with our key customers 
our laboratory services business offers services designed to enable our customers to increase efficiencies and production time  while reducing maintenance costs  all of which continue to be critical for our customers 
we also completed our strategic acquisition of cambridgesoft corporation cambridgesoft  a provider of scientific databases and professional services 
this acquisition is intended to expand our software offerings to provide customers with solutions that help them create  analyze and communicate scientific data while improving the speed  quality  efficiency and predictability of their research and development investments 
our consolidated gross margins decreased basis points in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  due to the fiscal year mark to market charge for our postretirement benefit plans  changes in product mix with growth in sales of lower gross margin product offerings and increased freight costs  partially offset by increased sales volume and cost containment and productivity initiatives 
our consolidated operating margin decreased basis points in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of the fiscal year mark to market charge for our postretirement benefit plans  increased costs related to acquisitions  increased sales and marketing expenses  particularly in emerging territories  increased freight costs  and growth investments in research and development  partially offset by cost containment and productivity initiatives 
we believe we are well positioned to continue to take advantage of the stable spending trends in our end markets and to promote our efficiencies in markets where current conditions may increase demand for certain services 
overall  we believe that our strategic focus on human health and environmental health coupled with our breadth of end markets  deep portfolio of technologies and applications  leading market positions  global scale and financial strength will provide us with a strong foundation for continued growth

acquisition of remaining interest in the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry joint venture 
in may  we acquired the remaining fifty percent equity interest in the icpms joint venture and other related tangible assets from dh technologies development pte ltd  a subsidiary of danaher corporation danaher 
we expect this acquisition will help support the continued success of the premier icpms product line by allowing us to direct development with a dedicated and consistent approach 
the fair value of the acquisition was million  including cash consideration of million  non cash consideration of million for certain non exclusive rights to intangible assets owned by us  and million representing the fair value of our fifty percent equity interest in the icpms joint venture held prior to the acquisition 
we recognized a pre tax gain of million from the re measurement to fair value of our previously held equity interest in the icpms joint venture 
this pre tax gain is reported in interest and other expense income  net  for fiscal year the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to us  as well as non capitalizable intangible assets  and has been allocated to goodwill  none of which is tax deductible 
we have reported the operations for this acquisition within the results of our environmental health segment from the acquisition date 
we do not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal year  with the exception of the caliper acquisition  to be material to our consolidated results of operations  therefore  we are not presenting pro forma financial information of operations 
the aggregate revenue for the acquisitions  with the exception of caliper  completed during fiscal year for the period from their respective acquisition dates to january  was million 
we have also determined that the presentation of the results of operations for each of those acquisitions  from the date of acquisition  is impracticable due to the integration of the operations upon acquisition 
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date  based on revenue thresholds or product development milestones achieved through given dates  with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite lived intangible assets 
in connection with the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of deferred revenue assumed with our acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of deferred revenue is determined by the legal performance obligation at the date of acquisition  and is generally based on the nature of the activities to be performed and the related costs to be incurred after the acquisition date 
the fair value of an assumed liability related to deferred revenue is estimated based on the current market cost of fulfilling the obligation  plus a normal profit margin thereon 
the estimated costs to fulfill the deferred revenue are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the services 
we do not include any costs associated with selling effort  research and development  or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
in most acquisitions  profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired businesses would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value 
table of contents determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating income approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the obligation 
as a result of purchase accounting  we recognized the deferred revenue related to the acquisitions completed in fiscal year at fair value and recorded a liability of million  which represents a million difference between the million of deferred revenue that was recorded on the pre acquisition balance sheets of the acquired businesses 
as of january   with the exception of the purchase price and related allocations for the caliper acquisition  the purchase price and related allocations for acquisitions completed in fiscal years and were final 
the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the caliper acquisition was based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions underlying the preliminary valuation are subject to change within the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition dates 
the primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances  and residual goodwill 
we expect to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period 
during the measurement period  we will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
adjustments to the initial allocation of the purchase price during the measurement period require the revision of comparative prior period financial information when reissued in subsequent financial statements 
the effect of measurement period adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price would be as if the adjustments had been completed on the acquisition date 
the effects of measurement period adjustments may cause changes in depreciation  amortization  or other income or expense recognized in prior periods 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
contingencies  including tax matters we are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and  along with other companies  have been named a potentially responsible party prp for certain waste disposal sites 
we accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
we have accrued million as of january   which represents our management s estimate of the total cost of ultimate disposition of known environmental matters 
this amount is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements 
these cost estimates are subject to a number of variables  including the stage of the environmental investigations  the magnitude of the possible contamination  the nature of the potential remedies  possible joint and several liability  the time period over which remediation may occur  and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations 
for sites where we have been named a prp  our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute 
we expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years 
as assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had  or are expected to have  a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
while it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred  the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded 
enzo biochem  inc and enzo life sciences  inc 
collectively  enzo filed a complaint dated october  in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
 against amersham plc  amersham biosciences  perkinelmer  inc  perkinelmer life sciences  inc  sigma aldrich corporation  sigma chemical company  inc  molecular probes  inc  and orchid biosciences  inc the new york case 
the complaint alleges that we have breached our distributorship and settlement agreements with enzo  infringed enzo s patents  engaged in unfair competition and fraud  and committed torts against enzo by  among other things  engaging in commercial development and exploitation of enzo s patented products and technology  separately and together with the other defendants 
enzo seeks injunctive and monetary relief 
in  the court severed the lawsuit and ordered enzo to serve individual complaints against the five defendants 
we subsequently filed an answer and a counterclaim alleging that enzo s patents are invalid 
in july  the court issued a decision regarding the construction of the claims in enzo s patents that effectively limited the coverage of certain of those claims and  we believe  excludes certain of our products from the coverage of enzo s patents 
summary judgment motions were filed by the defendants in january  and a hearing with oral argument on those motions took place in july in january  the case was assigned to a new district court judge and in march  the new judge denied the pending summary judgment motions without prejudice and ordered a stay of the case until the federal appellate court decides enzo s appeal of the judgment of the united states district court for the district of connecticut in enzo biochem vs 
applera corp 
and tropix  inc the connecticut case  which involves a number of the same patents and which could materially affect the scope of enzo s case against us 
on march   the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part the judgment in the connecticut case 
the new york case against us and other 
table of contents defendants remains stayed except that the district court has permitted us and the other defendants to jointly file a motion for summary judgment on certain patent and other issues common to all of the defendants 
we believe we have meritorious defenses to the matter described above  and we are contesting the action vigorously 
while this matter is subject to uncertainty  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we re measured several of our uncertain tax positions related to fiscal years through during fiscal years   and based on new information arising from events during the year that affected positions for those years 
we also settled several income tax audits worldwide 
the re measurements and closure of audits included uncertain tax positions in italy  hong kong  the united kingdom  australia  the philippines  and the federal and certain state governments within the united states 
the net effect of these re measurements and closure of audits  statute of limitations lapses  provision to return adjustments  interest expense accruals  as well as other discrete items  resulted in the recognition of million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year  million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year and million of income tax benefits in continuing operations during fiscal year tax years ranging from through remain open to examination by various tax jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  such as singapore  canada  finland  germany  the united kingdom and the united states 
the tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
we are also subject to various other claims  legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable  in the opinion of our management  based on its review of the information available at this time  the total cost of resolving these other contingencies at january  should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
however  each of these matters is subject to uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us

as a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules  we did not recognize million of revenue in our human health segment for fiscal year and million for fiscal year that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods 
this increase in our human health segment revenue during fiscal year was due primarily to increased demand from the adoption of our neonatal and infectious disease screening offerings in the diagnostics market  increased growth for pre clinical instruments and reagents in the research market  and continued growth from non medical applications of our imaging technology in our medical imaging business 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of lower birth rates in the united states and tight inventory management in state and national labs for neonatal screening in the diagnostics market  as well as reduced revenue to pharmaceutical companies resulting from continued customer consolidations in the pharmaceutical market and reduced demand for our legacy radioisotope portfolio in the research market

notes maturing employee benefit plans unrecognized tax benefits total in thousands thereafter total the credit facility borrowings carry variable interest rates  the amounts included in this table do not contemplate interest obligations 
as of january  the notes had a carrying value of million 
the amount includes accrued interest  net of tax benefits  and penalties 
we have excluded million  including accrued interest  net of tax benefits  and penalties  from the amount related to our uncertain tax positions as we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
purchase commitments are minimal and have been excluded from this table 
capital expenditures during fiscal year  we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year  primarily to introduce new products  to improve our operating processes  to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations  and to develop information technology 
we expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures 
other potential liquidity considerations at january   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and a senior unsecured revolving credit facility with million available for additional borrowing 
most of our cash is denominated in foreign currencies 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
as a result of the caliper acquisition  we concluded that certain foreign operations did not require the same level of capital as previously expected  and therefore we plan to repatriate approximately million of previously unremitted earnings and have provided for the estimated taxes on the repatriation of those earnings 
as a result of the planned repatriation  we recorded an increase to our tax provision of million in continuing operations 
we expect to utilize tax attributes  primarily those acquired in the caliper acquisition  to minimize the cash taxes paid on the repatriation 
with the exception of million we intend to repatriate over the next two 
table of contents to three years related to the acquisition of caliper  we expect accumulated non us cash balances will remain outside of the non us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows  use of us cash balances  external borrowings  or some combination of these sources 
on october   we announced that our board authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of common stock under a stock repurchase program the repurchase program 
on august   we announced that our board had authorized us to repurchase an additional million shares of common stock under the repurchase program 
the repurchase program will expire on october  unless terminated earlier by our board  and may be suspended or discontinued at any time 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions  under the repurchase program 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions  under the repurchase program 
during fiscal year  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of million  including commissions  under the repurchase program 
as of january   approximately million shares of common stock remained available for repurchase from the million shares authorized by our board under the repurchase program 
our board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of million 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of million 
the repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares  with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value 
any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs 
if we continue to repurchase shares  the repurchase program will be funded using our existing financial resources  including cash and cash equivalents  and our existing amended senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
distressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability  creating increased volatility in security prices  widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments 
the widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold 
increases in credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable  could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
in difficult global financial markets  we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost  or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities 
we may be required to fund our us pension plans with contributions of up to million and our non us pension plans with contributions of up to million by the end of fiscal year  and we could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans 
during fiscal year  we made contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans outside the united states 
during fiscal year  we made a voluntary contribution of million for the plan year to our defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
during fiscal year  we also made contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans outside the united states 
we expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans 
effects of recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates 
such recently issued and adopted pronouncements did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows or do not apply to our operations 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  warranty costs  bad debts  inventories  accounting for business combinations and dispositions  long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may 
table of contents differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
for products that include installation  if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate element  we recognize product revenue upon delivery  and we delay recognition of installation revenue until the installation is complete 
for revenue that includes customer specified acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue only after the acceptance criteria have been met 
we defer revenue from services and recognize it over the contractual period  or as we render services 
in limited circumstances  we have arrangements that include multiple elements that are delivered at different points of time  such as revenue from products and services with a remaining service or storage component  such as cord blood processing and storage 
for these arrangements  the revenue is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling price hierarchy 
a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if such evidence is available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  and management s best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
tpe is the price of our or any competitor s largely interchangeable products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand alone basis  considering market conditions and entity specific factors 
revenue from software licenses and services is of our total revenue for fiscal year  of our total revenue for fiscal year  and of our total revenue for fiscal year we sell our software licenses with maintenance services and  in some cases  also with consulting services 
for the undelivered elements  we determine vsoe of fair value to be the price charged when the undelivered element is sold separately 
we determine vsoe for maintenance sold in connection with a software license based on the amount that will be separately charged for the maintenance renewal period 
we determine vsoe for consulting services by reference to the amount charged for similar engagements when a software license sale is not involved 
we recognize revenue from software licenses sold together with maintenance and or consulting services upon shipment using the residual method  provided that the above criteria have been met 
if vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements cannot be established  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until the earlier of the point at which such sufficient vsoe does exist or all elements of the arrangement have been delivered  or if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then we recognize the entire fee ratably over the maintenance period 
the majority of our sales relate to specific manufactured products or units rather than long term customized projects  therefore we generally do not experience significant changes in original estimates 
further  we have not experienced any significant refunds or promotional allowances that require significant estimation 
warranty costs 
we provide for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale 
warranty liabilities are based on estimated future repair costs using historical labor and material incurred in the warranty period 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we generally compute our allowance for doubtful accounts by i applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due and deemed uncollectible  and ii specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  we may have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would reduce our earnings 
inventory valuation 
we initially value inventory at actual cost to purchase and or manufacture 
we periodically review these values to ascertain that market value of the inventory continues to exceed its recorded cost 
generally  reductions in value of inventory below cost are caused by our maintenance of stocks of products in excess of demand  or technological obsolescence of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and  when necessary  record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on either our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements  or historical trailing usage of the product 
if our sales do not materialize as planned or at historic levels  we may have to increase our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
this would reduce our earnings 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower costs of sales and higher income from 
table of contents operations than expected in that period 
business combinations 
business combinations are accounted for at fair value 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  previously held equity interests are valued at fair value upon the acquisition of a controlling interest  in process research and development ipr d is recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business  and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets  in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including contingent consideration  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
value of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles 
we carry a variety of long lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment  investments  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
we periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based  in part  upon current estimated market values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows 
we undertake this review i on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets and ii on a periodic basis for other long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished 
any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings 
the goodwill impairment test consists of a two step process 
the first step is the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
the second step measures the amount of an impairment loss  and is only performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
we perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of january or the first day of each fiscal year 
this same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered 
non amortizing intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized 
in addition  we currently evaluate the remaining useful life of our non amortizing intangible assets at least annually to determine whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the useful lives of non amortizing intangible assets are no longer indefinite  the assets will be tested for impairment 
these intangible assets will then be amortized prospectively over their estimated remaining useful life and accounted for in the same manner as other intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
through fiscal year  we assessed the annual impairment testing for our reporting units analytical sciences and laboratory services  diagnostics  life sciences technology and medical imaging 
we completed the annual impairment test using a measurement date of january  and january   and concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment 
while we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could affect our evaluations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year we changed our method of recognizing defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
historically we recognized the actuarial gains and losses as a component of stockholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
these gains and losses were amortized into results of operations over the average future service period of the active employees  to the extent such gains and losses were outside of a corridor 
additionally  for our principal us defined benefit pension plan  we used a calculated value of plan assets reflecting changes in the fair value of plan assets over a five year period 
under our new method of accounting  we immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur 
this change is intended to recognize the effects of current economic and interest rate trends on plan investments and assumptions as they occur 
actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter  unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement 
additionally  we now use actual fair value of plan assets for the principal us defined benefit pension plan that had not previously utilized this method 
accordingly  the financial data for all periods presented has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the effect of these accounting changes 
we believe that the new policies are preferable as they eliminate the delay in the recognition of actuarial gains and losses  and changes to the fair value of plan assets 

table of contents retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business  and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future  and therefore are subject to estimation 
retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue  research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses  in our consolidated statements of operations 
we incurred expenses of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans  which includes the charge for the mark to market adjustment for the postretirement benefit plans  which generally is recorded in the fourth quarter 
the expense related to mark to market and curtailments on postretirement benefit plans was million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans  excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark to market adjustment 
it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a mark to market adjustment in fiscal year  and if one is required  the amount of such an adjustment 
mark to market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control  including changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets 
to the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease  mark to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year conversely  to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase  mark to market income will be recorded in fiscal year pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied  to determine service cost and interest cost  in order to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as of january   we estimated the expected long term rate of return on assets in our pension portfolios in the united states was and was for all plans outside the united states 
in addition  as of january  we estimated the discount rate for our pension portfolios in the united states was and was for all plans outside the united states 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where we invest the assets  as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension and other postretirement benefit assets 
our management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumptions for each plan based on relevant market conditions  and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
discount rate assumptions have been  and continue to be  based on the prevailing market long term interest rates at the measurement date 
if any of our assumptions were to change as of january   our pension plan expenses would also change 
increase decrease at january  percentage point change non us us pension plans discount rate rate of return on pension plan assets postretirement benefit plans discount rate n a n a rate of return on postretirement benefit plan assets n a n a we have reduced the volatility in our healthcare costs provided to our retirees by adopting a defined dollar plan feature in fiscal year under the defined dollar plan feature  our total annual liability for healthcare costs to any one retiree is limited to a fixed dollar amount  regardless of the nature or cost of the healthcare needs of that retiree 
our maximum future liability  therefore  cannot be increased by future changes in the cost of healthcare 
restructuring activities 
our consolidated financial statements detail specific charges relating to restructuring activities as well as the actual spending that has occurred against the resulting accruals 
our pre tax restructuring charges are estimates based on our preliminary assessments of i severance benefits to be granted to employees  based on known benefit formulas and identified job grades  ii costs to abandon certain facilities based on known lease costs of sub rental income and iii asset impairments as discussed above under value of long lived assets  including intangibles 
because these accruals are estimates  they are subject to change as a result of deviations from initial restructuring plans or subsequent information that may come to our attention 
for example  actual severance costs may be less than anticipated if employees voluntarily leave prior to the time at which they would be entitled to severance  or if anticipated legal hurdles in foreign jurisdictions prove to be less onerous 
table of contents than expected 
in addition  unanticipated successes or difficulties in terminating leases and other contractual obligations may lead to changes in estimates 
when such changes in estimates occur  they are reflected in our consolidated financial statements on our consolidated statements of operations line entitled restructuring and contract termination charges  net 
gains or losses on dispositions 
when we record the disposition of an asset or discontinuance of an operation  we make an estimate relative to the amount we expect to realize on the sale or disposition 
this estimate is based on a variety of factors  including current interest in the market  alternative markets for the assets  and other relevant factors 
if anticipated proceeds are less than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we record a loss 
if anticipated proceeds are greater than the current carrying amount of the asset or operation  we recognize a gain net of expected contingencies when the transaction has been consummated 
accordingly  we may realize amounts different than were first estimated 
during the fiscal year ended january   we recorded million in pre tax losses from disposition of fixed assets and million in pre tax gains from the disposition of discontinued operations 
any such changes decrease or increase current earnings 
income taxes 
our business operations are global in nature  and we are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions 
tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions  and are subject to change given the political and economic climate in those countries 
we report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law 
our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our current and deferred tax provisions 
any significant fluctuation in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change 
such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rate 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are operational decisions  transactions  facts and circumstances  and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is not certain 
furthermore  our tax positions are periodically subject to challenge by taxing authorities throughout the world 
every quarter we review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
adjustments are made to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change  causing a change in our judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts  law  tax rates  tax audit  or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense  our effective tax rate  or our cash flow 
additionally  we have established valuation allowances against a variety of deferred tax assets  including state net operating loss carryforwards  state income tax credit carryforwards  and certain foreign tax attributes 
valuation allowances take into consideration our ability to use these deferred tax assets and reduce the value of such items to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be recoverable 
improvements or other changes in our operations  domestically and internationally  could increase our ability to utilize these tax attributes in the future 
the release of valuation allowances in periods when these tax attributes become realizable would reduce our effective tax rate 
taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings that we continue to consider indefinitely reinvested  the determination of which is based on our future operational and capital requirements 
we continue to maintain our indefinite reinvestment assertion with regards to the remaining unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore do not accrue us tax for the repatriation of the remaining unremitted foreign earnings 
as of january   the amount of foreign earnings that we have the intent and ability to keep invested outside the us indefinitely and for which no us tax cost has been provided was approximately million 
it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments  marketable securities and accounts receivable 
we believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of january  we use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only  and include derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments 
by nature  all financial instruments involve market and credit risks 
we enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes  nor do we use leveraged financial instruments 
approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
therefore  the fluctuations in foreign currency can increase the costs of financing  investing and operating the business 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we may enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with our committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third party receivables and payables 
the contracts are primarily denominated in european and asian currencies  have maturities that do not exceed months  have no cash requirements until maturity  and are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
unrealized gains and losses on our foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in earnings for hedges designated as fair value and  for hedges designated as cash flow  the related unrealized gains or losses are deferred as a component of other comprehensive loss income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs and impacts earnings 
we did not have any outstanding cash flow hedges during fiscal years and principal hedged currencies include the british pound gbp  canadian dollar cad  euro eur  japanese yen jpy  and singapore dollar sgd 
we held forward foreign exchange contracts with us equivalent notional amounts totaling million at january  and million at january   and the approximate fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant 
the duration of these contracts was generally days or less during fiscal years   and in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
as of january   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
we amortized million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years   and market risk market risk 
we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures 
foreign exchange risk 
the potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us  as approximately of our business is conducted outside of the united states  generally in foreign currencies 
our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures 
the intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures  with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures 
moreover  we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the united states  material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the united states  resulting in natural hedges 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business  generally sales and net income will be positively but not proportionately impacted 
foreign currency risk value at risk disclosure 
we utilize a value at risk model to determine the potential earning fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments 
as discussed above  we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program 
our value at risk computation is based on the monte carlo simulation  utilizing a confidence interval and a holding period of days 
as of january   this computation estimated that there is a chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than million 
this value at risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program 
specifically  during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year  the value at risk ranged between million and million  with an average of approximately million 
interest rate risk 
as described above  our debt portfolio includes variable rate instruments 
fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short term cash flows  as they relate to interest  and our earnings 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures 

table of contents in may  we settled forward interest rate contracts with notional amounts totaling million upon the issuance of our notes  and recognized million  net of taxes of million  of accumulated derivative losses in other comprehensive income 
the derivative losses are being amortized into interest expense when the hedged exposure affects interest expense 
as of january   the balance remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the effective cash flow hedges was million  net of taxes of million 
we amortized million into interest expense during each of the fiscal years   and interest rate risk sensitivity 
as of january   our debt portfolio consisted of million of variable rate debt 
in addition  our cash and cash equivalents  for which we receive interest at variable rates  were million at january  our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows i changes in interest rates can cause interest charges on our variable rate debt  consisting of million of revolving debt facilities  to fluctuate 
an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause an additional pre tax charge to our earnings of million for fiscal year ii changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows relative to interest payments on variable rate debt to fluctuate 
as described above  an increase of  or approximately basis points  in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by million for fiscal year iii changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate
