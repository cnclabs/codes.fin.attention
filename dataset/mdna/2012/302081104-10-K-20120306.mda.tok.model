table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a limited number of clients and provide services to few industries 
in  approximately of our total revenues came from three clients 
we have derived and believe that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our total revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in  our three largest clients travelers  centrica and american express  accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
we generated of our total revenues in from travelers  of our total revenues in from centrica and of our total revenues in from american express 
we provide services to travelers under a services agreement and work assignments and orders generated thereunder 
although the services agreement does not have a fixed term  the work assignments and work orders expire in december and renew every year thereafter unless either party elects not to renew within a specified period before the next renewal date 
travelers may terminate the services agreement  or any work assignment or work order  without cause upon days prior notice 
we provide services to centrica under an agreement that expires in april centrica will have the option to extend the contract for two annual extension periods 
this contract can be terminated by centrica without cause upon three months prior notice and payment of a breakup fee 
we provide services to american express under a separate agreement for each of our bpo services and our transformation services 
the agreement for transformation services can be terminated by american express without cause upon five days prior written notice 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients in the near future 
the loss or financial difficulties of either of our large clients would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
general economic and business conditions could negatively affect our business in multiple ways 
the recent global economic downturn adversely impacted companies in the industries to which we provide services  including the banking  financial services and insurance industries 
in  approximately of our total revenues were derived from clients in those industries  including of our total revenues that were derived from clients in the insurance industry 
our business largely depends on continued demand for our services from clients and potential clients in these industries 
adverse developments in these industries or the other select industries to which we provide services could further unfavorably affect our business 
in particular  we currently derive  and are likely to continue to derive  a significant portion of our revenues from clients located in the us any future decreases in the general level of economic activity  such as decreases in business and consumer spending  could result in a decrease in demand for our services  particularly our transformation services  thus reducing our revenue 
continued high unemployment rates in the us could also adversely affect the demand for our services 
other developments in response to economic events  such as consolidations  restructurings or reorganizations  particularly involving our clients  could also cause the demand for our services to decline 
any future disruptions in the commercial credit markets may impact liquidity in the global credit market as greatly  or even more  than in recent years  and we may not be able to predict the impact such worsening conditions will have on our targeted industries in general  and our results of operations specifically 
future turbulence in global markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and the liquidity and financial condition of our clients  and they may limit our ability to access financing or increase our cost of financing to meet liquidity needs  and affect the ability of our customers to use credit to purchase our services or to make timely payments to us  resulting in adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in global economic conditions could also shift demand to services for which we do not have competitive advantages  and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain 
our industry may not develop in ways that we currently anticipate due to negative public reaction in the us and elsewhere to offshore outsourcing  recently proposed legislation or otherwise 
we have based our strategy of future growth on certain assumptions regarding our industry and future developments in the market for outsourcing services 
for example  we believe that there will continue to be 
table of contents changes in product and service requirements  and investments in the products offered by our clients will continue to increase 
however  the trend to outsource business processes may not continue and could reverse 
offshore outsourcing is a politically sensitive topic in the us and elsewhere  and many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore outsourcing providers and the loss of jobs in the us and elsewhere 
in addition  there has been limited publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that use offshore outsourcing  particularly in india 
current or prospective clients may elect to perform such services themselves or may be discouraged from transferring these services to offshore providers to avoid any negative perception that may be associated with using an offshore provider 
any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends would harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that operate out of facilities located in the us and elsewhere 
a variety of us federal and state legislation has been proposed that  if enacted  could restrict or discourage us companies from outsourcing their services to companies outside the us for example  legislation has been proposed that would require offshore providers to identify where they are located and that would require notice to individuals whose personal information is disclosed to non us companies 
in addition  recently introduced bills have proposed providing tax and other economic incentives for companies that create employment in the us by reducing their offshore outsourcing 
other bills have proposed requiring call centers to disclose their geographic locations  requiring notice to individuals whose personal information is disclosed to non us affiliates or subcontractors  requiring disclosures of companies foreign outsourcing practices or restricting us private sector companies that have federal government contracts  federal grants or guaranteed loan programs from outsourcing their services to offshore service providers 
because most of our clients are located in the us  any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing could adversely impact our ability to do business with us clients and have a material and adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
in other countries  such as the uk  which comprised of our total revenues in  there has also been some negative publicity and concern expressed regarding the possible effect of job losses caused by outsourcing 
legislation enacted in the uk provides that if a company transfers or outsources its business or a part of its business to a transferee or a service provider  the employees who were employed in such business are entitled to become employed by the transferee or service provider on the same terms and conditions as they had been employed before the transfer 
the dismissal of such employees as a result of such transfer of business is deemed unfair dismissal and entitles the employees to compensation 
as a result  we may become liable for redundancy payments to the employees of our clients in the uk who outsource business to us 
we are generally indemnified in our existing contracts with clients in the uk to the extent we incur losses or additional costs due to the application of this legislation to us  and we intend to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients 
however  if we are unable to obtain indemnification in future contracts with clients  we may be liable under any agreements we enter into in the future with uk clients 
similar legislation has also been enacted in certain other european jurisdictions 
our client contracts contain certain termination and other provisions that could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
most of our client contracts may be terminated by our clients without cause and do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
any failure to meet a client s expectations could result in a cancellation or non renewal of a contract or a decrease in business provided to us 
we may not be able to replace any client that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us  which would reduce our revenues 
for example  we provide services to travelers under a services agreement that travelers may terminate without cause upon days prior notice  we provide services to centrica under an agreement that can be terminated by centrica without cause upon three months prior notice and payment of a breakup fee and we provide transformation services to american express under an agreement that can be terminated by american express without cause upon five days prior written notice 
we generated of our total revenues in from travelers  of our total revenues in from centrica and of our total revenues in from american express 
the termination of any of these contracts with or without cause could have a material adverse impact on the predictability of our expected revenue stream 

table of contents a limited number of our contracts allow a client  in certain limited circumstances  to request a benchmark study comparing our pricing and performance with that of an agreed list of other service providers for comparable services 
based on the results of the study and depending on the reasons for any unfavorable variance  we may be required to make improvements in the services we provide or reduce the pricing for services on a prospective basis to be performed under the remaining term of the contract or our client could elect to terminate the contract  which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many of our contracts contain provisions that would require us to pay penalties to our clients and or provide our clients with the right to terminate the contract if we do not meet pre agreed service level requirements or if we do not provide certain productivity benefits 
failure to meet these requirements or accurately estimate the productivity benefits could result in the payment of significant penalties by us to our clients which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
some of our contracts with clients specify that if a change of control of our company occurs during the term of the contract  the client has the right to terminate the contract 
these provisions may result in our contracts being terminated if there is such a change in control  resulting in a potential loss of revenues 
in addition  these provisions may act as a deterrent to any attempt by a third party to acquire our company 
we may fail to attract and retain enough sufficiently trained employees to support our operations  as competition for highly skilled personnel is intense and we experience significant employee turnover rates 
the bpo industry is very labor intensive and our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to attract  hire  train and retain qualified employees  including our ability to attract employees with needed skills in the geographic areas in which we operate 
the industry  including us  experiences high employee turnover 
in  our turnover rate for billable employees was approximately 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
increased competition for these professionals  in the bpo industry or otherwise  could have an adverse effect on us 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to provide bpo services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins  and could lead to a decline in demand for our services 
high turnover rates generally do not impact our revenues as we factor the attrition rate into our pricing models by maintaining additional employees for each process 
however  high turnover rates do increase our cost of revenues and therefore impact our profit margins due to higher recruitment  training and retention costs as a result of maintaining larger hiring  training and human resources departments and higher operating costs due to having to reallocate certain business processes among our operations centers where we have access to the skilled workforce needed for the business 
in  we incurred approximately million on recruitment and approximately million on training costs due to employee turnover  thereby increasing our costs and reducing our profit margins for that period by million 
in addition  our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business will depend  in large part  on our ability to attract  train and retain personnel with skills that keep pace with the demand for outsourcing  evolving industry standards and changing client preferences 
a lack of sufficiently qualified personnel could also inhibit our ability to establish operations in new markets and our efforts to expand geographically 
our failure to attract  train and retain personnel with the qualifications necessary to fulfill the needs of our existing and future clients or to assimilate new employees successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments 
we have a long selling cycle for our bpo services  which requires significant investment of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services  including testing our services for a limited period of time  and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
our clients then evaluate our services before deciding whether to use them 
therefore  our selling cycle  
table of contents which generally ranges from six to eighteen months  is subject to many risks and delays over which we have little or no control  including our clients decision to choose alternatives to our services such as other providers or in house offshore resources and the timing of our clients budget cycles and approval processes 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully conclude a contract after the selling cycle is complete 
implementing our services involves a significant commitment of resources over an extended period of time from both our clients and us 
our clients may also experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations  thereby delaying further the implementation process 
our clients and future clients may not be willing or able to invest the time and resources necessary to implement our services  and we may fail to close sales with potential clients to which we have devoted significant time and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
once we are engaged by a client  it may take us several months before we start to recognize significant revenues 
when we are engaged by a client after the selling process for our bpo services  it takes from four to six weeks to integrate the client s systems with ours  and up to three months thereafter to build up our services to the client s requirements 
depending on the complexity of the processes being implemented  these time periods may be significantly longer 
implementing processes can be subject to potential delays similar to certain of those affecting the selling cycle 
therefore  we do not recognize significant revenues until after we have completed the implementation phase 
we enter into long term contracts with our bpo clients  and our failure to estimate the resources and time required for our contracts may negatively affect our profitability 
the initial terms of our bpo client contracts typically range from three to five years 
in many of our bpo contracts we commit to long term pricing with our clients and therefore bear the risk of cost overruns  completion delays  wage inflation and adverse movements in exchange rates in connection with these contracts 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources and time required for a contract  future wage inflation rates or currency exchange rates or fail to accurately hedge our currency exchange rate exposure or if we fail to complete our contractual obligations within the contracted timeframe  our revenues and profitability may be negatively affected 
consistency in our revenues from period to period depends in part on our ability to reflect the changing demands and needs of our existing and potential bpo clients 
if we are unable to adjust our pricing terms or the mix of products and services we provide to meet the changing demands of our bpo clients and potential bpo clients  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
most of our bpo contracts use a pricing model that provides for hourly or annual billing rates 
industry pricing models are evolving  however  and we anticipate that clients may increasingly request transaction based or other pricing models 
if we are unable to obtain operating efficiencies or if we make inaccurate assumptions for contacts with transaction based pricing  our profitability may be negatively affected 
if we are unable to adapt our operations to evolving pricing protocols  our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to offer pricing that is attractive relative to our competitors 
in addition  the bpo services we provide to our clients and the revenues and income from those services may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts changes over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
furthermore  our clients  some of which have experienced significant and adverse changes in their prospects  substantial price competition and pressures on their profitability  have in the past and may in the future demand price reductions  automate some or all of their processes or change their outsourcing strategy by moving more work in house or to other providers  any of which could reduce our profitability 
any significant reduction in or the elimination of the use of the services we provide to any of our clients  or any requirement to lower our prices  would harm our business 

table of contents our profitability will suffer if we are not able to appropriately price our services or manage our asset utilization levels 
our profitability is largely a function of the efficiency with which we utilize our assets  and in particular our people and our operations centers  and the pricing that we are able to obtain for our services 
our asset utilization levels are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to transition employees from completed projects to new assignments  attract  train and retain employees  forecast demand for our services and maintain an appropriate headcount in each of our locations  as well as our need to dedicate resources to employee training and development and other typically non chargeable activities 
the prices we are able to charge for our services are affected by a number of factors  including our clients perceptions of our ability to add value through our services  substantial price competition  introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors  our ability to accurately estimate  attain and sustain revenues from client engagements  our ability to estimate resources for long term pricing  margins and cash flows for long term contracts and general economic and political conditions 
therefore  if we are unable to appropriately price our services or manage our asset utilization levels  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our transformation services are cyclical and based on specific projects involving short term contracts 
our transformation services  such as our decision analytics  finance transformation and operations and process excellence services  are cyclical and can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
changes in the deadlines or the scope of work required for compliance with the requirements of legislation applicable to our clients could have a significant impact on certain service offerings of our finance transformation services business 
in addition  a majority of our transformation services consist of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
our operating results may experience significant variability and as a result it may be difficult for us to make accurate financial forecasts 
our operating results may vary significantly from period to period 
although our existing agreements with original terms of three or more years provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
the timing of revenue recognition under new client agreements also varies depending on when we complete the implementation phase 
the completion of implementation varies significantly based upon the complexity of the processes being implemented 
our period to period results have in the past and may also in the future fluctuate due to other factors  including client losses  delays or failure by our clients to provide anticipated business  variations in employee utilization rates resulting from changes in our clients operations  delays or difficulties in expanding our operations centers and infrastructure including hiring new employees or constructing new operations centers  changes to our pricing structure or that of our competitors  currency fluctuation  seasonal changes in the operations of our clients and other events identified in this annual report on form k 
our revenues are also affected by changes in pricing under our contracts at the time of renewal or by pricing under new contracts 
for example  because the majority of our revenues are denominated in uk pounds sterling or uk dollars while most of our expenses are incurred and paid in indian rupees and the philippine peso  our revenues can decrease or increase significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar fluctuate significantly 
in addition  most of our contracts do not commit our clients to provide us with a specific volume of business 
these factors may make it difficult to make accurate financial forecasts or replace anticipated revenues that we do not receive as a result of delays in implementing our services or client losses 
if our actual results do not meet any estimated results that we announce  or if we underperform market expectations as a result of such factors  trading prices for our common stock could be adversely affected 

table of contents our senior management team is critical to our continued success and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could harm our business 
our future success substantially depends on the continued services and performance of the members of our management team and other key employees possessing technical and business capabilities  including industry expertise  that are difficult to replace 
specifically  the loss of the services of rohit kapoor  our president and chief executive officer  could seriously impair our ability to continue to manage and expand our business 
there is intense competition for experienced senior management and personnel with technical and industry expertise in the industry in which we operate  and we may not be able to retain these officers or key employees 
although we have entered into employment and non competition agreements with all of our executive officers  certain terms of those agreements may not be enforceable and in any event these agreements do not ensure the continued service of these executive officers 
mr 
kapoor and certain of his affiliates have certain registration rights with respect to their shares of common stock 
in addition  we currently do not maintain key person insurance covering any member of our management team 
the loss of any of our key employees  particularly to competitors  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our inability to effectively manage our rapid infrastructure and personnel growth could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations and financial condition 
since we were founded in april  we have experienced rapid growth and significantly expanded our operations 
we have fifteen operations centers in india  five operations centers in the us  two operations centers in bulgaria and one in each of the philippines  romania  the czech republic and malaysia 
our headcount has increased from approximately  on december  to approximately  on december  we expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations where we operate in order to address the anticipated growth of our business 
we inaugurated a new operations center in the philippines in january and are in the process of expanding some of our operations centers in india 
we are also continuing to look for operations centers at additional locations outside of our current operating geographies 
we believe expanding our geographic base of operations will provide higher value to our clients by decreasing the risks of operating from a single country including potential shortages of skilled employees  increases in wage costs during strong economic times and currency fluctuations  while also giving our clients access to a wider talent pool and establishing a base in countries that may be competitive in the future 
however  we may not be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and employee expansion  open additional operations centers or hire additional skilled employees as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our clients  and we may not be able to develop and improve our internal systems 
our inability to execute our growth strategy  to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may engage in strategic acquisitions or transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to selectively consider acquisitions or investments  some of which may be material 
through the acquisitions we pursue  we may seek opportunities to expand the scope of our existing services we provide  add new clients or to enter new geographic markets 
we have made acquisitions in the past  including our acquisitions in of the american express global travel services center located in gurgaon  india and pdma  developer of the lifepro insurance policy administration platform  and our acquisitions in of opi and trumbull 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable candidates in the future for strategic transactions at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to finance potential acquisitions or be able to consummate any desired transactions 
our failure to close transactions with potential acquisition targets for which we have invested significant time and resources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows 
acquisitions  including completed acquisitions  involve a number of risks  including diversion of management s attention  ability to finance the acquisition on attractive terms  failure to retain key personnel or 
table of contents valuable customers  legal liabilities and the need to amortize acquired intangible assets  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
future acquisitions may also result in the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance of additional equity securities 
we could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems  including problems related to execution  integration or underperformance relative to prior expectations 
our management may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business into our operations or maintain our standards  controls and policies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
consequently  any acquisition we do complete may not result in long term benefits to us 
following the completion of an acquisition  we may have to rely on the seller to provide administrative and other support  including financial reporting and internal controls  and other transition services to the acquired business for a period of time 
there can be no assurance that the seller will do so in a manner that is acceptable to us 
employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
our most significant costs are the salaries and related benefits of our operations staff and other employees 
for example  wage costs in india have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the us and europe for comparably skilled professionals  which has been one of our competitive advantages 
however  because of rapid economic growth in india  increased demand for bpo services from india and increased competition for skilled employees in india  wages for comparably skilled employees in india are increasing at a faster rate than in the us and europe  which may reduce this competitive advantage 
we may need to increase the levels of employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive in attracting and retaining the quality and number of employees that our business requires 
wages are generally higher for employees performing transformation services than for employees performing bpo services 
as the scale of our transformation services increases  wages as a percentage of revenues will likely increase 
to the extent that we are not able to control or share wage increases with our clients  wage increases may reduce our margins 
we will attempt to control such costs by our efforts to add capacity in locations where we consider wage levels of skilled personnel to be satisfactory  but we may not be successful in doing so 
additionally  because a majority of our employees are based in india and paid in indian rupees  while our revenues are primarily in us dollars and uk pounds sterling  our employee costs as a percentage of revenues may increase or decrease significantly if the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling and the uk dollar fluctuate significantly 
if more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if our employees unionize  our profitability may be adversely affected 
india has stringent labor legislation that protects employee interests  including legislation that sets forth detailed procedures for dispute resolution and employee removal and legislation that imposes financial obligations on employers upon retrenchment 
though we are exempt from some of these labor laws at present under exceptions in some states for providers of it enabled services  there can be no assurance that such laws will not become applicable to us in the future 
if these labor laws become applicable to our employees  it may become difficult for us to maintain flexible human resource policies and attract and employ the numbers of sufficiently qualified candidates that we need or discharge employees  and our compensation expenses may increase significantly 
in addition  our employees may in the future form unions 
if employees at any of our operations centers become eligible for union membership  we may be required to raise wage levels or grant other benefits that could result in an increase in our compensation expenses  in which case our profitability may be adversely affected 
the government of india has recently focused on the occupational health and safety concerns experienced by workers in the outsourcing industry 
the introduction of legislation imposing restrictions on working hours or conditions of professionals in the outsourcing industry could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we face significant competition from us based and us based outsourcing and information technology companies and from our clients  who may perform outsourcing services themselves  either in house  in the us or through offshore groups or other arrangements 
the market for outsourcing services is highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify and increase from a number of sources 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are breadth and depth of process expertise  knowledge of industries served  service quality  the ability to attract  train and retain qualified people  compliance rigor  global delivery capabilities  price and sales and client management capabilities 
we also face competition from non us based outsourcing and it companies including those in the uk and india and uk based outsourcing and it companies 
in addition  the trend toward offshore outsourcing  international expansion by foreign and domestic competitors and continuing technological changes  such as cloud computing  will result in new and different competition for our services 
these competitors may include entrants from the communications  software and data networking industries or entrants in geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate 
some of these existing and future competitors have greater financial  personnel and other resources  a broader range of service offerings  greater technological expertise  more recognizable brand names and more established relationships in industries that we currently serve or may serve in the future 
in addition  some of our competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger  more established companies in order to increase their ability to address client needs  or enter into similar arrangements with potential clients 
the trend in multi vendor relationships has been growing  which could reduce our revenues to the extent that we are required to modify the terms of our relationship with clients or that clients obtain services from other vendors 
increased competition  our inability to compete successfully against competitors  pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in reduced operating margins  which could harm our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we expect competition to intensify in the future as more companies enter our markets 
increased competition may result in lower prices and volumes  higher costs for resources  especially people  and lower profitability 
we may not be able to supply clients with services that they deem superior and at competitive prices and we may lose business to our competitors 
any inability to compete effectively would adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may disrupt our clients operations as a result of inadequate service or other factors  including telecommunications or technology downtime or interruptions 
the services we provide are often critical to our clients businesses  and any failure to provide those services could result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure 
most of our agreements with clients contain service level and performance requirements  including requirements relating to the quality of our services 
failure to consistently meet service requirements of a client or errors made by our employees in the course of delivering services to our clients could disrupt the client s business and result in a reduction in revenues or a claim for damages against us 
additionally  we could incur certain liabilities if a process we manage for a client were to result in internal control failures or impair our client s ability to comply with its own internal control requirements 
under a majority of our agreements with our clients  our liability for breach of certain of our obligations is generally limited to actual damages suffered by the client and is typically capped at the greater of an agreed amount or the fees paid or payable to us for a period of time under the relevant agreement 
these limitations and caps on liability may be unenforceable or otherwise may not protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients or liability for breaches of confidentiality  are generally not limited under those agreements 
our agreements are governed by laws of multiple jurisdictions  therefore the interpretation of such provisions  and the availability of defenses to us  may vary  which may contribute to the uncertainty as to the scope of our potential liability 
our dependence on our offshore operations centers requires us to maintain active voice and data communications among our operations centers  our international technology hubs and our clients offices 

table of contents although we maintain redundant facilities and communications links  disruptions could result from  among other things  technical breakdowns  computer glitches and viruses and weather conditions 
we also depend on certain significant vendors for facility storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data at those technology hubs 
any failure by these vendors to perform those services  any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems  or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our clients  have a negative impact on our reputation  cause us to lose clients  reduce our revenues and harm our business 
our business could be materially and adversely affected if we do not protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe on the intellectual property of others 
our success depends in part on certain methodologies  practices  tools and technical expertise we utilize in designing  developing  implementing and maintaining applications and other proprietary intellectual property rights 
in order to protect our rights in these various intellectual properties  we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements as well as trade secret  copyright and trademark laws 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  clients and potential clients and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
we also have submitted and expect to continue to submit us federal and foreign trademark applications for the names of certain service offerings 
we may not be successful in maintaining or obtaining trademarks for these trade names 
india is a member of the berne convention  an international intellectual property treaty  and has agreed to recognize protections on intellectual property rights conferred under the laws of other foreign countries  including the laws of the us there can be no assurance that the laws  rules  regulations and treaties in effect in the us  india and the other jurisdictions in which we operate and the contractual and other protective measures we take  are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property  or that such laws will not change 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights  and any such steps may not be successful 
infringement by others of our intellectual property  including the costs of enforcing our intellectual property rights  may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our client contracts generally require our clients to indemnify us for any breaches of intellectual property or licenses to third party software when our clients provide such access to us 
although we believe that we are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others  claims may nonetheless be asserted against us in the future 
the costs of defending any such claims could be significant  and any successful claim may require us to modify  discontinue or rename any of our services 
any such changes may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data  whether through breach of our computer systems or otherwise  could expose us to protracted and costly litigation and cause us to lose clients 
we are typically required to collect and store sensitive data in connection with our services  including names  addresses  social security numbers  personal health information  credit card account numbers  checking and savings account numbers and payment history records  such as account closures and returned checks 
as a result  we are subject to various data protection and privacy laws in countries in which we operate 
in addition  many of our agreements with our clients do not include any limitation on our liability to them with respect to breaches of our obligation to keep the information we receive from them confidential 
we devote substantial resources to maintaining adequate levels of cybersecurity and to protecting confidential client and customer data 
however  any network infrastructure may be vulnerable to rapidly evolving cyber attacks 
if any person  including any of our employees  penetrates our network security or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates sensitive data  we could be subject to significant liability and lawsuits from our clients or their own customers for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws 
we have obtained privacy and network security insurance for claims related to breaches of our privacy and network security  including unauthorized access to or disclosure of sensitive data  suspension or interruption of our network infrastructure  transmission of computer viruses or failure to comply with our privacy and network security procedures 
however  such coverage may not 
table of contents be adequate or may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claims 
cyber attacks penetrating the network security of our data centers could also have a negative impact on our reputation and client confidence  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we may not be fully insured for all losses we may incur 
although we attempt to limit and mitigate our liability for damages arising from negligent acts  errors or omissions through contractual provisions  limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable in all instances or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
in addition  certain liabilities  such as claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients  are generally not limited under those agreements 
although we have general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions  property damage or loss and breaches of privacy and network security  that coverage may not continue to be available on reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims  and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage  or changes in our insurance policies including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co insurance requirements  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
oak hill capital partners  l 
p and certain of its affiliates and rohit kapoor exercise significant influence over us  and their interests in our business may be different than yours 
a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock are currently beneficially owned by oak hill capital partners  lp oak hill and certain of its affiliates and our president and chief executive officer  rohit kapoor 
as of december   oak hill and certain of its affiliates beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock  and mr 
kapoor and certain trusts for his benefit and that of his family collectively beneficially owned  shares or of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  each of these parties can exercise significant influence over our business policies and affairs and all matters requiring a stockholders vote  including the composition of our board of directors  the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and the approval of mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets 
this concentration of ownership also may delay  defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders 
the interests of these stockholders may conflict with your interests 
we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future  and  because we are a holding company  we may be unable to pay dividends 
for the foreseeable future  we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent on then existing conditions  including our financial condition and results of operations  capital requirements  contractual restrictions  including restrictions under our credit agreement  business prospects and other factors that our board of directors considers relevant 
furthermore  because we are a holding company  any dividend payments would depend on the cash flow of our subsidiaries 
accordingly  we may not be able to pay dividends even if our board of directors would otherwise deem it appropriate 
we may choose to expand operations to additional countries and may not be successful in maintaining our current profit margins in our new locations due to factors beyond our control 
we are currently continuing to evaluate additional locations outside our current operating geographies in which to invest in an operations center 
we cannot predict the extent of government support  availability of qualified workers  or monetary and economic conditions in other countries 
although some of these factors will influence our decision to establish operations in another country  there are inherent risks beyond our control  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political uncertainties  foreign exchange restrictions and foreign 
table of contents regulatory restrictions 
one or more of these factors or other factors relating to expanded international operations could result in increased operating expenses and make it more difficult for us to manage our costs and operations  which could harm our business and negatively impact our operating results 
we may increase the range of services that we provide to our clients and our business and future prospects are difficult to evaluate 
we are exploring opportunities to provide services that we have not provided to date 
should we decide to expand our service offerings  our results of operations may be negatively affected during any transition or growth period before such offerings achieve profitability 
for example  we may need to expand our training of our existing employees or recruit new  specially trained employees to provide these services  which could increase our costs of revenues disproportionately to the revenues generated by such services 
other challenges we may face include the diversion of our management s attention  attracting and retaining clients for such services  integrating any new services into our current suite of services and managing any resulting growth in our operations 
failure to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on our operations 
our clients are often subject to regulations that may require that we comply with certain rules and regulations in performing services for them that would not otherwise apply to us 
debt collection services  for example  may be subject to the fair debt collection practices act  which regulates debt collection practices 
in addition  many us states require a debt collector to apply for  be granted and maintain a license to engage in debt collection activities in a state 
we are currently licensed or exempt from licensing requirements to provide debt collection services in the us from india in all but two us states and from the philippines in us states that have non exempt requirements and have separate conditional exemptions with respect to our ongoing collection obligations 
if we do not maintain our licenses or other qualifications to provide our services  we may not be able to provide services to existing customers or be able to attract new clients and could lose revenues  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other us federal laws and regulations that apply to certain portions of our business include the fair credit reporting act  the gramm leach bliley act  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  the hitech act of  the truth in lending act  the fair credit billing act and fdic rules and regulations 
we must also comply with applicable regulations relating to healthcare and other personal information that we must process as part of our services 
our agreements with some of our clients require us to remain knowledgeable about and comply with a number of relevant consumer protection laws and other regulatory requirements 
failure to perform our services in a manner that complies with any such requirement could result in breaches of contracts with our clients 
our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil fines and criminal penalties 
risks related to the international nature of our business our financial condition could be negatively affected if foreign governments reduce or withdraw tax benefits and other incentives currently provided to companies within our industry  or if the same are not available for other reasons 
under the income tax act  of india  we previously benefited from certain tax incentives promulgated by the indian government  including a tax holiday from indian corporate income taxes for the operation of some of our indian operations centers 
the tax benefit for most of our operations centers in india expired on april  our operations centers in jaipur and noida  which were established in sezs in  are eligible for tax incentives until as part of the opi acquisition  we also acquired operations centers in bengaluru and kochi  india that are also established in sezs 
the operations center in bengaluru will complete its first five years of operations on march  under the tax regulations  the bengaluru operations center will be entitled to a tax exemption on profits from april   after which there will be an increase in the tax expense for such center 
we anticipate establishing additional operations centers in sezs in the future 

table of contents the direct taxes code bill the direct taxes code proposed by the government of india and currently pending before the indian parliament proposes grandfathering the existing profit based tax benefits for operations centers in sezs already receiving such tax benefits 
the direct taxes code also proposes discontinuing profit based incentives for operations centers in sezs set up after march  and replaces them with investment based incentives for operations centers in sezs established after that date 
accordingly  we expect to continue receiving the benefit of tax deductions for our existing operations centers in sezs pursuant to the current regulations until the currently proposed march  sunset date 
if this grandfathering does not happen under the direct taxes code and if the sunset date is brought forward  our new operations centers in sezs will not receive profit based tax benefits 
without such benefits  we expect that our tax rate in india and our overall tax rate will increase over the next few years and that such increase may be material 
we currently benefit from a four year income tax holiday for one of our operations centers in the philippines that will expire in the middle of but is extendable for an additional two years 
our new operations center in the philippines  inaugurated in january  will also benefit from a four year income tax holiday that is extendable for an additional two years 
while we intend to apply for extensions of these holidays when they expire  it is possible that such extensions could be denied  or these holidays could be removed entirely due to changes in the government of the philippines 
should either of these events occur  our philippine tax liability could increase 
we may be required to pay additional taxes in connection with audits by the indian taxing authorities 
us and indian transfer pricing regulations require that any international transaction involving associated enterprises be at an arm s length price 
transactions among the company s subsidiaries and the company may be required to satisfy such requirements 
accordingly  the company determines the pricing among its associated enterprises on the basis of detailed functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not under common control 
the tax authorities have jurisdiction to review this arrangement and in the event that they determine that the transfer price applied was not appropriate  the company may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties 
the company is currently involved in disputes with the indian tax authorities over the application of some of its transfer pricing policies for past years 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for details 
based on advice from our indian tax advisors  the facts underlying our position and our experience with these types of assessments  we continue to believe that the probability of loss is remote and have not accrued any amount with respect to these matters in our consolidated financial statements 
any amounts paid by us as deposits will be refunded to us with interest or applied toward outstanding disputes at such time if we succeed in our appeals with the appropriate tax authorities 
we cannot assure you that our appeals will be successful or that these appeals will be finally resolved in the near future 
introduction of tax legislation and disputes with tax authorities may have an adverse effect on our operations and our overall tax rate 
governments in countries in which we operate or provide services could enact new tax legislation which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  our ability to repatriate surplus earnings from our operations centers in a tax efficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local laws  possible changes in such laws and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties 
changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  if a tax authority in any jurisdiction reviews any of our tax returns and determines that the transfer prices and terms we have applied are not appropriate  or that other income of our affiliates should be taxed in that jurisdiction  we may incur increased tax liability  including accrued interest and penalties  which would cause our tax expense to increase  possibly materially  thereby reducing our profitability and cash flows 

table of contents currency fluctuations among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although a substantial portion of our revenues are denominated in uk pounds sterling in or us dollars in  most of our expenses in are incurred and paid in indian rupees 
we report our financial results in us dollars 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling  the philippine peso and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
although we take steps to hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar foreign currency exposures  our results of operations may be adversely affected if the indian rupee fluctuates significantly against the uk pound sterling or the us dollar  the us pound sterling further depreciates against the us dollar  our hedging strategy is unsuccessful or if the hedging markets have insufficient liquidity or depth to allow us to implement our hedging strategy in a cost effective manner 
any failure by our hedging counterparties to meet their contractual obligations could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we are subject to legal restrictions on hedging activities as well as the convertibility of currencies in india 
this could limit our ability to use cash generated in one country in another country and could limit our ability to hedge our exposures 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence involving india  the philippines  the us or other countries could adversely affect the financial markets  result in a loss of client confidence and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war  including those involving india  the philippines  the us or other countries  may adversely affect worldwide financial markets and could potentially lead to economic recession  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these events could adversely affect our clients levels of business activity and precipitate sudden significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles 
these events also pose significant risks to our people and to our operations centers 
south asia has  from time to time  experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  including bangladesh  pakistan and china 
in recent years there have been several instances of military confrontations along the indo pakistani border 
there continues to be potential for hostilities between india and pakistan due to recent terrorist activities and the geopolitical climate along the border 
although this has not been the case to date  such political tensions could create a perception that there is a risk of disruption of services provided by india based companies  which could have a material adverse effect on the market for our services 
furthermore  if india were to become engaged in armed hostilities  particularly hostilities that were protracted or involved the threat or use of nuclear weapons  we might not be able to continue to operate 
our insurance policies may not insure us against losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war 
we may face difficulties as we expand our operations into countries in which we have no prior operating experience 
we intend to continue to expand our global footprint in order to maintain an appropriate cost structure and meet our clients delivery needs 
this may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate 
it may involve expanding into less developed countries  which may have less political  social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems 
as we expand our business into new countries we may encounter regulatory  personnel  technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses or delay our ability to start up our operations or become profitable in such countries 
this may affect our relationships with our clients and could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a substantial portion of our assets and operations are located in india  and we are subject to regulatory  economic and political uncertainties in india 
our principal operating subsidiaries are incorporated in india  and a majority of our assets and our professionals are located in india

in 
table of contents the early s  india experienced significant inflation  low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of foreign currency reserves 
the indian government  however  has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the indian economy 
india s government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy  including the bpo industry 
certain of those programs  which have benefited us  include tax holidays  liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation 
we cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue 
various factors  such as changes in the current federal government  could trigger significant changes in india s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in india generally and our business in particular 
the choice of india as an outsourcing destination and our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in india  including changes in exchange rates and controls  interest rates and taxation policies  as well as social stability and political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
in particular  india has experienced significant economic growth over the last several years  but faces major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead 
these challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education 
our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  develop and operate our operations centers  and attract and retain clients could be adversely affected if india does not successfully meet these challenges 
the philippines periodically experiences political or economic instability  which could disrupt our operations  increase our costs and harm our business 
the philippines has experienced significant inflation  currency declines and shortages of foreign exchange 
we are exposed to the risk of cost increases due to inflation in the philippines  which has historically been at a much higher rate than in the us these conditions could create political or economic instability that could harm businesses operating in the philippines 
in addition  the philippines has experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest  terrorism and political turmoil  resulting in temporary work stoppages and telecommunication or other technology outages 
these instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment in the philippines could increase our operational costs  increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in the philippines 
restrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to clients in the us  which could have a material adverse effect on future revenues 
the vast majority of our employees are indian nationals 
the ability of some of our executives and employees to work with and meet our us and european clients and our clients from other countries depends on their ability to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits 
in response to terrorist attacks  the global economic downturn and public sentiments about the high unemployment rates in their respective economies  us and european immigration authorities have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas 
immigration laws in those countries may also require us to meet certain levels of compensation and comply with other legal requirements as a condition to obtaining or maintaining entry visas 
these restrictions have increased the application fees for certain types of visas and have significantly lengthened the time requirements to obtain visas for our personnel  which has in the past resulted  and may continue to result  in delays in the ability of our personnel to meet with our clients 
in addition  immigration laws are subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement due to political forces  economic conditions or other events  including terrorist attacks 
we cannot predict the political or economic events that could affect immigration laws or any restrictive impact those events could have on obtaining or monitoring entry visas for our professionals 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary visas for personnel who need to get to our clients sites  or if the duration of such visas is shortened or if such visas are delayed  we may not be able to provide services to our clients or to continue to provide these services on a timely and cost effective basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 

table of contents an outbreak of an infectious disease or any other serious public health concerns in asia or elsewhere could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
the outbreak of an infectious disease in asia or elsewhere or any other serious public health concerns could have a negative impact on the economies  financial markets and business activities in the countries in which our end markets are located  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
past outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome  avian influenza  or bird flu  or hn across asia and europe have adversely affected a number of countries and companies 
although we have not been adversely impacted by these recent outbreaks  we can give no assurance that a future outbreak of an infectious disease among humans or animals or any other serious public health concerns will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are vulnerable to natural disasters that could severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely affect our business  results of operation and financial condition 
india and the philippines are susceptible to natural disasters  including typhoons  tsunamis  floods and earthquakes 
the philippines is additionally susceptible to volcanic eruptions 
substantially all of our operations centers and employees are located in india and the philippines 
if our operations centers are damaged by a typhoon  tsunami  flood  earthquake  volcanic eruption or other natural disaster  our operations and our ability to provide services to our clients could be interrupted or delayed significantly 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses 
in addition  although all of our operations centers have access to other power sources  disaster management facilities in india may not be adequate to protect against potential losses 
in addition  clients may terminate their contracts with us if we cannot resume providing services quickly enough 
as a result  a natural disaster in india or the philippines could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the us against our subsidiaries in india or our executive officers 
our primary operating subsidiaries are organized outside the us and a number of our executive officers reside outside of the us a substantial portion of our assets are located in india 
as a result  you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside in india outside their jurisdiction of residence 
in addition  you may be unable to enforce against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence judgments obtained in courts of the us  including judgments predicated solely upon the federal securities laws of the us sections a and section of the indian civil procedure code   or the civil code  govern recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments 
section a of the civil code provides for recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment without having to file an original suit in india  provided such judgments have been rendered by courts in a country or territory outside india which the government of india has declared to be a reciprocating territory 
we have been advised by our indian counsel that the us and india do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments other than certain arbitration awards in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the us based on civil liability  whether or not it is predicated upon the federal securities laws of the us  would not be enforceable in india as such 
however  if the party in whose favor such final judgment is rendered brings a new suit in a competent court in india based on a final judgment that has been obtained in the us  section of the civil code provides that the foreign judgment will be conclusive as to certain matters 
the suit must be brought in india within three years of the date of the foreign judgment 
it is unlikely  however  that a court in india would award damages on the same basis as a court in the us if an action is brought in india 
it is also unlikely that an indian court would enforce judgments obtained in the us if it viewed the amount of damages awarded as excessive or inconsistent with indian practice

overview we are a leading provider of outsourcing and transformation services and focus on providing our clients with a positive business impact and enhancing their long term financial value 
we customize our services to improve the economics of business performance and transform organizations to be leaner and more flexible 
our outsourcing services provide front  middle and back office processing services for our primarily us based and us based clients 
outsourcing services involve the transfer to us of select business operations of a client  such as claims processing  finance and accounting and customer service  after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis 
we also offer a number of transformation services that include decision analytics  finance transformation and operations and process excellence services 
these transformation services help our clients improve their operating environments through cost reduction  enhanced efficiency and productivity initiatives  and improve the risk and control environments within our clients operations whether or not they are outsourced to us 
we serve primarily the needs of global companies in the insurance and healthcare  utilities  banking and financial services  transportation and logistics and travel sectors 
on may   we completed the opi acquisition  pursuant to a merger agreement  dated as of april  the aggregate consideration paid to opi s former stockholders in the opi acquisition was million in cash  excluding adjustments based on opi s working capital  debt and certain expenses incurred by opi in connection with the consummation of the opi acquisition 
we acquired opi to strengthen our position as a provider of finance and accounting outsourcing services 
at the time of the acquisition  opi had over  professionals globally and approximately clients 
by combining our existing finance and accounting outsourcing and transformation capabilities with opi s finance and accounting outsourcing capabilities and proprietary technology tools  we intend to provide a comprehensive set of finance and accounting services to our clients 
the opi acquisition also furthers a strategic objective of leveraging technology and proprietary intellectual property in our service delivery 
on october   we acquired trumbull  a market leader in subrogation services for property and casualty insurance companies  from the hartford financial services group  inc hartford 
with the trumbull acquisition  we have strengthened our leadership position in the insurance industry with a highly skilled and experienced employee base and access to an advanced software platform  and have become a leading provider of complex insurance subrogation outsourcing services 
we market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams  which are aligned by industry verticals and cross industry domains such as finance and accounting 
our sales and client management teams operate from the us and europe and are supported by our business development team  which operates from the us and india 
in  we strengthened our marketing efforts with new leadership  an expanded team and the execution of integrated marketing campaigns 
we operate twelve operations centers in india  two operations centers in the us  and one operations center in each of philippines  romania and the czech republic 
in addition to these operations centers  we acquired three operations centers in india  two operations centers in bulgaria  one operations center in malaysia and two operations centers in the us as part of the opi acquisition 
we also acquired an operations center in the us as part of the trumbull acquisition 
in december   we completed a significant expansion of our operations center located in noida  india  which is eligible for tax incentives due to its location in a sez 

table of contents in january  we added an operations center in manila  philippines 
in february  we inaugurated the exl center for talent in noida  india  our first facility exclusively dedicated to recruitment  capability enhancement and talent development 
we are also in the process of expanding several of our other operations centers globally 
revenues we generate revenues principally from contracts to provide outsourcing and transformation services 
total revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenues from outsourcing services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues from outsourcing services of million was driven primarily by revenues of million from the opi acquisition and the trumbull acquisition in and the acquisitions of american express global travel service center gtsc and professional data management again pdma in  revenues from a one time payment of million from a client with no associated costs and net volume increases from existing and new clients aggregating to million 
these increases were offset partially by a net decrease in revenues of million  primarily due to the depreciation of the indian rupee and appreciation of the uk pound sterling and czech koruna against the us dollar during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues from transformation services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a combination of increased revenues in recurring or annuity decision analytics services and an increase in project based engagements both in our decision analytics and operations and process excellence services 
revenues from new clients for transformation services were million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our revenues will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base  both organically and through acquisitions 
we provide our clients with a range of outsourcing services  such as insurance and healthcare  utilities  banking and financial services  transportation and logistics and travel sectors  as well as cross industry bpo services  such as finance and accounting services 
our clients transfer the management and execution of their processes or business functions to us 
as part of this transfer  we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant outsourcing services  implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client s customers 
each client contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement 
the outsourcing services we provide to any of our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income that we derive from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
for outsourcing services  we enter into long term agreements with our clients with typical initial terms ranging from three to eight years 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
although these agreements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our outsourcing services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
revenues under new client contracts also vary depending on when we complete the selling cycle and the implementation phase 
we offer a number of service offerings that we refer to collectively as transformation services 
these offerings include decision analytics  finance transformation and operations and process excellence services 
these transformation services focus on helping our clients by improving their operating environments through 
table of contents cost reduction  enhanced efficiency  higher productivity  improved effectiveness of business decisions and improved risk and control environment within our clients operations whether or not they are outsourced to us 
our transformation services can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
we have experienced a significant increase in demand for our annuity based transformation services  which are engagements that are contracted for one to three year terms 
in addition  our transformation services consist primarily of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one year and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to further material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
we serve clients mainly in the us and the us  with these two regions generating approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large clients 
in the years ended december  and  our total revenues from our three largest clients were million and million  respectively  accounting for and of our total revenues  respectively  during these periods 
we provide services to travelers  which represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under a services agreement 
travelers may terminate the services agreement  which has no fixed term  or any work assignment or work order thereunder  each of which expires in december  without cause upon days prior notice 
we provide services to centrica  which represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under an agreement that expires in april centrica has the option to extend the contract for two annual extension periods 
this contract can be terminated by centrica without cause upon three months prior notice and payment of a breakup fee 
we provide services to american express  which represented million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december  and million  or of our total revenues for the year ended december   under a separate agreement for each of our outsourcing services and transformation services 
the master services agreement for our outsourcing services provides a minimum volume commitment over a period of eight years until february and renews automatically for successive twelve month periods unless either we or american express provides notice six months prior to the expiration of the initial term 
the master services agreement for our outsourcing services cannot be terminated by american express without cause 
the master agreement for our transformation services may be terminated by american express without cause upon five days prior written notice 
we derived revenues from seventeen and twenty one new clients for our services in the years ended december  and  respectively 
although we are increasing and diversifying our customer base  we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients 
revenues also include amounts representing reimbursable expenses that are billed to and reimbursed by our clients and typically include telecommunication and travel related costs 
the amount of reimbursable expenses that we incur  and any resulting revenues  can vary significantly depending on each client s situation and on the type of services we provide 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our total revenues represent reimbursement of such expenses 

table of contents to the extent our client contracts do not contain provisions to the contrary  we bear the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our contracts 
we hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar  philippine rupee us dollar and uk pound uk dollar foreign currency exposure 
we have observed a shift in industry pricing models toward transaction based pricing and other pricing models 
we believe this trend will continue and we have begun to use transaction based and other pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a billing rate model to a transaction based or other pricing model 
during the year ended december   of our outsourcing revenues were generated from transaction based pricing models 
such models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain our operating margins 
in addition  we have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs 
we believe that the trend toward multi vendor relationships will continue 
a multi vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor  which can result in significantly reduced operating margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor 
to the extent our large clients expand their use of multi vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors  our operating margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationship with such clients 
expenses cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of employee costs  which include salary  bonus and other compensation expenses  recruitment and training costs  employee insurance  transport and meals  rewards and recognition for certain employees  and non cash stock compensation expense  and costs relating to our facilities and communications network  which include telecommunication and it costs  facilities and customer management support  operational expenses for our outsourcing centers  rent expenses  and travel and other billable costs to our clients 
the most significant components of our cost of revenues are employee compensation  recruitment  training  transport  meals  rewards and recognition and employee insurance 
salary levels  employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues 
while salary increases are generally awarded each year effective april  in certain of our group companies  they are effective july accordingly  employee costs are generally lower in the first quarter of each year compared to the rest of the year 
we make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements 
although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated  a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes a non cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients 
we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operating centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally 
in particular  we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients and provide existing staff with additional skill sets 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
as our existing competitors continue to grow  and as new competitors enter the market  we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to 
table of contents increase  with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals 
however  a significant portion of our client contracts include adjustments towards inflation to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues 
we also expect our cost of revenues to increase due to employee turnover resulting in higher recruitment and training costs 
see item a risk factors employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
cost of revenues is also affected by our long selling cycle and implementation period for our outsourcing services  which require significant commitments of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
in addition  once a client engages us in a new contract  our cost of revenues may represent a higher percentage of revenues until the implementation phase for that contract  generally three to four months  is completed 
selling  general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries of senior management and other support personnel  legal and other professional fees  telecommunications  utilities and other miscellaneous administrative costs 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel  sales commission  travel and brand building  client events and conferences 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding 
we also expect our costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development  performance management and training programs 
however  our sg a as a percentage of revenues has declined from in to in as a result of our acquisition of opi and operating leverage in sg a expenses also include acquisition related costs  professional fees  which represent the costs of third party legal  tax  accounting and other advisors  bad debt allowance and non cash amortization of stock compensation expense related to our issuance of equity awards to senior management  members of our board of directors  other support personnel and consultants 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation and amortization of our tangible assets  including network equipment  cabling  computers  office furniture and equipment  motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
as we add new facilities and expand our existing operations centers  we expect that depreciation expense will increase  reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers  servers and other infrastructure 
amortization of intangible assets acquired is included in depreciation and amortization 
amortization of intangible assets has increased substantially in due to the opi acquisition and the trumbull acquisition in and the acquisitions of gtsc and pdma in we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions 
foreign exchange exchange rates we report our financial results in us dollars 
however  a significant portion of our total revenues is earned in uk pounds sterling and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and while a significant portion of our expenses is incurred and paid in indian rupees and  respectively  of our total costs for the years ended december  and and the philippine peso and  respectively  of our total costs for the year ended december  and 
the exchange 
table of contents rates among the indian rupee  the philippine peso  the uk pound sterling and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate in the future 
the results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the indian rupee and uk pound sterling appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar

currency regulation according to the prevailing foreign exchange regulations in india  an exporter of outsourcing and transformation services that is registered with a software technology park in india  such as our indian subsidiaries in india  is required to realize its export proceeds within a period of months from the date of exports 
similarly  in the event that such exporter has received any advance against exports in foreign exchange from its overseas customers  it will have to render the requisite services so that the advances so received are earned within a period of months 
if those subsidiaries in india did not meet these conditions  they would be required to obtain permission from the reserve bank of india 
income taxes the fiscal year under the indian income tax act ends on march certain of the company s operations centers in india qualified for an exemption from corporate tax under section a or b of the indian income tax act 
this exemption was available for a period of ten consecutive years beginning with the financial year in which the operations center began to manufacture or produce eligible goods and services and expired on april  as a result of the expiry of the tax holiday period  the tax holiday period for those of the company s operations centers in india that had not expired on april  expired on april  therefore  profits generated from the services provided from such operations centers have become fully taxable and consequently  the company s tax expense increased significantly in and may continue to be higher after the special economic zones act  and rules framed thereunder the sez regulations  introduced a year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated sezs 
under the sez regulations  qualifying operations are eligible for a profit based deduction from taxable income equal to i of the export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations  ii of such export profits for the next five years  and iii subject to satisfying certain investment requirements  of the export profits for a further five years 
our operations centers in jaipur and noida  which were established in sezs in  are eligible for tax incentives until as part of the opi acquisition  we also acquired operations centers in bengaluru and kochi  india that are also established in sezs 
the operations center in bengaluru will complete its first five years of operations on march  under the tax regulations  the bengaluru operations center will be entitled to a tax exemption on profits from april   after which there will be an increase in the tax expense for such center 
we anticipate establishing additional operations centers in sezs in the future 
the direct taxes code proposed by the government of india and currently pending before the indian parliament proposes grandfathering the existing profit based tax benefits for operations centers in sezs already receiving such tax benefits 
the direct taxes code also proposes discontinuing profit based incentives for operations centers in sezs set up after march  and replaces them with investment based incentives for operations centers in sezs established after that date 
accordingly  we expect to continue receiving the benefit of tax deductions for our existing operations centers in sezs pursuant to the current regulations until the currently proposed march  sunset date 
if this grandfathering does not happen under the direct taxes code and if the sunset date is brought forward  our new operations centers in sezs will not receive profit based tax benefits 
without such benefits  we expect that our tax rate in india and our overall tax rate will increase over the next few years and that such increase may be material 

table of contents we currently benefit from a four year income tax holiday for one of our operations centers in the philippines that will expire in the middle of but is extendable for an additional two years 
our new operations center in the philippines  inaugurated in january  will also benefit from a four year income tax holiday that is extendable for an additional two years 
while we intend to apply for extensions of these holidays when they expire  it is possible that such extensions could be denied  or these holidays could be removed entirely due to changes in the government of the philippines 
should either of these events occur  our philippine tax liability could increase 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies include revenue recognition  estimating tax liabilities  stock based compensation  goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  derivative instruments and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans 
these accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below 
future events may not develop exactly as forecast and estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from outsourcing and transformation services 
revenues from outsourcing services are recognized primarily on a time and material  cost plus or unit priced basis  revenues from transformation services are recognized primarily on a time and material  fixed price or contingent fee basis 
the services provided within our contracts generally contain one unit of accounting 
revenues are recognized under our contracts generally when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  services have been performed and collection of amounts billed is reasonably assured 
revenues under time and material contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues are recognized on cost plus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreed upon profit markup 
revenues are recognized on unit price based contracts based on the number of specified units of work such as the number of email responses delivered to a client 
such revenues are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with the client contract 
when the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met such as turnaround time or accuracy  we monitor such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred 
revenues are recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client 
we have experienced minimal service credits and penalties to date 
revenues from software licensing arrangements are recognized at the later of time of delivery or expiration of significant termination rights 
revenues from fixed term maintenance and support contracts are recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the period of the contract 
revenues from contracts for software modification are generally fixed price contracts and are recognized under the proportional performance method as described below 
revenues are recognized on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we estimate the proportional performance of a contract by comparing the actual number of hours or days worked to the 
table of contents estimated total number of hours or days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
we regularly monitor our estimates for completion of a project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined 
if a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project  such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified 
we make accruals for revenues and receivables for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date 
accordingly  our accounts receivable include amounts for services that we have performed and for which an invoice has not yet been issued to the client 
these are included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet and the amounts are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations asc no 
 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
the guidance specifies criteria as to intangible assets acquired in a business combination that must be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc no 
 all assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses including goodwill are assigned to reporting units 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  or as circumstances warrant 
when determining the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital  discount rates  risk free rates  market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc no 
 cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting periods 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment  including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised  the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their share based options  we have used data on the historical exercise pattern of employees 
we use the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatility of stocks of our comparative companies in order to estimate future share price trends 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zero coupon bonds with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if the actual forfeiture rate differs significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business  we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under our policies  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the uk pound sterling and the indian rupee 
we also have exposure in philippine pesos  czech koruna and other local currencies where we operate 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the underlying exposure from foreign currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and not for speculative trading purposes 
we hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated effective and that qualify as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc no 

changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges which are deemed effective  are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
we also use derivatives consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments under asc no 
to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
derivative assets and liabilities included in level primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts 
the quotes are taken primarily from highly rated financial institutions 
we evaluate hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis 
if during this time  a contract is deemed ineffective  the change in the fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of income and is included in foreign exchange gain loss 
for hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period  any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved 
deferred tax assets are recognized in full  subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
with respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday  deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday 
we also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required 
a reserve is recorded if we believe 
table of contents that a loss is more likely than not to occur and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
such reserves are based on estimates and  consequently  are subject to changing facts and circumstances  including the progress of ongoing audits  changes in case law and the passage of new legislation 
we believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover any potential additional tax assessments 
we generally anticipate that we will indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries or have the ability to repatriate in a tax free manner 
accordingly  we do not accrue any material income  distribution or withholding taxes that would otherwise arise if such earnings were repatriated in a taxable manner 
we employ a two step process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining  based on the technical merits  that the position will  more likely than not  be sustained upon examination 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
our provision for income tax expense also takes into account any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
retirement benefits we provide our employees in india and the philippines with benefits under a defined benefit plan  which we refer to as the gratuity plan 
the gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or on termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employee s salary and years of employment with us 
we determine our liability under the gratuity plan by actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method 
under this method  we determine our liability based upon the discounted value of salary increases until the date of separation arising from retirement  death  resignation or other termination of services 
critical assumptions used in measuring the plan expense and projected liability under the projected unit credit method include the discount rate  expected return on assets and the expected increase in the compensation rates 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  our gratuity expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

however  while management of working capital  including timing of collections and payments  affects operating results only indirectly  the impact on the working capital and cash flows provided by operating activities can be significant

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the loss of future earnings  fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 
our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to loss 
we manage market risk through our treasury operations 
our senior management and our board of directors approve our treasury operation s objectives and policies 
the activities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources  implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures  borrowing strategies  if any  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies 
components of market risk foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars in the year ended december  or uk pounds sterling in the year ended december   a substantial portion of our expenses were incurred and paid in indian rupees and philippine pesos and  respectively  in the year ended december  
we also incur expenses in us dollars  the czech koruna and the currencies of the other countries in which we have operations 
the exchange rates primarily among the indian rupee  the philippine peso  uk pound sterling  czech koruna and the uk dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues  expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivable and payable 
based upon our level of operations during the year ended december  and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period  a appreciation depreciation in the indian rupee against the us dollar would have increased decreased our revenues in the year ended december  by approximately million and our expenses incurred and paid in indian rupees by approximately million 
we have sought to reduce the effect of indian rupee and philippine peso and certain other local currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts to cover a substantial portion of our expected cash flows 
further  a significant number of our customer contracts include protection against foreign exchange rate fluctuations which minimizes the impact of volatility in the exchange rates on our operating results 
forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of million were outstanding at december  compared to million outstanding at december  at december   the cash flow hedging derivatives had maturity periods of one to thirty three months 
these contracts must be settled on the day of maturity or may be cancelled subject to the payment of any gains or losses in the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation 
we use these instruments as cash flow hedges and not for speculative purposes 
we may not purchase contracts adequate to insulate ourselves from indian rupee and philippine pesos foreign exchange currency risks 
in addition  any such contracts may not perform adequately as a hedging mechanism 
we may  in the future  adopt more active hedging policies  and have done so in the past 
we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as foreign exchange gain loss 

table of contents these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on the settlement of these derivatives are intended to offset revaluation losses and gains on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  compared to million  gbp million and eur million outstanding at december  at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million at december  these amounts were invested principally in a short term investment portfolio primarily comprised of highly rated mutual funds  money market accounts and time deposits 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income 
a basis points change in short term rates would impact our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings under the credit facility 
credit risk 
as of december   we had accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable from our two largest clients accounted for and of our total outstanding receivable as of december  we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our financial statements and have not exceeded our expectations
