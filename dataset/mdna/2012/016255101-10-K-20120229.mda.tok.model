overview align technology  inc is a global medical device company that pioneered the invisible orthodontics market with the introduction of the invisalign system in today  we are focused on designing  manufacturing and marketing innovative  technology rich products to help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective  convenient cutting edge dental treatment options to their patients 
align technology was founded in march and is headquartered in san jose  california with offices worldwide 
our international headquarters are located in amsterdam  the netherlands 
we have two operating segments clear aligner  known as the invisalign system  and scanners and cad cam services  known as itero and ioc intra oral scanners and orthocad services 
we received fda clearance in and began our first commercial sales of invisalign to us orthodontists in in  we launched our first us national consumer advertising campaign and a year later introduced invisalign to the european market  launching the first phase of international expansion 
in  invisalign was made available to gps and in mid  leading dental schools began adding invisalign to their curriculum 
over the next several years  we introduced several new products including invisalign express  invisalign teen  invisalign assist and vivera retainers  launched invisalign in japan  and added three distribution partners for smaller non core country markets in the asia pacific  emea  and latin america regions 
by  we had launched invisalign g and invisalign g  which includes significant new aligner and software features across all invisalign products that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more complex cases  and launched invisalign in the people s republic of china 
in  we acquired cadent holdings  inc  a leading provider of d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry  and makers of the itero and ioc intra oral scanners and orthocad services 
we believe that the combination of align s and cadent s technologies and capabilities creates greater growth opportunities for align by bringing innovative new invisalign treatment tools to customers and by extending the value of intra oral scanning in dental practices 
intra oral scanners provide a dental chair side platform for accessing valuable digital diagnosis and treatment tools  with potential for enhancing accuracy of records  treatment efficiency  and the overall patient experience 
we believe there are numerous benefits for customers and the opportunity to accelerate the adoption of invisalign through interoperability with our intra oral scanners 
the use of digital technologies such as cad cam for restorative dentistry or in office restorations has been growing rapidly and intra oral scanning is a critical part of enabling these new digital technologies and procedures in dental practices 
our business has grown over the past five years  driven by numerous product introductions  expansion of our international markets  penetration into the teenager segment  and by evolving consumer demand programs while increasing operational efficiencies 
between fiscal year and  north american revenues increased from approximately million to approximately while international revenues have increased from million to million 
for fiscal  revenues increased year over year driven by invisalign adoption by all customer channels and geographies despite continuing challenges in the global economy as well as the introduction of sales of itero and ioc intra oral scanners and orthocad services 
the invisalign system is offered in more than countries and has been used to treat more than million patients 
our itero and ioc intra oral scanners are available in over countries and provide dental professionals with an open choice to send digital impressions to any laboratory based cad cam system or to any of the more than  dental labs worldwide 

table of contents our goal is to establish the invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and to establish our intra oral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for d digital scans  ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals 
we intend to achieve this by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives product innovation and clinical effectiveness 
we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future long term goal to drive and sustain product adoption  which includes introducing new products along with significant evolution in features and functionality 
in the past four years  we have announced new invisalign products and significant feature enhancements that make it easier for doctors to use invisalign on more patients 
for example  invisalign teen launched in addresses the larger teenage segment most commonly treated by orthodontists 
in addition  new features and enhancements introduced with invisalign g and invisalign g  are engineered to address some of the most significant treatment challenges doctors encounter 
through the acquisition of cadent  we now have a leading intra oral scanner which provides unique chair side digital tools for a range of procedures including invisalign digital case submission 
following the acquisition  we announced invisalign interoperability on the ioc and itero intra oral scanners  which enable our customers to better integrate their technologies and invisalign treatment process while enhancing the patient experience through digital scanning instead of taking traditional pvs impressions 
we also launched new and enhanced software features for the ioc and itero intra oral scanners  which include improved digital workflows for both the straumann and biomet i fixture level implant integrations with new detailed implant prescription options 
finally  the new itero dual scanner launched in january allows multiple specialty practices to utilize one intra oral scanner to service all their scanning needs including crown and bridge  implants  and orthodontic treatment 
an upgrade is also available for existing itero customers who would like to add ioc orthodontic software functionality to their scanner 
we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption and frequency of use  however  we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years 
during  we plan to continue to invest in product and technology development and will continue to introduce feature enhancements across our products as well as introduce chair side applications 
enhancing the customer experience 
we are committed to enhancing the customer experience through the evolution of our customer facing systems and programs making it easier for our customers to adopt our products into their practice and increase utilization 
we provide robust clinical education resources and training programs through instructor led training classes  seminars and workshops as well as online training through webinars  blogs  and online educational websites such as our aligntech institute www 
aligntechinstitute 
com and cadent www 
cadentinc 
com websites 
our customer support teams consist of over treatment technicians and customer support staff available to help our customers with their cases and treatment plans 
our sales representatives provide additional support and practice development tools such as staff training  software tips and tools  practice marketing guides and marketing materials  as well as any assistance with the invisalign or itero ioc system process 
lastly  we offer our customers varying product promotional discounts and incentive programs as a means to improve the customer experience and increase utilization 
our largest north american program  the advantage rebate program  allows eligible orthodontist and gps to earn volume rebates and marketing benefits for exceeding quarterly case shipment thresholds and participating in continuing education 
additional tiered benefits range from practice development materials  marketing consulting  and access to dedicated clinical technicians 
during  we plan to continue providing our high standard educational resources and improving our customer support processes as we centralize our newly acquired intra oral scanner related customer support team 
increasing the effectiveness of our consumer demand creation and extending invisalign brand awareness 
as an established and known brand within the dental industry  efficiently marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving long term growth 

table of contents our market research indicates that the majority of adults with malocclusion forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations  such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort 
in addition  many parents also elect traditional treatment for their teenagers due to limited awareness of invisalign treatment applicability for teenager use 
our goals are to extend our leadership in clear aligner therapy with adults  increase awareness and consumer demand with moms and teens  and to continue expansion of the clear aligner category overall 
we continue to be successful with programs that more effectively and efficiently generate demand or pull for invisalign treatment 
in the past several years  we continued building awareness and demand through an integrated consumer marketing platform of traditional media  event marketing and digital and social media 
in addition  we continued to evolve our marketing program aimed specifically at the teenage segment to increase awareness and educate prospective teen patients and their parents 
in  we leveraged online and mobile widgets  social media and blogs directly targeted to teens and launched a commercial prompting parents and teens to learn more about invisalign treatment 
we will continue to build on these programs and efforts in growth of international markets 
we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of our products by dental professionals in our core european markets as well as expansion into new markets 
in the past five years  we have grown our core direct business in europe and japan from million in to million in at the end of  international sales represented approximately of net worldwide revenues 
we trained over  doctors on the invisalign system internationally  predominantly orthodontists in europe which is our primary international market 
due to the higher number of complex malocclusion cases in international markets compared to north america  product expansion and enhancements are important to providing doctors with treatment options that address a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility 
the recent invisalign g and invisalign g features designed to address those complex treatment issues is a significant product evolution 
we are also expanding our market presence globally 
in may  we announced commercial availability of the invisalign system in china 
while we do not expect meaningful revenue from china for several years  our focused strategy to launch invisalign in four major cities of china such as shanghai  beijing  shenzhen  and guangzhou provides us a large growth opportunity long term 
additionally  although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales  approximately of our international invisalign sales in fiscal are from distribution partners covering non core country markets in the asia pacific  emea  and latin america regions 
in early  the invisalign system was commercially launched in turkey through our emea distribution partner 
in december  we received regulatory approval for the invisalign system in russia and commercial launch of invisalign in russia and the middle east began in also through our emea distribution partner 
with these efforts  we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future 
in addition to the successful execution of our business strategy  there are a number of other factors which may affect our results in and beyond as set forth below product innovation and clinical effectiveness 
we believe that  in addition to an increase in the number of patients visiting dental offices throughout as reported by our customers  as well as patient interest in higher value procedures  invisalign g was an important contributor to the increased utilization in by our north american orthodontic customers 
additionally  since most of our international customers are orthodontists  we believe the international launch of invisalign g in may was important for continued growth both in our existing international markets and to support our expansion in new markets like china 
we expect that the innovations in g will build on the success we have seen with invisalign g and encourage even greater confidence and adoption in our customers practices 
additionally  with the introduction of new software features to the ioc and itero intra oral scanners along with invisalign interoperability  we believe that over the long term these types of product and clinical innovation will increase adoption of invisalign and increase sales of our intra oral scanners 
however  it is difficult to predict the rate of adoption which may vary by region and channel 

table of contents investments to increase manufacturing capacity 
we are currently transitioning our aligner fabrication and intra oral scanner related activities from our existing facility in juarez  mexico into our new  square foot property purchased facility in september the lease on our existing facility expires in july our ability to plan  construct and equip this additional manufacturing facility is subject to significant risk and uncertainty  including delays and cost overruns 
if the opening of this facility is significantly delayed for any reason  or if demand for our product in exceeds our current expectations  or if the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter is different from our expectations  we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner  which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business 
consolidation of new jersey operations 
in september  we announced plans to consolidate our cad cam services and intra oral scanner related activities based in carlstadt  new jersey with our existing manufacturing and shared services organizations in order to optimize efficiency  consolidate customer facing functions  and reduce operating costs 
all existing intra oral scanner research and development and manufacturing operations will remain in or yehuda  israel 
these actions include a phased transition of the following activities over the next few quarters consolidation of customer care for cad cam services and intra oral scanners into our existing shared services organization in san jose  costa rica  transition of cad cam services and intra oral scanner distribution and repair to our treat operations in san jose  costa rica and our manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico  and consolidation of accounting and finance functions at our corporate headquarters in san jose  california  and closure of the new jersey facility by the third quarter of the consolidation of our new jersey operations includes a total reduction of full time headcount in carlstadt  new jersey 
the transition began in the fourth quarter of and is expected to be completed by the third quarter of as part of this consolidation  we will incur costs for severance estimated to be approximately million  of which approximately million was realized in and million over the first three quarters of after the new jersey consolidation is complete  we expect to realize annualized net savings of approximately million per year 
see part ii  item a risk factors for risks related to the consolidation of new jersey operations 

table of contents invisalign utilization rates 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals  or utilization 
our quarterly utilization rates for the previous quarters are as follows logo invisalign utilization rates of cases shipped divided by of doctors cases were shipped to total utilization in the fourth quarter of increased slightly to cases per doctor  driven mostly by our north american gp customers and international doctors 
utilization among our north american orthodontist customers declined slightly from the third quarter of to cases per doctor  reflecting seasonality in their teenage patient case starts 
although we expect that over the long term our utilization rates will gradually improve  we expect that period over period comparisons of our utilization rates will fluctuate 
acquisition of cadent 
on april   we acquired privately held cadent  a leading provider of d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry 
the acquisition of cadent positions us as a leader in one of the best growth opportunities in dentistry and medical devices today 
over the next five years  we expect that intra oral scanners will become widely used in dental practices 
we believe that the combination of the two companies will help accelerate the use of intra oral scanning in the dental industry by leveraging align s global sales reach  extensive professional and consumer marketing capabilities and base of over thousand clincheck software users 
intra oral scanners also strengthen our ability to drive adoption of invisalign by integrating invisalign treatment more fully with mainstream tools and procedures in doctors practices 
we may  however  experience difficulties in achieving the anticipated financial or strategic benefits of the acquisition 
information regarding risks associated with the cadent acquisition may be found in item of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
number of new invisalign doctors trained 
we continue to expand our invisalign customer base through training new doctors 
in  we expect to train approximately  orthodontists and gps in north america and internationally  which is approximately the same number we trained in foreign exchange rates 
although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies 
revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency 
table of contents exchanges rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 
stock repurchase 
on october   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of common stock 
as of december   we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share for a total of million 
purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market

geographically  both north america and international revenue increased by million due to an growth in case volume  favorable foreign exchange rates  and the inclusion of eight months of scanner and cad cam service revenues 
invisalign case volume growth was driven by both improved utilization and an increase in the number of doctors submitting cases 
revenue from our clear aligner segment  consisting of our invisalign products  increased by as a result of additional case volumes across all products 
the most significant volume percentage increases were in the invisalign teen and assist products 
although invisalign teen case volume increased  revenue for invisalign teen was comparable to the prior year primarily because of the million release of deferred revenue in invisalign assist revenue growth was comprised of both an increase in case volume and additional revenue being recognized as each batch is shipped over the course of treatment instead of deferring until the final batch shipment 
additionally  invisalign non case revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were higher in compared to primarily due to increased sales of our vivera product 
since date of the acquisition until the end of the fiscal year end  the scanner and cad cam services segment generated million of revenue from sales of itero and ioc scanners and orthocad services 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues increased in as compared to primarily as a result of worldwide volume growth across all customer channels 
the release of revenue previously deferred for invisalign teen replacement aligners in the second quarter of contributed an additional million to total net revenues for in  north america revenue increased compared to due to overall case volume growth of as well as an increase in our average selling price 
higher case volume was driven primarily by the north american orthodontic channel reflecting increased penetration into the teenage orthodontic market  especially with the invisalign teen product 
additionally  the increase also reflects a significant reduction in our revenue deferral rate for teen replacement aligners and lower discounts and rebates 
our international invisalign revenue increased in compared to mainly due to growth in case volumes across all products partially offset by a mix shift towards our lower priced products  as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
invisalign teen includes up to six replacement aligners which may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 
through the second quarter of  revenue for these replacement aligners was deferred based on percent of the fair value of the aligners until the replacement aligners were used or the case completed 
since the launch of invisalign teen in  we evaluated the usage experience of the replacement aligners and determined that there is sufficient historical experience to establish an estimated usage rate 
as a result  in june  we reduced deferred revenue for invisalign teen replacement aligners by million to reflect the lower estimated usage for in process cases 
invisalign non case revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were higher in compared to primarily due to increased sales of our vivera and retainer products

determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable 
we exercise significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth  forecasted earnings and projected taxable income  in determining the provision for income taxes  and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance of approximately million is mostly related to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  because we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets 
these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
the california budget legislation included the ability to elect to apply a single sales factor apportionment for years beginning after january  as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor  we re measured our deferred taxes taking into account the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of our cash paid for the acquisition of cadent of approximately million and approximately million of property  plant  and equipment purchases 
we also had restricted cash of approximately million which primarily represents funds we hold as unclaimed merger consideration related to the acquisition of cadent on april  these costs were partially offset by net maturities of marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of equipment of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of approximately million for purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment which was partially offset by net maturities of our marketable securities of million 
although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of impairment  we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain unimpaired 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of approximately million used for the purchase of property and equipment which were partially offset by million of net maturities from marketable securities 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily resulting from approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately million from excess tax provision from our share based arrangements 
these proceeds were partially offset by approximately million common stock repurchases and million of taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily resulting from approximately million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock and approximately million from excess tax provision from our share based arrangements 
these proceeds were partially offset by approximately million of taxes paid for our employees vesting of restricted stock units 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which resulted primarily from million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock 
these proceeds were partially offset from the tax benefit excess of shared based payments and taxes paid on vesting restricted stock units of million 
net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercise 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf 
during   and  we paid million  million  and million of taxes related to rsus that vested during the period for executive officers  respectively 
line of credit on december   we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank 
under this revolving line of credit  we have million of available borrowings with a maturity date of 
table of contents december  the interest rate on borrowings will range from libor plus to depending upon the amount of cash we maintain at comerica bank 
this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of million 
additionally  in the event our unrestricted cash deposited is less than million  the unused facility fee will increase from per quarter to per quarter 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and are in compliance with the financial covenants 
stock repurchase on october   we announced that our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of common stock 
purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at an average price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million including commissions 
as of december   there remains million under our existing stock repurchase authorization 
investments to increase manufacturing capacity on august  we purchased land and a manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico for approximately million in order to expand our current manufacturing capacity in order meet expected demand 
we expect to incur costs in as we continue to construct and equip this facility to operate at full capacity 
contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements the impact that our contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods is as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately million of non current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long term obligations and deferred tax assets on our balance sheet as of december  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities  if any 
we executed an agreement on january  to lease  square feet of property in tel aviv  israel  where we produce our handheld intra oral scanner wand and have operations and general and administrative functions 
the monthly rent for this facility is approximately  and will expire in january we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  goodwill and finite lived assets and related impairment  and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in the fiscal year ended december   we adopted the new accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the financial accounting standard board fasb emerging issues task force 
this new guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant  replaces the residual method of allocation with the relative selling price method  and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables applying this method  including proportional allocation of any discounts to each deliverable 
multiple element arrangements meas arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and extended warranties 
the deliverables included in the meas are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered equipment has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  and ii delivery of the undelivered service element s is probable and substantially in our control 
based on the new accounting guidance adopted january   arrangement consideration is then allocated to each unit  delivered or undelivered  based on the relative selling price rsp of each unit of accounting based first on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if it exists second on third party evidence tpe if it exists and on estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe or tpe exist 
vsoe in most instances  products are sold separately in stand alone arrangements 
services are also sold separately through renewals of contracts with varying periods 
we determine vsoe based on its pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately  considering geographical  customer  and other economic or marketing variables  as well as renewal rates or stand alone prices for the service element s 
tpe if we cannot establish vsoe of selling price for a specific product or service included in a multiple element arrangement  we use third party evidence of selling price 
we determine tpe based on sales of comparable amount of similar product or service offered by multiple third parties considering the degree of customization and similarity of product or service sold 
esp the estimated selling price represents the price at which we would sell a product or service if it were sold on a stand alone basis 
when vsoe does not exist for all elements  we determine esp for the arrangement element based on sales  cost and margin analysis  as well as other inputs based on its pricing practices 
adjustments for other market and company specific factors are made as deemed necessary in determining esp 
we adopted these standards for applicable arrangements that were entered into or materially modified on or after january  implementation of these standards did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in the period under report and is not expected to significantly affect the timing and pattern of revenue recognition in future periods 

table of contents we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
we have not recorded any estimated losses for the periods presented 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
clear aligner we enter into arrangements treatment plans that involve multiple future product deliverables 
for example  included in the price of invisalign full  invisalign teen and invisalign assist  we offer optional case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient s teeth to the desired final position 
case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 
invisalign teen also includes six optional replacement aligners in the price of the product and may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 
we use vsoe adjusted by estimated usage rates for case refinements and replacement aligners to determine the respective esp 
in the absence of vsoe  we determine our best estimate of selling price  as if it is sold on a stand alone basis  and take into consideration our pricing and discounting strategies  market conditions  as well as historical price 
we regularly review our vsoe and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these estimates 
we determined that our treatment plans are comprised of four possible deliverables that represent separate units of accounting single batched aligners  multiple batched aligners  case refinement and replacement aligners 
we allocate revenue for each treatment plan based on each unit s relative selling price and recognize the revenue upon the delivery of each unit in the treatment plan 
the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year  and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized as each shipment occurs 
for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature  in which aligners are shipped to the dental professional every nine stages a batch 
we determined that each batch has stand alone value and therefore represents a separate unit of accounting 
the estimated selling price for invisalign assist with progress tracking is allocated according to the estimated number of batches 
prior to january   we used vsoe as fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables 
we deferred the fair value of case refinement and replacement aligner deliverables based on a breakage factor and recognized the residual revenue upon initial batch shipment 
the deferred revenue was subsequently recognized as the refinement and replacement aligners were shipped 
for invisalign assist with the progress tracking feature  we did not have independent evidence of fair value for the separate batches of aligners  so all batches of aligners were considered a single unit of accounting prior to january  for these treatment plans  revenue was deferred upon the first batched shipment and recognized upon the final batched shipment 
scanners and cad cam services we recognize revenues from the sales of itero and ioc intra oral scanners and cad cam services 
cad cam services include scanning services  extended warranty for the intra oral scanners  a range of itero restorative services and orthocad services such as orthocad icast  orthocad iq  and orthocad irecord 
we sell intra oral scanners and services through both our direct sales force and distribution partners 
the intra oral scanner sales price includes one year of warranty  and for additional fees  the customer may select an unlimited scanning service agreement over a fixed period of time or extended warranty periods 
revenue  net of related discounts and allowances  is recognized when products or equipment have been shipped  when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms  no significant obligations remain  and allowances for discounts  returns  and customer incentives can be reliably estimated 

table of contents discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is offered  whichever is later and free cases or training is included as a deliverable in the multiple element arrangement assessment 
returns of products  excluding warranty related returns  are infrequent and insignificant services service revenue  including itero restorative and all orthocad services are recognized upon delivery or ratably over the contract term as the specified services are performed 
extended warranties we offer customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products 
we recognize revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract 
the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 
when intra oral scanners are sold with either an unlimited scanning service agreement and or extended warranty  we allocate revenue based on each element s relative selling price 
we estimate the selling price of each element  as if it is sold on a stand alone basis  taking into consideration historical prices as well as our pricing and discounting strategies 
we will continue to review our estimates as we continue to integrate cadent into our business 
revenues for unlimited scanning service agreements and extended warranty are recognized ratably over the service periods 
if a customer selects a pay per use basis for scanning service fees  the revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
for direct sales and sales to certain distributors  intra oral scanner revenue is recognized once the intra oral scanner has been installed and on site training is completed 
for other distributors who provide installation and training to the customer  we recognize scanner revenue when the intra oral scanner is shipped to the distributor assuming all of the other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation expense we recognize stock based compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation and monte carlo simulation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
goodwill and finite lived purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in business combinations and is allocated to the reporting unit based on relative synergies generated 
our intangible assets primarily consist of intangible assets acquired as part of the cadent acquisition 
these assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of one to fifteen years  reflecting the period in which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized 
impairment of goodwill  finite lived purchased intangible assets and long lived assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the 
table of contents allocation of goodwill to the respective reporting unit are based on relative synergies generated as a result of an acquisition 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
in fiscal years  and  we performed the annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter for our reporting unit s and found no impairment as the fair value of our reporting unit s was significantly in excess of the carrying value 
we evaluate long lived assets including intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is calculated as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value which is estimated based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
there were no asset impairments during  or deferred tax valuation allowance we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as of december   with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  we believe that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporated herein 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and investments are fixed rate short term and long term securities 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  and as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million invested in available for sale marketable securities 
an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december  and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 
currency rate risk we operate in north america  europe  asia pacific  costa rica  israel  and japan 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries 
this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
the impact of an aggregate change of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material
