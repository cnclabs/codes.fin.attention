services and products data voice services wireless data communications services include mobile productivity applications  such as internet access  messaging and email services  wireless photo and video offerings  location based capabilities  including asset and fleet management  dispatch services and navigation tools  and mobile entertainment applications  including the ability to view live television  listen to satellite radio  download and listen to music  and game play with full color graphics and polyphonic and real music sounds from a wireless handset 
wireless voice communications services include basic local and long distance wireless voice services throughout the united states  as well as voicemail  call waiting  three way calling  caller identification  directory assistance and call forwarding 
we also provide voice and data services to areas in numerous countries outside of the united states through roaming arrangements 
we offer customized design  development  implementation and support for wireless services provided to large companies and government agencies 
products our services are provided using a wide variety of multi functional devices including smartphones  mobile broadband devices such as aircards and hotspots  and embedded tablets and laptops manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services 
we generally sell these devices at prices below our cost in response to competition to attract new subscribers and as retention inducements for existing subscribers 
we sell accessories  such as carrying cases  hands free devices  batteries  battery chargers and other items to subscribers  and we sell devices and accessories to agents and other third party distributors for resale 
wireless network technologies we deliver wireless services to subscribers primarily through our existing networks or as a reseller of g services through our mvno wholesale relationship with clearwire 
our current sprint platform  an all digital wireless network with spectrum licenses that allow us to provide service in all states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands  uses a single frequency band and a digital spread spectrum wireless technology  known as cdma  that allows a large number of users to access the band by assigning a code to all voice and data bits  sending a scrambled transmission of the encoded bits over the air and reassembling the voice and data into its original format 
we provide nationwide service through a combination of operating our own digital network in both major and smaller us metropolitan areas and rural connecting routes  affiliations under commercial arrangements with third party affiliates affiliates and roaming on other providers networks 
in  our sprint platform subscribers in certain markets began to have access to clearwire s g wimax network through an mvno wholesale arrangement that enables us to resell clearwire s g wireless services under the sprint brand name 
the services supported by g give subscribers with compatible devices high speed access to the internet 
in december  we announced network vision  a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide subscribers with an enhanced network experience on our sprint platform by improving voice quality  coverage  and data speeds  while enhancing network flexibility  reducing operating costs  and improving environmental sustainability through the utilization of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station 
in addition to implementing these multi mode base stations  this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology known as sprint direct connect with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode 
table of contents chipsets into smartphones  tablets and other broadband devices  including machine to machine products 
through the successful deployment of network vision  we expect to migrate to a single nationwide network allowing for the consolidation and optimization of our megahertz mhz  gigahertz ghz as well as other spectrum owned by third parties into multi mode stations allowing us to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage  particularly around the in building experience 
the multi mode technology also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility  which also allows for the deployment of lte 
our nextel platform  which we plan to decommission during and  is an all digital packet data network based on iden wireless technology provided by motorola solutions  inc we are the only national wireless service provider in the united states that utilizes this technology 
generally  nextel platform devices that we currently offer are not enabled to roam on wireless networks that do not utilize iden technology 
as a result of our plan to decommission our nextel platform  we will continue to target the retention of these customers through competitive offerings on the sprint platform 
sales  marketing and customer care we focus the marketing and sales of wireless services on targeted groups of retail subscribers individual consumers  businesses and government 
we use a variety of sales channels to attract new subscribers of wireless services  including direct sales representatives whose efforts are focused on marketing and selling wireless services primarily to mid sized to large businesses and government agencies  retail outlets owned and operated by us  that focus on sales to the consumer market as well as third party retailers  indirect sales agents that primarily consist of local and national non affiliated dealers and independent contractors that market and sell services to businesses and the consumer market  and are generally paid through commissions  and subscriber convenient channels  including web sales and telesales 
we market our postpaid services under the sprint and nextel brands 
we offer these services on a contract basis typically for one or two year periods  with services billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan 
as we deploy network vision  our efforts will continue to focus on growing the sprint platform postpaid subscriber base including the migration of existing nextel platform subscribers to other offerings on our sprint platform  which includes future offerings on our multi mode network  such as sprint direct connect 
we market our prepaid services under the boost mobile  virgin mobile  and assurance wireless brands as a means to provide value driven prepaid service plans to particular markets 
our wholesale customers are resellers of our wireless services rather than end use subscribers and market their products and services using their brands 
although we market our services using traditional print and television advertising  we also provide exposure to our brand names and wireless services through various sponsorships  including the national association for stock car auto racing nascar and the national basketball association nba 
the goal of these marketing initiatives is to increase brand awareness and sales 
our customer management organization works to improve our customers experience  with the goal of retaining subscribers of our wireless services 
customer service call centers  some of which are operated by us and some of which are operated by unrelated parties subject to sprint standards of operation  receive and resolve inquiries from subscribers and proactively address subscriber needs 
competition we believe that the market for wireless services has been and will continue to be characterized by intense competition on the basis of price  the types of services and devices offered and quality of service 
we compete with a number of wireless carriers  including three other national wireless companies at t  verizon wireless verizon and t mobile 
our primary competitors offer voice  high speed data  entertainment and location based services and push to talk type features that are designed to compete with our products and services 
other competitors offer or have announced plans to introduce similar services 
at t and verizon also offer competitive wireless services packaged with local and long distance voice  high speed internet services and video 
our prepaid services compete with a number of carriers and resellers including metro pcs communications  inc  leap wireless international  inc and tracfone wireless  which offer competitively priced calling plans that include unlimited local calling 

table of contents additionally  at t  t mobile and verizon also offer competitive prepaid services and wholesale services to resellers 
competition will increase to the extent that new firms enter the market as a result of the introduction of other technologies such as lte  the availability of previously unavailable spectrum bands  such as the mhz spectrum band and the potential introduction of new services using unlicensed spectrum 
wholesale services and products also contribute to increased competition 
in some instances  resellers that use our network and offer like services compete against our offerings 
most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services  thereby limiting the growth of subscribers of wireless services 
as the wireless market has matured  it has become increasingly important to retain existing subscribers in addition to attracting new subscribers  particularly in less saturated growth markets such as those with non traditional data demands 
wireless carriers are addressing the growth in non traditional data needs by working with oems to develop connected devices such as after market in vehicle connectivity and electric vehicle charging stations  point of sale systems  kiosks and vending machines  asset tracking  digital signage  security  smartgrid utilities  medical equipment and a variety of other consumer electronics and appliances  which utilize wireless networks to increase consumer and business mobility 
in addition  we and our competitors continue to offer more service plans that combine voice and data offerings  plans that allow users to add additional mobile devices to their plans at attractive rates  plans with a higher number of bundled minutes included in the fixed monthly charge for the plan  plans that offer the ability to share minutes among a group of related subscribers  or combinations of these features 
consumers respond to these plans by migrating to those they deem most attractive 
in addition  wireless carriers also try to appeal to subscribers by offering devices at prices lower than their acquisition cost 
we may offer higher cost devices at greater discounts than our competitors  with the expectation that the loss incurred on the cost of the device will be offset by future service revenue 
as a result  we and our competitors recognize point of sale losses that are not expected to be recovered until future periods when services are provided 
our ability to effectively compete in the wireless business is dependent upon our ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers in an increasingly competitive marketplace 
see item a  risk factors if we are not able to retain and attract wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired 
wireline we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services to other communications companies and targeted business and consumer subscribers 
in addition  we provide voice  data and ip communication services to our wireless segment  and ip and other services to cable multiple system operators msos 
cable msos resell our local and long distance services and use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user subscribers 
we are one of the nation s largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital global long distance and tier ip networks 
services and products our services and products include domestic and international data communications using various protocols such as multiprotocol label switching technologies mpls  ip  managed network services  voice over internet protocol voip  session initiated protocol sip and traditional voice services 
our ip services can also be combined with wireless services 
such services include our sprint mobile integration service  which enables a wireless handset to operate as part of a subscriber s wireline voice network  and our datalink sm service  which uses our wireless networks to connect a subscriber location into their primarily wireline wide area ip mpls data network  making it easy for businesses to adapt their network to changing business requirements 
in addition to providing services to our business customers  the wireline network is carrying increasing amounts of voice and data traffic for our wireless segment as a result of growing usage by our wireless subscribers 
we continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our wireline business and are focusing our efforts on ip based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non ip based data services 
we also provide wholesale voice local and long distance services to cable msos  which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings  as well as traditional voice and data services for their enterprise use 
however  the digital voice services we provide to some of our cable msos have become large enough in scale that they have decided to in source these services 
we also continue to provide voice services to residential consumers 
our wireline segment markets and sells its services primarily through direct sales representatives 

table of contents competition our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon communications  centurylink  level communications  inc  other major local incumbent operating companies  and cable operators as well as a host of smaller competitors in the provision of wireline services 
over the past few years  our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies  as well as cable msos and internet service providers 
some competitors are targeting the high end data market and are offering deeply discounted rates in exchange for high volume traffic as they attempt to utilize excess capacity in their networks 
in addition  we face increasing competition from other wireless and ip based service providers 
many carriers are competing in the residential and small business markets by offering bundled packages of both local and long distance services 
competition in long distance is based on price and pricing plans  the types of services offered  customer service  and communications quality  reliability and availability 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new services that may be introduced  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions and pricing strategies 
see item a  risk factors consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services  as well as consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers used for wireless services  could adversely affect our revenues and profitability and the blurring of the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contributes to increased competition 
legislative and regulatory developments overview communications services are subject to regulation at the federal level by the federal communications commission fcc and in certain states by public utilities commissions pucs 
the communications act of communications act preempts states from regulating the rates or entry of commercial mobile radio service cmrs providers  such as those in our wireless segment  and imposes licensing and technical requirements  including provisions related to the acquisition  assignment or transfer of radio licenses 
depending upon state law  cmrs providers can be subject to state regulation of other terms and conditions of service 
our wireline segment also is subject to federal and state regulation 
the following is a summary of the regulatory environment in which we operate and does not describe all present and proposed federal  state and local legislation and regulations affecting the communications industry 
some legislation and regulations are the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proceedings that could change the way our industry operates 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters or their potential impact on our business 
see item a  risk factors government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects  future growth or results of operations 
regulation in the communications industry is subject to change  which could adversely affect us in the future 
the following discussion describes some of the significant communications related regulations that affect us  but numerous other substantive areas of regulation not discussed here may also influence our business 
regulation and wireless operations the fcc regulates the licensing  construction  operation  acquisition and sale of our wireless operations and wireless spectrum holdings 
fcc requirements impose operating and other restrictions on our wireless operations that increase our costs 
the fcc does not currently regulate rates for services offered by cmrs providers  and states are legally preempted from regulating such rates and entry into any market  although states may regulate other terms and conditions 
the communications act and fcc rules also require the fcc s prior approval of the assignment or transfer of control of an fcc license  although the fcc s rules permit spectrum lease arrangements for a range of wireless radio service licenses  including our licenses  with fcc oversight 
approval from the federal trade commission and the department of justice  as well as state or local regulatory authorities  also may be required if we sell or acquire spectrum interests 
the fcc sets rules  regulations and policies to  among other things grant licenses in the mhz band  mhz band  ghz personal communications services pcs band  and license renewals  rule on assignments and transfers of control of fcc licenses  and leases covering our use of fcc 
table of contents licenses held by other persons and organizations  govern the interconnection of our networks with other wireless and wireline carriers  establish access and universal service funding provisions  impose rules related to unauthorized use of and access to customer information  impose fines and forfeitures for violations of fcc rules  regulate the technical standards governing wireless services  and impose other obligations that it determines to be in the public interest we hold ghz  mhz  and mhz fcc licenses authorizing the use of radio frequency spectrum to deploy our wireless services 
we also hold fcc licenses that are not yet placed in service but that we intend to use in accordance with fcc requirements 
ghz pcs license conditions all pcs licenses are granted for ten year terms 
for purposes of issuing pcs licenses  the fcc utilizes major trading areas mtas and basic trading areas btas with several btas making up each mta 
each license is subject to build out requirements which we have met in all of our mta and bta markets 
if applicable build out conditions are met  these licenses may be renewed for additional ten year terms 
renewal applications are not subject to auctions 
if a renewal application is challenged  the fcc grants a preference commonly referred to as a license renewal expectancy to the applicant if the applicant can demonstrate that it has provided substantial service during the past license term and has substantially complied with applicable fcc rules and policies and the communications act 
the licenses for the mhz of spectrum in the ghz band that we received as part of the fcc s report and order  described below  have ten year terms and are not subject to specific build out conditions  but are subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our pcs licenses 
mhz and mhz license conditions spectrum in our mhz and mhz bands originally was licensed in small groups of channels  therefore we hold thousands of these licenses  which together allow us to provide coverage across much of the continental united states 
our mhz and mhz licenses are subject to requirements that we meet population coverage benchmarks tied to the initial license grant dates 
to date  we have met all of the construction requirements applicable to these licenses  except in the case of licenses that are not material to our business 
our mhz and mhz licenses have ten year terms  at the end of which each license is subject to renewal requirements that are similar to those for our ghz licenses 
spectrum reconfiguration obligations in  the fcc adopted a report and order that included new rules regarding interference in the mhz band and a comprehensive plan to reconfigure the mhz band the report and order 
the report and order provides for the exchange of a portion of our mhz fcc spectrum licenses  and requires us to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure the mhz spectrum band 
also  in exchange  we received licenses for mhz of nationwide spectrum in the ghz band  however  we were required to relocate and reimburse the incumbent licensees in this band for their costs of relocation to another band designated by the fcc 
our minimum cash obligation is approximately billion under the report and order 
we are  however  obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan  even if those costs exceed billion 
as required under the terms of the report and order  a letter of credit has been secured to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the mhz spectrum 
we submit the qualified mhz relocation costs to the fcc for review for potential letter of credit reductions on a periodic basis 
as a result of these reviews  our letter of credit was reduced from billion at the start of the project to billion as of december   as approved by the fcc 
completion of the mhz band reconfiguration was initially required by june  the fcc continues to grant mhz public safety licensees additional time to complete their band reconfigurations which  in turn  delays our access to some of our mhz replacement channels 
accordingly  we will continue to transition to our mhz replacement channels consistent with public safety licensees reconfiguration progress  however  we anticipate that continuing reconfiguration progress will be sufficient to support the mhz portion of our network 
table of contents vision rollout 
we completed all our of ghz incumbent relocation and reimbursement obligations in the second half of new spectrum opportunities and spectrum auctions several fcc proceedings and initiatives are underway that may affect the availability of spectrum used or useful in the provision of commercial wireless services  which may allow new competitors to enter the wireless market 
we cannot predict when or whether the fcc will conduct any spectrum auctions or if it will release additional spectrum that might be useful to wireless carriers  including us  in the future 
services pursuant to fcc rules  cmrs providers  including us  are required to provide enhanced e services in a two tiered manner 
specifically  wireless carriers are required to transmit to a requesting public safety answering point psap both the caller s telephone number and a the location of the cell site from which the call is being made  or b the location of the subscriber s handset using latitude and longitude  depending upon the capability of the psap 
implementation of e service must be completed within six months of a psap request for service in its area  or longer  based on the agreement between the individual psap and carrier 
the fcc has imposed increased location accuracy requirements on cmrs providers and we believe we will be able to continue to comply with those obligations 
national security national security and disaster recovery issues continue to receive attention at the federal  state and local levels 
for example  congress is considering cyber security legislation to increase the security and resiliency of the nation s digital infrastructure 
we cannot predict the cost impact of such legislation 
moreover  the fcc has re chartered the communications security  reliability and interoperability council  which consists of communications companies  public safety agencies and non profit consumer and community organizations to recommend to the fcc ways to ensure optimal security  reliability  and interoperability of communications systems 
we are a member of the council 
in addition  the fcc and the federal emergency management agency department of homeland security are likely to continue to focus on disaster preparedness and communications among first responders 
we have voluntarily agreed to provide wireless emergency alerts over our sprint platform 
although under the time line developed by the fcc  the provision of such alerts is to begin no later than april  we launched the wireless emergency alerting system on our network in november our subscribers with mobile phones equipped with the necessary software who live  work or visit new york city are able to receive wireless emergency alerts 
tower siting wireless systems must comply with various federal  state and local regulations that govern the siting  lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennas  including requirements imposed by the fcc and the federal aviation administration 
fcc rules subject certain cell site locations to extensive zoning  environmental and historic preservation requirements and mandate consultation with various parties  including state and tribal historic preservation offices 
the fcc rules govern historic preservation review of projects  which can make it more difficult and expensive to deploy antenna facilities 
the fcc has imposed a tower siting shot clock that requires local authorities to address tower applications within a specific timeframe  which can assist carriers in more rapid deployment of towers 
any changes to environmental protection and tower construction rules  however  would likely serve to delay construction and deployment of wireless systems  including network vision 
the fcc is assessing its antenna structure registration process in order to help address public notice requirements when plans are made for construction of  or modification to  antenna structures required to be registered with the fcc 
to the extent governmental agencies impose additional requirements like this on the tower siting process  the time and cost to construct cell towers could be negatively impacted 
state and local regulation while the communications act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating entry of  or the rates charged by  wireless carriers  certain state pucs and local governments regulate customer billing  termination of service arrangements  advertising  certification of operation  use of handsets when driving  service quality  sales practices  management of customer call records and protected information and many other areas 
also  some state attorneys general have become more active in bringing lawsuits related to the sales practices and services of wireless carriers 
varying practices among the states may make it more difficult for us to implement national sales 
table of contents and marketing programs 
states also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers  similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the fcc  and some states are requiring wireless carriers to help fund additional programs  including the implementation of e and the provision of intrastate relay services for consumers who are hearing impaired 
we anticipate that these trends will continue to require us to devote legal and other resources to work with the states to respond to their concerns while attempting to minimize any new regulation and enforcement actions that could increase our costs of doing business 
regulation and wireline operations competitive local service the telecommunications act of telecom act  which was the first comprehensive update of the communications act  was designed to promote competition  and it eliminated legal and regulatory barriers for entry into local and long distance communications markets 
it also required incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs to allow resale of specified local services at wholesale rates  negotiate interconnection agreements  provide nondiscriminatory access to certain unbundled network elements and allow co location of interconnection equipment by competitors 
the rules implementing the telecom act remain subject to legal challenges 
thus  the scope of future local competition remains uncertain 
these local competition rules impact us because we provide wholesale services to cable television companies that wish to compete in the local voice telephony market 
our communications and back office services enable the cable companies to provide competitive local and long distance telephone services primarily in a voip format to their end user customers 
voice over internet protocol we offer voip based services to business subscribers and transport voip originated traffic for various cable companies 
the fcc issued an order late last year reforming  among other things  its regulatory structure governing intercarrier compensation and again declined to classify voip services as either telecommunications services or information services 
however  it prescribed the rates applicable to the exchange of traffic between a voip provider and a local exchange carrier providing service on the public switched telephone network pstn 
the rate for toll voip pstn traffic will be the interstate access rate applicable to non voip traffic regardless of whether the traffic is interstate or intrastate 
the rate for non toll voip pstn traffic will be the applicable reciprocal compensation rate 
these rates will be reduced over the next several years as the industry transitions to bill and keep methodology for the exchange of all traffic 
providers of interconnected voip will continue to be required to contribute to the federal universal service fund usf  offer e emergency calling capabilities to their subscribers  and comply with the electronic surveillance obligations set forth in the communications assistance for law enforcement act calea 
because we provide voip services and transport voip originated traffic  the fcc s rate prescription decision is expected to reduce our costs for such traffic over time as well as reduce disputes between carriers that often result in litigation 
international regulation the wireline services we provide outside the united states are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of foreign governments and international bodies 
in general  we are required to obtain licenses to provide wireline services and comply with certain government requirements 
other regulations network neutrality on december   the fcc adopted so called net neutrality rules 
the fcc rules for fixed broadband internet access services consist of a an obligation to provide transparency to consumers regarding network management practices  performance characteristics  and commercial terms of service  b a prohibition on blocking access to lawful content  applications  services and devices  and c a prohibition on unreasonable discrimination 
the fcc acknowledged  however  that mobile broadband is in its early stages of development and is rapidly changing and accordingly adopted lesser obligations for mobile providers 
mobile providers must a provide transparency to consumers in the same manner as fixed providers  and b not block access to lawful websites and applications that compete with the provider s own voice or video telephony services 
other rules applicable to fixed broadband  including no blocking of other applications  services or devices  and the prohibition on unreasonable discrimination  do not apply to mobile providers 
because the net neutrality rules applicable to 
table of contents mobile broadband are relatively narrow and because we have deployed open mobile operating platforms on our devices  such as the android platform created in conjunction with google and the open handset alliance  the rules should not adversely affect the operation of our broadband networks or significantly constrain our ability to manage the networks and protect our users from harm caused by other users and devices 
truth in billing and consumer protection the fcc s truth in billing rules generally require both wireline and wireless telecommunications carriers  such as us  to provide full and fair disclosure of all charges on their bills  including brief  clear  and non misleading plain language descriptions of the services provided 
in response to a petition from the national association of state utility consumer advocates  the fcc found that state regulation of cmrs rates  including line items on consumer bills  is preempted by federal statute 
this decision was overturned by the th circuit court of appeals and the supreme court denied further appeal 
as a consequence  states may attempt to impose various regulations on the billing practices of wireless carriers 
in addition  the fcc has opened several proceedings to address issues of consumer protection  including the use of early termination fees  the fcc has opened an investigation into bill shock concerning overage charges for voice  data and text usage  and the fcc has proposed new rules to address cramming 
although the fcc has not imposed significant regulation in this area  the wireless industry has proactively addressed many of these consumer issues by adopting industry best practices such as the addition of free notifications for voice  data  messaging and international roaming to address the fcc s bill shock proceeding 
if these fcc proceedings or individual state proceedings create changes in the truth in billing rules  our billing and customer service costs could increase 
access charge reform ilecs and competitive local exchange carriers clecs impose access charges for the origination and termination of long distance calls upon wireless and long distance carriers  including our wireless and wireline segments 
also  interconnected local carriers  including our wireless segment  pay to each other reciprocal compensation fees for terminating interconnected local calls 
in addition  ilecs and clecs charge other carriers special access charges for access to dedicated facilities that are paid by both our wireless and wireline segments 
these fees and charges are a significant cost for our wireless and wireline segments 
in november  the fcc adopted comprehensive intercarrier compensation reforms  including a multi year transition to a system of bill and keep for terminating switched access charges 
these reforms are expected to decrease our terminating switched access expense over time 
in the november order  the fcc also adopted new rules requiring local exchange carriers lecs to lower their rates when they meet certain traffic pumping triggers 
traffic pumping occurs predominantly in rural exchanges that have very high access charges 
under traffic pumping arrangements  the lecs partner with other entities to offer free or almost free services such as conference calling and chat lines to end users  these services and payments to the lecs partners are financed through the assessment of high access charges on the end user s long distance or wireless carrier 
as a major wireless and wireline carrier  we have been assessed millions of dollars in access charges for pumped traffic 
the fcc s new rules are expected to help limit our exposure to these traffic pumping costs 
the fcc s special access rate proceeding remains open 
in the fall of  a trade association asked the dc court of appeals to direct the fcc to complete its special access investigation within six months 
the fcc opposed this request  noting that it had asked for additional information on special access rates  terms  and conditions in september we continue to advocate for special access reform but cannot predict when these proceedings will be completed or the outcome of these proceedings 
universal service reform communications carriers contribute to and receive support from various usfs established by the fcc and many states 
the federal usf program funds services provided in high cost areas  reduced rate services to low income consumers  and discounted communications and internet services for schools  libraries and rural health care facilities 
the usf is funded from assessments on communications providers  including our wireless and wireline segments  based on fcc prescribed contribution factors applicable to our interstate and international end user revenues from telecommunications services and interconnected voip services 
similarly  many states have established their own usfs to which we contribute 
the fcc is considering changing its usf contribution methodology  and may replace the interstate telecommunications revenue based assessment with one based on either 
table of contents connections telephone numbers or connections to the public network or by expanding the revenue base to include data revenues 
the latter approach in particular could impact the amount of our assessments 
the fcc is expected to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking on usf reform in the near future  but final action on the contribution methodology is not expected in the first half of as permitted  we assess subscribers a fee to recover our usf contributions 
in november  the fcc adopted rules reforming high cost usf support and transitioning from existing mechanisms to new funds which are focused on broadband deployment 
we are evaluating the relative costs and benefits of seeking support from the new mobility fund or connect america fund broadband usf programs 
in  sprint received approximately million in high cost usf support as an eligible telecommunications carrier etc 
pursuant to the fcc order authorizing the initial clearwire transaction  sprint is required to phase out its high cost usf support to zero by  and that process is currently being implemented on a state by state basis 
virgin mobile is designated as a lifeline only etc in jurisdictions  providing service under our assurance wireless brand  and has etc applications pending or planned in other jurisdictions as well 
virgin mobile s federal lifeline usf receipts increased substantially in and we anticipate them to continue to increase in the growth in the lifeline program has caused some regulators and legislators to question the structure of the current program and the fcc is continuing to review the growth of the program 
changes in the lifeline program as a result of the ongoing fcc proceeding or other legislation or regulations could negatively impact growth in the assurance wireless and wholesale subscriber base and or the profitability of the assurance wireless and wholesale business overall 
electronic surveillance obligations the calea requires telecommunications carriers  including us  to modify equipment  facilities and services to allow for authorized electronic surveillance based on either industry or fcc standards 
our calea obligations have been extended to data and voip networks  and we are in compliance with these requirements 
certain laws and regulations require that we assist various government agencies with electronic surveillance of communications and provide records concerning those communications 
we are a defendant in four purported class action lawsuits that allege that we participated in a program of intelligence gathering activities for the federal government following the terrorist attacks of september  that violated federal and state law 
relief sought in these cases includes injunctive relief  statutory and punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
we believe these suits have no merit  and they were dismissed by the district court 
the district court s decision was unanimously affirmed by a three judge panel of the ninth circuit 
we do not disclose customer information to the government or assist government agencies in electronic surveillance unless we have been provided a lawful request for such information 
environmental compliance our environmental compliance and remediation obligations relate primarily to the operation of standby power generators  batteries and fuel storage for our telecommunications equipment 
these obligations require compliance with storage and related standards  obtaining of permits and occasional remediation 
although we cannot assess with certainty the impact of any future compliance and remediation obligations  we do not believe that any such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
patents  trademarks and licenses we own numerous patents  patent applications  service marks  trademarks and other intellectual property in the united states and other countries  including sprint  nextel  direct connect  and boost mobile

table of contents item a 
risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us 
our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
if we are not able to retain and attract wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired 
we are in the business of selling communications services to subscribers  and our economic success is based on our ability to retain current subscribers and attract new subscribers 
if we are unable to retain and attract wireless subscribers  our financial performance will be impaired  and we could fail to meet our financial obligations  which could result in several outcomes  including controlling investments by third parties  takeover bids  liquidation of assets or insolvency 
beginning in through  we experienced decreases in our total retail postpaid subscriber base of approximately million subscribers excluding the impact of our acquisitions  while our two largest competitors increased their subscribers during that period 
in addition  our average postpaid churn rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively  while our two largest competitors had churn rates that were substantially lower 
although we have begun to see a reduction in our net loss of postpaid subscribers  if this trend does not continue our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
our ability to retain our existing subscribers and to compete successfully for new subscribers and reduce our rate of churn depends on our successful execution of marketing and sales strategies  including the acceptance of our value proposition  service delivery and customer care activities  including new account set up and billing  and our credit and collection policies  clearwire s ability to successfully obtain additional financing for the continued operation and build out of its g networks  our ability to access clearwire s spectrum  the successful deployment and completion of our network modernization plan  network vision  including a multi mode network infrastructure  successful lte implementation and deployment  and push to talk capabilities of comparable quality to our existing nextel platform push to talk capabilities  our ability to mitigate churn as we migrate nextel platform push to talk subscribers to other offerings on our sprint platform  which include future offerings on our multi mode network  such as sprint direct connect  actual or perceived quality and coverage of our networks  including clearwire s g network  public perception about our brands  our ability to anticipate and develop new or enhanced technologies  products and services that are attractive to existing or potential subscribers  our ability to access additional spectrum  including through spectrum hosting arrangements  our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry  including new technologies  products and services that may be introduced by our competitors  changes in consumer preferences  demographic trends  economic conditions  and discount pricing and other strategies that may be implemented by our competitors  and our ability to maintain our current mvnos and to enter into new arrangements with mvnos 
our recent success in attracting more postpaid subscribers and reducing postpaid churn may also not be sustainable 
our ability to retain subscribers may be negatively affected by industry trends related to subscriber contracts 
for example  we and our competitors no longer require subscribers to renew their contracts when making changes to their pricing plans 
these types of changes could negatively affect our ability to retain subscribers and could lead to an increase in our churn rates if we are not successful in providing an attractive product and service mix 
moreover  service providers frequently offer wireless equipment  such as devices  below acquisition cost as a method to retain and attract subscribers that enter into wireless service agreements for periods usually extending 
table of contents to months 
equipment cost in excess of the revenue generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy and is generally recognized when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user subscriber 
the cost of multi functional devices  such as smartphones  including the iphone  has increased significantly in recent years as a result of enhanced capabilities and functionality 
at the same time  wireless service providers continue to compete on the basis of price  including the price of devices offered to subscribers  which has resulted in increased equipment net subsidy 
we have entered into a purchase commitment with apple  inc that increases the average equipment net subsidy for postpaid devices resulting in a reduction to consolidated results from operations and reduced cash flow from operations associated with initiation of service for these devices until such time that retail service revenues associated with customers acquiring these devices exceeds such costs 
we expect to incur expenses to attract new subscribers  improve subscriber retention and reduce churn  but there can be no assurance that our efforts will result in new subscribers or a lower rate of subscriber churn 
subscriber losses and a high rate of churn adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations because they result in lost revenues and cash flow 
although attracting new subscribers and retention of existing subscribers are important to the financial viability of our business  there is an added focus on retention because the cost of adding a new subscriber is higher than the cost associated with retention of an existing subscriber 
as the wireless market matures  we must increasingly seek to attract subscribers from competitors and face increased credit risk from new postpaid wireless subscribers 
we and our competitors increasingly must seek to attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from each other s existing subscriber bases rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services 
beginning in through  we experienced decreases in our total retail postpaid subscriber base of approximately million subscribers excluding the impact of our acquisitions  while our two largest competitors increased their subscribers over the same period 
in addition  the higher market penetration also means that subscribers purchasing postpaid wireless services for the first time  on average  have lower credit scores than existing wireless subscribers  and the number of these subscribers we are willing to accept is dependent on our credit policies  which are less stringent than our investment grade competitors 
to the extent we cannot compete effectively for new subscribers or if they are not creditworthy  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected 
competition and technological changes in the market for wireless services could negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber  subscriber churn  operating costs and our ability to attract new subscribers  resulting in adverse effects on our revenues  future cash flows  growth and profitability 
we compete with a number of other wireless service providers in each of the markets in which we provide wireless services  and we expect competition may increase if additional spectrum is made available for commercial wireless services and as new technologies are developed and launched 
as competition among wireless communications providers has increased  we have created certain unlimited pricing plans that may result in increased usage of data on our network 
competition in pricing and service and product offerings may also adversely impact subscriber retention and our ability to attract new subscribers  with adverse effects on our results of operations 
a decline in the average revenue per subscriber coupled with a decline in the number of subscribers would negatively impact our revenues  future cash flows  growth and overall profitability  which  in turn  could impact our ability to meet our financial obligations 
the wireless communications industry is experiencing significant technological change  including improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology and the deployment of unlicensed spectrum devices 
this change causes uncertainty about future subscriber demand for our wireless services and the prices that we will be able to charge for these services 
spending by our competitors on new wireless services and network improvements could enable our competitors to obtain a competitive advantage with new technologies or enhancements that we do not offer 
rapid change in technology may lead to the development of wireless communications technologies  products or alternative services that are superior to our technologies  products  or services or that consumers prefer over ours 
if we are unable to meet future advances in competing technologies on a timely basis  or at an acceptable cost  we may not be able to compete effectively and could lose subscribers to our competitors 
some competitors and new entrants may be able to offer subscribers network features or products and services not offered by us  coverage in areas not served by our wireless networks or pricing plans that are lower than 
table of contents those offered by us  all of which would negatively affect our average revenue per subscriber  subscriber churn  ability to attract new subscribers  and operating costs 
for example  our prepaid services compete with several carriers  including metro pcs and leap wireless  which offer competitively priced prepaid calling plans that include unlimited long distance  texting and  in some cases  unlimited data including g 
in addition  we may lose subscribers of our higher priced plans to our prepaid offerings 
the success of our network modernization plan  network vision  will depend on the timing  extent and cost of implementation  the performance of third parties and related parties  upgrade requirements  and the availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such modernization 
we must continually invest in our wireless network in order to continually improve our wireless service to meet the increasing demand for usage of our data and other non voice services and remain competitive 
improvements in our service depend on many factors  including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum 
we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage as well as the associated wireline network needed to transport voice and data between cell sites 
if we are unable to obtain access to additional spectrum to increase capacity or to deploy the services subscribers desire on a timely basis or at acceptable costs while maintaining network quality levels  our ability to retain and attract subscribers could be materially adversely affected  which would negatively impact our operating margins 
we are implementing network vision  which is a multi year infrastructure initiative intended to reduce operating costs and provide subscribers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality  coverage and data speeds  while enhancing network flexibility and improving environmental sustainability 
the focus of the plan is on upgrading the existing sprint platform and providing flexibility for new g technologies  including lte 
if network vision does not provide a competitive lte network  an enhanced network experience  or is unable to provide sprint platform push to talk capabilities of comparable quality to the push to talk capabilities of our existing nextel platform or our competitors similar services  our ability to provide enhanced wireless services to our subscribers  to retain and attract subscribers  and to maintain and grow our subscriber revenues could be adversely affected 
using a new and sophisticated technology on a very large scale entails risks 
for example  deployment of new technology  including lte  may adversely affect the performance of existing services on our networks 
should implementation of our upgraded network be delayed or costs exceed expected amounts  our margins would be adversely affected and such effects could be material 
should the delivery of services expected to be deployed on our upgraded network be delayed due to technological constraints  performance of third party suppliers  zoning and leasing restrictions or permit issues  or other reasons  the cost of providing such services could become higher than expected  which could result in higher costs to customers  potentially resulting in decisions to purchase services from our competitors which would adversely affect our revenues  profitability and cash flow from operations 
we plan to migrate existing nextel platform subscribers to other offerings on our sprint platform  including future offerings on our multi mode network  such as sprint direct connect 
the successful deployment and market acceptance of network vision is expected to result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including  but not limited to  an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets  due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets  and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations 
our ability to transition subscribers from the nextel platform to offerings on the sprint platform is dependent  in part  upon the success of sprint direct connect and subscriber satisfaction with this technology 
failure to complete development  testing and deployment of new technology that supports new services  including lte  could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
the deployment of new technology and new service offerings could result in network degradation or the loss of subscribers 
in addition  the technology we currently use  including wimax  may place us at a competitive disadvantage 
we develop  test and deploy various new technologies and support systems intended to enhance our competitiveness by both supporting new services and features and reducing the costs associated with providing those services 
successful development and implementation of technology upgrades depend  in part  on the willingness of third parties to develop new applications or devices in a timely manner 
we may not successfully complete the development and rollout of new technology and related features or services in a timely manner  and they may not be widely accepted by our subscribers or may not be profitable  in which case we could not recover our investment in 
table of contents the technology 
deployment of technology supporting new service offerings may also adversely affect the performance or reliability of our networks with respect to both the new and existing services and may require us to take action like curtailing new subscribers in certain markets 
any resulting subscriber dissatisfaction could affect our ability to retain subscribers and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and growth prospects 
our wireless networks currently provide services utilizing cdma and iden technologies 
wireless subscribers served by these two technologies represent a smaller portion of global wireless subscribers than the subscribers served by wireless networks that utilize global system for mobile communications gsm technology 
as a result  our costs with respect to both cdma and iden network equipment and devices may continue to be higher than the comparable costs incurred by our competitors who use gsm technology  which places us at a competitive disadvantage 
see the success of our network modernization plan  network vision  will depend on the timing  extent and cost of implementation  the performance of third parties and related parties  upgrade requirements  and the availability and reliability of the various technologies required to provide such modernization 
we have expended significant resources and made substantial investments to deploy a g mobile broadband network through our equity method investment in clearwire using wimax technology 
as part of network vision  we announced that we currently intend to continue selling wimax devices through and that we expect to continue to support such devices for a period of time after that  as we transition to lte 
the failure to successfully design  build and deploy our lte network  or a loss of or inability to access clearwire s spectrum could increase subscriber losses  increase our costs of providing services or increase our churn 
other competing technologies may have advantages over our current or planned technology and operators of other networks based on those competing technologies may be able to deploy these alternative technologies at a lower cost and more quickly than the cost and speed with which clearwire provides g mvno services to us or with which we deploy our lte network  which may allow those operators to compete more effectively or may require us and clearwire to deploy additional technologies 
see risks related to our investment in clearwire below for additional risks related to our investment in clearwire and the operation of its g network 
current economic and market conditions  our recent financial performance  our high debt levels  and our debt ratings could negatively impact our access to the capital markets resulting in less growth than planned or failure to satisfy financial covenants under our existing debt agreements 
we expect to incur additional debt in the future for a variety of reasons  such as network vision and working capital needs  including equipment net subsidies  future investments or acquisitions 
our ability to arrange additional financing will depend on  among other factors  current economic and market conditions  our financial performance  our high debt levels  and our debt ratings 
some of these factors are beyond our control  and we may not be able to arrange additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
failure to obtain suitable financing when needed could  among other things  result in our inability to continue to expand our businesses and meet competitive challenges  including implementation of network vision on our current timeline 
the continued instability in the global financial markets has resulted in periodic volatility in the credit  equity and fixed income markets 
this volatility could limit our access to the credit markets  leading to higher borrowing costs or  in some cases  the inability to obtain financing on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
we have incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to finance operations and other general corporate purposes 
we expect to incur additional amounts of indebtedness in the future  which may be substantial 
at december   the carrying value of our total debt was approximately billion 
as a result  we are highly leveraged and will continue to be highly leveraged 
accordingly  our debt service requirements are significant in relation to our revenues and cash flow 
this leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our businesses whether through competitive pressures or otherwise  in our industry or in the economy generally  and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively  particularly with respect to competitors that are less leveraged 
the debt ratings for our notes are currently below the investment grade category  which results in higher borrowing costs than investment grade debt as well as reduced marketability of our debt 
our debt ratings could be further downgraded for various reasons  including if we incur significant additional indebtedness  or if we do not generate sufficient cash from our operations  which would likely increase our future borrowing costs and could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital 

table of contents our credit facility  which expires in october  requires that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items as defined by the credit facility adjusted ebitda  of no more than to  as of any fiscal quarter ending on or before march  the ratio will be reduced to to after march   and further reduced to to after december  as of december   the ratio was to if we do not continue to satisfy this ratio  we will be in default under our credit facility  which would trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated 
while we recently amended our credit facility to redefine adjusted ebitda by adding back certain net equipment costs  there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with the covenant as modified or that  if needed  we can obtain amendments or waivers in the future 
we also have an unsecured loan agreement with export development canada edc  which has terms similar to those of our credit facility 
in addition to the covenants in our credit facility and the edc loan  certain indentures  governing our notes limit  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends  create liens and sell  transfer  lease or dispose of assets 
such restrictions could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets or engage in certain transactions 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may not reflect our actual operations and performance 
market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operations and performance 
stock price volatility and sustained decreases in our share price could subject our shareholders to losses and us to takeover bids or lead to action by the nyse 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  subject to fluctuations in price in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including  but not limited to quarterly announcements and variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  either alone or in comparison to analysts expectations or prior company estimates  including announcements of subscriber counts  rates of churn  and operating margins that would result in downward pressure on our stock price  the cost and availability or perceived availability of additional capital and market perceptions relating to our access to this capital  seasonality or other variations in our subscriber base  including our rate of churn  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  new products  technologies  significant contracts  commercial relationships or capital commitments  the performance of clearwire and clearwire s class a common stock or speculation about the possibility of future actions we or other significant shareholders may take in connection with clearwire  disruption to our operations or those of other companies critical to our network operations  market speculation or announcements by us regarding the entering into  or termination of  material transactions  our ability to develop and market new and enhanced technologies  products and services on a timely and cost effective basis  including implementation of network vision and our networks  recommendations by securities analysts or changes in their estimates concerning us  the incurrence of additional debt  dilutive issuances of our stock  short sales or hedging of  and other derivative transactions  in our common stock  any significant change in our board of directors or management  litigation  changes in governmental regulations or approvals  and perceptions of general market conditions in the technology and communications industries  the us economy and global market conditions 

table of contents consolidation and competition in the wholesale market for wireline services  as well as consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers used for wireless services  could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our wireline segment competes with at t  verizon communications  centurylink  level communications inc  other major local incumbent operating companies  and cable operators  as well as a host of smaller competitors 
some of these companies have high capacity  ip based fiber optic networks capable of supporting large amounts of voice and data traffic 
some of these companies claim certain cost structure advantages that  among other factors  may allow them to offer services at lower prices than we can 
in addition  consolidation by these companies could lead to fewer companies controlling access to more cell sites  enabling them to control usage and rates  which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
we provide wholesale services under long term contracts to cable television operators which enable these operators to provide consumer and business digital telephone services 
these contracts may not be renewed as they expire 
increased competition and the significant increase in capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may drive already low prices down further 
at t and verizon communications continue to be our two largest competitors in the domestic long distance communications market 
we and other long distance carriers depend heavily on local access facilities obtained from ilecs to serve our long distance subscribers  and payments to ilecs for these facilities are a significant cost of service for our wireline segment 
the long distance operations of at t and verizon communications have cost and operational advantages with respect to these access facilities because those carriers serve significant geographic areas  including many large urban areas  as the ilec 
in addition  our wireless segment could be adversely affected by changes in rates and access fees that result from consolidation of our roaming partners and access providers  which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability 
the blurring of the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services contributes to increased competition 
the traditional dividing lines among long distance  local  wireless  video and internet services are increasingly becoming blurred 
through mergers  joint ventures and various service expansion strategies  major providers are striving to provide integrated services in many of the markets we serve 
this trend is also reflected in changes in the regulatory environment that have encouraged competition and the offering of integrated services 
we expect competition to intensify as a result of the entrance of new competitors or the expansion of services offered by existing competitors  and the rapid development of new technologies  products and services 
we cannot predict which of many possible future technologies  products  or services will be important to maintain our competitive position or what expenditures we will be required to make in order to develop and provide these technologies  products or services 
to the extent we do not keep pace with technological advances or fail to timely respond to changes in the competitive environment affecting our industry  we could lose market share or experience a decline in revenue  cash flows and net income 
as a result of the financial strength and benefits of scale enjoyed by some of our competitors  they may be able to offer services at lower prices than we can  thereby adversely affecting our revenues  growth and profitability 
if we are unable to improve our results of operations  we face the possibility of additional charges for impairments of long lived assets 
further  our future operating results will be impacted by our share of clearwire s net loss  which will likely negatively affect our results of operations 
the carrying value of our investment in clearwire may be subject to further impairment 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if we continue to have operational challenges  including obtaining and retaining subscribers  our future cash flows may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our long lived assets  and we could record asset impairments that are material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
if we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we assess the deployment of network vision  management may conclude  in future periods  that certain equipment assets will never be either deployed or redeployed  in which case additional cash and or non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized 
we account for our investment in clearwire using the equity method of accounting and  as a result  we record our share of clearwire s net income or net loss  which could adversely affect our consolidated results of 
table of contents operations 
clearwire reported that it will need substantial additional capital over the intermediate and long term 
clearwire s ability  however  to raise sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all  remains uncertain 
in addition  clearwire reported that if it fails to obtain additional capital  its business prospects  financial condition and results of operations will likely be materially and adversely affected  and it will be forced to consider all available alternatives 
additional declines in the value of clearwire may require us to evaluate the decline in relation to the carrying value of our investment in clearwire 
a conclusion by us that additional declines in the value of clearwire are other than temporary could result in an additional impairment  which could be material 
we have entered into agreements with unrelated parties for certain business operations 
any difficulties experienced in these arrangements could result in additional expense  loss of subscribers and revenue  interruption of our services or a delay in the roll out of new technology 
we have entered into agreements with unrelated parties for the day to day execution of services  provisioning and maintenance for our wireless and wireline networks  for the implementation of network vision  and for the development and maintenance of certain software systems necessary for the operation of our business 
we also have agreements with unrelated parties to provide customer service and related support to our wireless subscribers and outsourced aspects of our wireline network and back office functions to unrelated parties 
in addition  we have sublease agreements with unrelated parties for space on communications towers 
as a result  we must rely on unrelated parties to perform certain of our operations and  in certain circumstances  interface with our subscribers 
if these unrelated parties were unable to perform to our requirements  we would have to pursue alternative strategies to provide these services and that could result in delays  interruptions  additional expenses and loss of subscribers 
the products and services utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others 
some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products from suppliers  including device suppliers  and outsource services to service providers  including billing and customer care functions  that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products or software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
these claims can be time consuming and costly to defend  and divert management resources 
if these claims are successful  we could be forced to pay significant damages or stop selling certain products or services or stop using certain trademarks  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
government regulation could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations  the fcc and state regulatory commissions may adopt new regulations or take other actions that could adversely affect our business prospects  future growth or results of operations 
the fcc and other federal  state and local  as well as international  governmental authorities have jurisdiction over our business and could adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects or results of operations 
the licensing  construction  operation  sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems are regulated by the fcc and  depending on the jurisdiction  international  state and local regulatory agencies 
in particular  the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees  the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered  and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands 
the fcc grants wireless licenses for terms of generally ten years that are subject to renewal and revocation 
there is no guarantee that our licenses will be renewed 
failure to comply with fcc requirements in a given license area could result in revocation of the license for that license area 
depending on their outcome  the fcc s proceedings regarding regulation of special access rates could affect the rates paid by our wireless and wireline segments for special access services in the future 
similarly  depending on their outcome  the fcc s proceedings on the regulatory classification of voip services could affect the intercarrier compensation rates and the level of usf contributions paid by us 

table of contents various states are considering regulations over terms and conditions of service  including certain billing practices and consumer related issues that may not be pre empted by federal law 
if imposed  these regulations could make it more difficult and expensive to implement national sales and marketing programs and could increase the costs of our wireless operations 
degradation in network performance caused by compliance with government regulation  such as net neutrality  loss of spectrum or additional rules associated with the use of spectrum in any market could result in an inability to attract new subscribers or higher subscriber churn in that market  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  additional costs or fees imposed by governmental regulation could adversely affect our revenues  future growth and results of operations 
proposed regulatory developments regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products  including handsets 
although we do not buy raw materials  manufacture  or produce any electronic equipment directly  the proposed regulation may affect some of our suppliers 
as a result  there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  because our supply chain is complex  we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell 
changes to the federal lifeline assistance program could negatively impact the growth of the assurance wireless and wholesale subscriber base and the profitability of the assurance wireless and wholesale business overall 
virgin mobile usa  lp  our wholly owned subsidiary  offers service to low income subscribers eligible for the federal lifeline assistance program under the brand assurance wireless brought to you by virgin mobile  which we refer to as assurance wireless 
assurance wireless provides a monthly discount to eligible subscribers in the form of a free block of minutes 
moreover  some of our wholesale customers also offer service to subscribers eligible for the federal lifeline assistance program 
this discount is subsidized by the low cost program of the federal usf and administered by the universal service administrative company 
lifeline service is offered by both wireline and wireless companies  but more recent wireless entry  particularly by prepaid carriers with a focus on lower income consumers  has caused a rapid increase in the amount of usf support directed toward the lifeline program 
the fcc recently adopted reforms to the low income program to increase program effectiveness and efficiencies 
more stringent eligibility and certification requirements will make it more difficult for all lifeline service providers to sign up and retain lifeline subscribers 
the growth in the lifeline program has caused some regulators and legislators to question the structure of the current program and the fcc is continuing to review the growth of the program 
changes in the lifeline program as a result of the ongoing fcc proceeding or other legislation could negatively impact growth in the assurance wireless and wholesale subscriber base and or the profitability of the assurance wireless and wholesale business overall 
if our business partners and subscribers fail to meet their contractual obligations it could negatively affect our results of operations 
the current economic environment has made it difficult for businesses and consumers to obtain credit  which could cause our suppliers  distributors and subscribers to have problems meeting their contractual obligations with us 
if our suppliers are unable to fulfill our orders or meet their contractual obligations with us  we may not have the services or devices available to meet the needs of our current and future subscribers  which could cause us to lose current and potential subscribers to other carriers 
in addition  if our distributors are unable to stay in business  we could lose distribution points  which could negatively affect our business and results of operations 
finally  if our subscribers are unable to pay their bills or potential subscribers feel they are unable to take on additional financial obligations  they may be forced to forgo our services  which could negatively affect our results of operations 
our reputation and business may be harmed and we may be subject to legal claims if there is loss  disclosure or misappropriation of or access to our subscribers or our own information or other breaches of our information security

any loss  disclosure or misappropriation of  or access to  subscribers information or other breach of our information security can result in legal claims or proceedings  including regulatory investigations and actions  may have an adverse impact on our reputation and may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business could be negatively impacted by threats and other disruptions 
major equipment failures  natural disasters  including severe weather  terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security that affect our wireline and wireless networks  including transport facilities  communications switches  routers  microwave links  cell sites or other equipment or third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these events could disrupt our operations  require significant resources  result in a loss of subscribers or impair our ability to attract new subscribers  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
concerns about health risks associated with wireless equipment may reduce the demand for our services 
portable communications devices have been alleged to have adverse health affects  due to radio frequency emissions from these devices 
the actual or perceived risk of using mobile communications devices could adversely affect us through a reduction in subscribers  reduced network usage per subscriber or reduced financing available to the mobile communications industry 
although the fda and fcc have both noted that the weight of the scientific evidence does not link cell phone use to cancer or any health problems  further research and studies are ongoing  we have no reason to expect those studies to reach a different conclusion  but we cannot guarantee that additional studies will not demonstrate a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview business strategies and key priorities sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers  businesses  government subscribers and resellers 
the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of the quality of service  the types of services and devices offered  and price 
as discussed below in effects on our wireless business of postpaid subscriber losses  the company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical postpaid wireless market since the third quarter  but  as a result of steps taken to retain and attract such subscribers  has reduced annual postpaid net subscriber losses beginning in our business strategy is to be responsive to changing customer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace 
our future growth plans and strategy revolve around achieving the following three key priorities improve the customer experience  strengthen our brands  and generate operating cash flow 
we have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our simply everything and everything data plans and our any mobile anytime feature 
we also offer price plans tailored to business subscribers such as business advantage  which allows for the flexibility to mix and match plans that include voice  voice and messaging  or voice  messaging and data to meet individual business needs and also allows the any mobile anytime feature with certain plans

for our business customers  we aim to increase their productivity by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining ip networks with wireless technology 
this differentiation enables us to retain and acquire both wireline  wireless and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks 
we have also continued to focus on further improving customer care 
we implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures  and standardized our performance measures through various metrics  including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care  first call resolution  and calls per subscriber 
our product strategy is to provide our customers with a broad array of device selections and applications and services that run on these devices to meet the growing needs of customer mobility 
our multi functional device portfolio includes many cutting edge devices from various original equipment manufacturers oems 
our mobile broadband portfolio consists of devices such as hotspots  which allow the connection of multiple wifi enabled devices 
our networks can also be accessed through our portfolio of embedded tablets and laptop devices 
we support the open development of applications  content and devices on our network platforms through products and services such as google voice as well as google wallet  which is an application using near field communication technology to enable smartphones to make purchases at select merchants 
we have also launched multiple sprint id packs that download applications  widgets and other content related to a person s interests at the push of a button 
in addition  we enable a variety of business and consumer third party relationships through our portfolio of machine to machine solutions  which we offer on a retail postpaid and wholesale basis 
the machine to machine solutions portfolio provides a secure  real time and reliable wireless two way data connection across a broad range of connected devices including oem devices and after market in vehicle connectivity and electric vehicle charging stations  point of sale systems  kiosks and vending machines  asset tracking  digital signage  security  smartgrid utilities  medical equipment  and a variety of other consumer electronics and appliances 
our prepaid portfolio includes multiple brands  each designed to appeal to specific customer segments 
boost mobile serves subscribers who are voice and text messaging centric with its popular monthly unlimited plan with shrinkage service where bills are reduced after six on time payments 
virgin mobile serves subscribers who are device and data oriented with beyond talk plans and our broadband plan  broadbandgo  that offer consumers control  flexibility  and connectivity through various communication vehicles

we have focused our wholesale business to enable our diverse network of customers to successfully grow their business by providing them with an array of network  product  and device solutions 
this allows our customers to customize this full suite of value added solutions to meet the growing demands of their business 
in addition to our brand and customer oriented goals  we continue to focus on generating increased operating cash flow through competitive rate plans for postpaid and prepaid subscribers  multi branded strategies  and effectively managing our cost structure to align with reduced revenues from fewer postpaid subscribers 
certain of our strategic decisions  such as network vision and the introduction of the iphone  which on average carries a higher equipment net subsidy  will result in a reduction in cash flows from operations in the near term 
however  we believe these actions will generate long term benefits  including growth in valuable postpaid subscribers  a reduction in variable cost of service per unit and long term accretion to cash flows from operations 
see liquidity and capital resources for more information 
network vision in december  we announced network vision  a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide subscribers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality  coverage  and data speeds  while enhancing network flexibility  reducing operating costs  and improving environmental sustainability through the utilization of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station 
in addition to implementing these multi mode base stations  this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode chipsets into smartphones  tablets and other broadband devices  including machine to machine products 
through the successful deployment of network vision  we expect to migrate to a single nationwide network allowing for the consolidation and optimization of our megahertz mhz and gigahertz ghz spectrum  as well as other spectrum owned by third parties  into multi mode stations allowing us to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage  particularly around the in building experience 
the multi mode technology also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility  which also allows for the deployment of lte 
the first stages of equipment testing began in the first quarter of  and we have achieved our initial technical milestones 
deployment has begun on approximately  cell sites  and we powered on our first multi mode base station on december  we expect to commercially launch this new technology in certain markets by mid year on october   we launched sprint direct connect  which is the next generation of push to talk technology 
further deployments of network vision technology  including enhancements of sprint direct connect  are expected to continue through early we expect the plan to bring financial benefit to the company through migration to one common network  which is expected to reduce network maintenance and operating costs through capital efficiencies  reduced energy costs  lower roaming expenses  backhaul savings  and the eventual reduction in total cell sites 
the successful deployment related to these changes in technology will result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including  but not limited to  an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets  both nextel and sprint platform related  due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets  and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations  which we expect will have a material impact on our results of operations 
we recorded a charge of million related to network equipment  which has not been placed into service and that is no longer necessary for management s strategic plans 
in the first quarter of  we formalized our plans to decommission roughly one third of our total nextel platform  or  towers  by the end of we also expect to be completed with our transition of customers from the nextel platform to our sprint platform by the end of  which should allow us to decommission the remainder of our nextel platform sites 
as a result  in the first quarter  we revised our estimates of the expected useful lives of certain nextel platform assets and asset retirement obligations through the end of accordingly  approximately billion of the remaining billion net book value of nextel platform assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense  of which a disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during the exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service 
these estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan  which is still evolving 
we estimate the incremental effect of accelerated depreciation related to nextel platform assets in our results to be in the range of approximately billion to billion 

table of contents in addition  we are experiencing increased data usage by subscribers  which has required additional capital expenditures of data capacity equipment on our current sprint platform 
as we deploy network vision  we intend to maximize the use of previously deployed data capacity equipment when possible  however  based on our capacity needs during the implementation period of network vision  we expect additional data capacity expenditures that will not be compatible with the deployment of network vision s multi mode technology 
as a result  the estimated useful lives of such equipment will be shortened  as compared to similar prior capital expenditures  through the date in which network vision equipment is deployed and in service 
spectrum hosting our network vision multi mode network technology is designed to utilize a single base station capable of handling various spectrum bands  including our mhz and ghz spectrum as well as spectrum bands owned or accessed by other parties 
in june  we entered into a year arrangement with lightsquared lp and lightsquared inc collectively  lightsquared 
under the terms of the arrangement  and in conjunction with our network vision deployment  we agreed to deploy and operate an lte network capable of utilizing the ghz spectrum licensed to or available to lightsquared during the term of the arrangement  a service we refer to as spectrum hosting 
the arrangement contains contingencies related to possible interference issues with lightsquared s spectrum  including the right of sprint to terminate the arrangement if certain conditions are not met by lightsquared 
as of december   the company had received million of advanced payments from lightsquared for future services to be performed under the spectrum hosting agreement 
beginning in december  through a series of amendments  the arrangement was modified to  among other things  extend the date in which sprint has the right to terminate the arrangement and suspend sprint s obligation to incur any further cost or expense related to performance under the original agreement 
under the amended arrangement  sprint  for any reason  including but not limited to fcc action or inaction  or no reason at all  may terminate the agreement after march  and before april  if lightsquared secures lender s consent for modifications to the agreement  sprint s right to terminate will be deferred until june  and will continue through december  in addition  the parties definitively agreed that approximately million of the total million of advanced payments made by lightsquared represent payment for incremental costs or obligations incurred by sprint under the original agreement in support of lightsquared 
the parties agreed that this amount is irrevocably and unconditionally paid and will not be subject to dispute or claim by lightsquared 
accordingly  sprint will refund up to approximately million of lightsquared s initial prepayments  of which million will be paid on the earlier of lightsquared s lender s consent or march   and the remaining million will remain subject to the termination and unwind provisions of the original agreement and will be returned to lightsquared upon termination  less any additional incremental cost or obligations incurred by sprint in support of lightsquared 
in the event the arrangement is terminated for lightsquared s material breach  non payment or insolvency  sprint maintains a second lien on certain of lightsquared s assets  including spectrum assets 
the million  which has been recorded as a current liability  will be recognized as other operating income  net of the associated costs  in the event of termination assuming all other uncertainties have been resolved 
alternatively  should sprint and lightsquared agree to proceed with the hosting arrangement  the million will be recognized as revenue as the hosting services are performed 
effects on our wireless business of postpaid subscriber losses the following table shows annual net additions losses of postpaid subscribers by platform for the past five years  excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations 
year ended december  in thousands sprint platform net additions losses nextel platform net losses total net losses of postpaid subscribers as shown by the table below under results of operations  wireless segment earnings represented approximately of our total consolidated segment earnings in the wireless industry is subject to competition to retain and acquire subscribers of wireless services 
most markets in which we operate have high rates 
table of contents of penetration for wireless services 
wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers 
within the wireless segment  postpaid wireless services represent the most significant contributors to earnings  and are driven by the number of postpaid subscribers to our services  as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user arpu 
to address and reduce net postpaid subscriber losses  we have taken initiatives to strengthen the sprint brand and continue to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience  including the speed and dependability of our networks 
we have also introduced new devices  including the iphone in the fourth quarter of  improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive portfolio for customer selection  as well as competitive rate plans providing simplicity and value 
the company has significantly improved net postpaid subscriber results subsequent to the first quarter as a result of actions taken to improve customer service  device selection and value oriented service offerings 
in conjunction with network vision  the company continues to focus on the growth of the sprint platform while simultaneously targeting retention of nextel platform customers through competitive offerings on the sprint platform  which includes sprint direct connect 
as a result of our plans  we expect that customer churn on the nextel platform  both postpaid and prepaid  will increase as we progress toward the decommissioning of the nextel platform as well as increased competition for these subscribers 
although the company continues to experience net losses of nextel platform postpaid subscribers  these subscribers generally have a lower arpu and have been partially offset by net additions of sprint platform postpaid subscribers which  on average  carry a higher arpu 
for the year ended december   net postpaid subscriber losses of  represent an improvement of  or compared to the same period one year ago and net prepaid subscriber additions of million represent an improvement of  or compared to the same period one year ago 
wireless retail service revenue has begun to grow primarily due to the increased service revenue associated with our prepaid wireless offerings and increased postpaid arpu due primarily to the premium data add on charge associated with smartphones 
if our trend of improved postpaid subscriber results does not continue  it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity in and beyond 
the company believes the actions that have been taken  as described above  and that continue to be taken in marketing  customer service  device offerings  and network quality  should continue to improve net postpaid subscriber results

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense during  sprint completed studies of the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets  which reflects a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions and was a primary factor for a decrease to depreciation expense of million  or  in compared to this decline is partially offset by an increase due to assets placed in service as a result of capital expenditures related to capacity to support increased data usage by our subscribers 
as a result of expected increased capital expenditures related to network vision  we expect depreciation expense to increase over the next several years as those assets are placed in service 
in addition  the successful deployment related to the changes in technology as a result of network vision is expected to result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including  but not limited to  an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets  both nextel and sprint platform related  due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets  and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations  which we expect to have a material impact on our results of operations 
depreciation expense decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions resulting from reduced capital spending associated with our cost control actions beginning in the average annual capital expenditures for the three years ended were approximately billion as compared to average annual capital expenditures of billion for the three years ended amortization expense declined million  or  in compared to primarily due to the absence of amortization for customer relationship intangible assets related to the acquisition of nextel  which became fully amortized in the second quarter in addition  customer relationship intangible assets related to the acquisition of nextel partners  inc in and virgin mobile usa  inc virgin mobile in the fourth quarter became fully amortized in the second quarter amortization expense declined million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to the absence of amortization for customer relationship intangible assets related to the acquisition of nextel which became fully amortized in the second quarter these reductions were partially offset by an increase in amortization related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the ipcs  inc ipcs and virgin mobile acquisitions in the fourth quarter customer relationships are amortized using the sum of the years digits method  resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time

the costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our devices  referred to as equipment net subsidies  as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers 
network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs  which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers 
the remaining costs associated with operating the wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support 
wireless service revenue  costs to acquire subscribers  and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage  but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with these changes 
wireless segment earnings have declined consecutively for each of the annual periods ending december   and wireless segment earnings were approximately billion  billion and billion for each of the twelve month periods ended december   and  respectively

service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges  variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees  directory assistance  roaming  equipment protection  late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees  net of service credits 
the ability of our wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of revenue generated from each subscriber  which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services  and the number of subscribers that we serve  which in turn is a function of our ability to retain existing and acquire new subscribers 
retail comprises those subscribers to whom sprint directly provides wireless services  whether those services are provided on a postpaid or a prepaid basis 
retail service revenue increased billion  or  in as compared to and increased million  or in as compared to the increase in retail service revenue in as compared to reflects an increase in postpaid service revenue related to our premium data add on charge required for all smartphones and greater popularity of unlimited and bundled plans  combined with other fee increases including an increase in our handset protection plan 
the increase was also driven by attracting more subscribers to our boost and virgin mobile prepaid brands who are choosing higher rate plans to take advantage of international offerings as well as the increased availability of smartphones and increased subscribers from new market launches for our assurance wireless brand 
the majority of the increase in as compared to was primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the company s national boost monthly unlimited prepaid plan in addition to service revenue related to the subscribers acquired through our fourth quarter acquisitions of virgin mobile and ipcs 
this increase in retail service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the company s average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately million  or  in as compared to wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through g mvno and affiliate relationships and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by sprint to other companies that resell those services to subscribers 
wholesale  affiliate and other revenues increased million  or  for as compared to  and decreased million  or  for as compared to the majority of the increase in as compared to was primarily a result of growth in our g mvno relationships 
specifically  growth in subscribers on the lifeline program offered through our mvno s reselling prepaid services  which is similar to our assurance wireless offering  contributed to revenue growth 
the majority of the decrease in as compared to was due to the transfer of million subscribers from wholesale and affiliates into postpaid and prepaid classifications as a result of the fourth quarter acquisitions of virgin mobile and ipcs 
the remaining decline in as compared to was primarily due to losses from two of our large mvnos throughout in addition to lower revenues received from services provided through our machine to machine initiative 
approximately of our wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent a growing number of connected devices 
these devices generate revenue from usage which varies depending on the solution being utilized 
average revenue per connected device is generally significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers  however  the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue

cost of services increased million  or  in compared to  primarily reflecting increased roaming due to higher g mvno data usage 
in addition  higher service and repair costs were incurred driven by the increase in the cost per unit of new and used devices due to the growth in smartphone popularity 
we are also in the process of renegotiating cell site leases to enable further flexibility in connection with network vision  including spectrum hosting services  which has resulted in a net increase to rent expense and is expected to continue until such time we can successfully deploy network vision and benefit from an overall reduction in our total portfolio of tower leases 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates and a decline in payments to third party vendors for use of their proprietary data applications and premium services as a result of contract renegotiations providing more favorable rates

this decline was partially offset by increased roaming due to higher data usage and an increase in license fees as a result of the continued growth in smartphone devices  which carry higher fees 
equipment net subsidy we recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user subscriber 
our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost  which is consistent with industry practice  as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices 
we reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the subscriber  and for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber primarily associated with obtaining a service plan 
additionally  the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier

point of sale discounts are included in the determination of equipment net subsidy when we purchase and resell devices 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the prior period is primarily due to the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions combined with incremental costs associated with our business combinations in the fourth quarter  offset by a decline in marketing expenditures related to our cost cutting initiatives

wireline service revenue and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage  but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage 
our wireline services provided to our wireless segment are generally accounted for based on market rates  which we believe approximate fair value 
the company generally re establishes these rates at the beginning of each fiscal year

in january  we received a million note receivable with a stated interest rate of from clearwire as a result of the additional investment provided to clearwire through our amended agreement in the fourth quarter that matures in two installments of million plus accrued interest in january and in january in september  we entered into a four year commitment with apple  inc to purchase a minimum number of smartphones  which on average  are expected to carry a higher subsidy per unit than other smartphones we sell 
our minimum commitment under this arrangement is approximately billion  however  we expect our actual purchases will exceed this amount 
this will result in an expected increase in cash outflow and reduction in 
table of contents operating income in the earlier years of the contract until such time as we may recover the acquisition costs through subscriber revenue 
additionally  in october  we announced our intention to accelerate the timeline associated with network vision  our network modernization plan 
in addition to network vision  we are currently experiencing rapid growth in data usage which requires additional capital for data capacity to meet our customers needs and to maintain customer satisfaction 
our accelerated timeline coupled with our capital needs to maintain and operate our existing infrastructure are expected to require approximately billion in total capital expenditures over the two year period ending december  in addition to our expectation of increased capital expenditures  we also expect network operating expenditures to increase during the deployment period 
to meet our short and long term liquidity requirements  we look to a variety of funding sources 
our existing liquidity balance and cash generated from operating activities is our primary source of funding 
in addition to cash flows from operating activities  we rely on the borrowing capacity available under our credit facility  the ability to issue debt and equity securities  and other forms of financing to support our short and long term liquidity requirements 
in november  sprint nextel corporation issued billion of senior notes due and billion of guaranteed notes due we believe these issuances  in addition to our existing available liquidity and cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements through at least including debt service requirements  and other significant future contractual obligations 
to maintain an adequate amount of available liquidity and execute according to the timeline of our current business plan  which includes network vision  subscriber growth and the expected achievement of a cost structure intended to achieve more competitive margins  we expect we will need to raise additional funds from external resources of approximately billion to billion through  dependent  in part  on our ability to maintain adequate cash balances and the ongoing availability of our existing unutilized borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities 
if we are unable to fund our remaining capital needs from external resources on terms acceptable to us  we would need to modify our existing business plan  which could adversely affect our expectation of long term benefits to results from operations and cash flows from operations 
in determining our expectation of future funding needs in the next months and beyond  we have considered projected revenues and expenses relating to our operations  anticipated levels and timing of capital expenditures  including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks  and fcc license acquisitions  anticipated payments under the report and order  as supplemented  any additional contributions we may make to our pension plan  scheduled debt service requirements  additional investments  if any  we may choose to make in clearwire  and other future contractual obligations and general corporate expenditures 
as of december   we had working capital of billion compared to billion as of december  the increase in working capital is primarily due to the net cash proceeds of approximately billion from the issuance of notes  increases in device and accessory inventory  and decreases in the current portion of long term debt related to the repayment of billion of sprint capital corporation senior notes due january the remaining change is primarily related to other activity in current assets during capital resources our ability to fund our capital needs from external sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets  as well as our performance and our credit ratings 
given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets  we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital 
as of december   moody s investor service  standard poor s ratings services  and fitch ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations 
table of contents rating rating agency issuer rating unsecured notes guaranteed notes credit facility outlook moody s b b ba ba review for downgrade standard and poor s b b bb negative fitch b b bb bb negative downgrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt 
however  downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings  if any  and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets 
the terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items  as defined by the credit facility adjusted ebitda  to be no more than to in october  our credit facility was amended to prospectively redefine adjusted ebitda to exclude costs comprising equipment net subsidy  as defined by the amended agreement  to the extent such costs exceed billion in any of the six consecutive fiscal quarters ending march  the amount added back related to this exclusion cannot exceed billion in any four consecutive fiscal quarters and is limited to billion in the aggregate for the six consecutive fiscal quarters ending march  after march   the ratio will be reduced to to  and further reduced to to after december  as of december  and  the ratio was to under this revolving bank credit facility  we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted ebitda exceeds to the terms of our amended revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to the london interbank offered rate libor  plus a margin of between to beginning in october certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility 
a default under our borrowings could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations  which in turn could result in the maturities being accelerated 
certain indentures that govern our outstanding notes also require compliance with various covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by the company and its subsidiaries  as defined by the terms of the indentures 
certain of our indentures also contain covenants that limit the company s ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets or to merge or consolidate with or into other companies 
we expect to remain in compliance with our covenants through at least the end of  although there can be no assurance that we will do so 
although we expect to improve our subscriber results  and execute on our network vision plans  including the decommissioning of the nextel platform  if we do not meet our plan  depending on the severity of any difference in actual results versus what we currently anticipate  it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations  which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness 
if such unforeseen events occur  we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings  although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions 
current business outlook we endeavor to both retain our existing and add new wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in postpaid wireless subscribers that we have experienced 
we expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience by enhancing our network  providing diversity of devices  and through offers which provide value  simplicity and productivity 
given the current economic environment  the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting  as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior  we are unable to forecast with assurance the net retail postpaid subscriber results we will experience during or thereafter 
however  the company expects consolidated segment earnings to be between billion and billion  including the estimated impact of the iphone and the effects of network vision 
we expect total net service revenue growth of approximately to 
the company also expects full year capital expenditures in  excluding capitalized interest  to be approximately billion 
the above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under forward looking statements and part i  item a risk factors in this report 

table of contents future contractual obligations the following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of december  future events  including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities  could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts 
see forward looking statements 
future contractual obligations total and thereafter in millions notes  bank credit facilities and debentures capital leases and financing obligation operating leases purchase orders and other commitments total includes principal and estimated interest payments 
interest payments are based on management s expectations for future interest rates 
represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites 
includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites  real estate  network equipment and office space 
includes service  spectrum  network capacity and other executory contracts 
excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of million 
see below for further discussion 
purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether we take delivery 
these amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future  but generally represent only our estimate of those items for which we are committed 
our estimates are based on assumptions about the variable components of the contracts such as hours contracted  number of subscribers  pricing  and other factors 
in addition  we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the delivery of functioning software or products 
because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements  no such amounts have been included in the table above 
the table above also excludes approximately million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified 
no time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding 
as a result  they are not firm commitments 
our liability for uncertain tax positions was million as of december  due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions  it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year s in the table 
the table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the report and order 
the report and order requires us to make a payment to the us treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the ghz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the mhz and mhz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs  or qualifying costs  that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities 
from the inception of the program through december   we have incurred approximately billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program 
this amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program 
we estimate  based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available  that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between and billion 
accordingly  we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the us treasury

critical accounting policies and estimates sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
sprint s more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in clearwire  valuation and recoverability of long lived assets  and evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management 
management regularly updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
these critical accounting policies have been discussed with sprint s board of directors 
sprint s significant accounting policies are summarized in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries 
investments where sprint maintains majority ownership  but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues  are accounted for using the equity method 
governance for sprint s major unconsolidated investment  clearwire  is based on clearwire board representation for which sprint does not have a majority vote 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors  including collection experience  aging of the accounts receivable portfolios  credit quality of the subscriber base  and other qualitative considerations 
to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends  the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate 
a change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of approximately million for the wireless segment and million for the wireline segment 
valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in clearwire we assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment 
this evaluation requires significant judgment regarding  but not limited to  the severity and duration of decline in market prices  the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery  financial condition  liquidity  and near term prospects of the investee  specific events  and other factors 
at each financial reporting measurement date  we evaluate the excess  if any  of sprint s carrying value over the estimated fair value of our investment in clearwire to determine if such excess  an implied unrealized loss  is other than temporary 
our evaluation considers  among other things  clearwire s market capitalization  volatility associated with clearwire s common stock  and the duration of a decline in clearwire s average trading stock price below sprint s carrying value 
our evaluation also considers tax benefits associated with our class b non voting common interests in clearwire communications llc  governance rights  our expectation of the duration of our ongoing relationship  as well as other factors 
based on our evaluation as of december   we recognized a non cash impairment of our investment in clearwire of million in the fourth quarter the carrying value of our equity method investment in clearwire as of december  totaled approximately billion 
valuation and recoverability of long lived assets long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets  as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects  may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 

table of contents property  plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives 
certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method 
depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property  plant and equipment 
these studies take into account actual usage  physical wear and tear  replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution 
when these factors indicate that an asset s useful life is different from the previous assessment  we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life 
depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method 
changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets  a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets 
impairment analyses  when performed  are based on our current business and technology strategy  views of growth rates for our business  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability 
our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 
if we continue to have operational challenges  including retaining and attracting subscribers  future cash flows of the company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group  and we could record asset impairments that are material to sprint s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in addition to the analysis described above  certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business  including network equipment  cell site development costs and software in development  are periodically assessed to determine recoverability 
network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet management s strategic network plans and will not be deployed 
software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed 
network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability 
in connection with network vision  including the decommissioning of the nextel platform  management may conclude in future periods that certain equipment will never be either deployed or redeployed  in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized 
refer to results of operations for additional information on asset impairments 
evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value 
our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value  including goodwill  of that reporting unit 
we regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment up to the carrying value of our goodwill  which was million as of december  the company recognizes that our market capitalization  the product of our traded stock price  and shares outstanding  is subject to volatility and  during certain periods  has been below our shareholders equity book value 
accordingly we monitor changes in our market capitalization between annual impairment tests to determine whether declines  if any  should necessitate an interim review of goodwill for impairment 
we consider a decline in our market capitalization that corresponds to an overall deterioration in stock market conditions to be less of an indicator of goodwill impairment than a unilateral decline in our market capitalization  which could result from adverse changes in our underlying operating performance  cash flows  financial condition and or liquidity 
in the event that our market capitalization does decline below its book value  we consider the length and severity of the decline and 
table of contents the reasons for the decline when assessing whether a potential goodwill impairment exists 
we believe that short term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect underlying aggregate fair value of our segments  which are our reporting units 
we also believe that the market price of our stock may not be representative of the fair value of our overall business since it does not include a control premium that a market participant may be willing to pay for the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that could be derived from control of the company 
however  if a decline in our market capitalization below book value persists for an extended period of time  we would likely consider the decline to be indicative of a decline in the estimated fair value at the reporting unit level 
differences in the company s actual future cash flows  operating results  growth rates  capital expenditures  cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for the purpose of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  as well as a decline in the company s stock price and related market capitalization  could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and  accordingly  potentially lead to a future goodwill impairment 
the determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  transactions within the wireless industry and related control premiums  discount rate  terminal growth rates  operating income before depreciation and amortization oibda and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the merits of each significant assumption  both individually and in the aggregate  used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit are evaluated for reasonableness 
a decline in the estimated fair value of our wireless reporting unit of would not result in an impairment of our goodwill 
fcc licenses and our sprint and boost mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets  in addition to goodwill  after considering the expected use of the assets  the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used  and the effects of obsolescence on their use 
when required  sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles  including fcc licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting 
in assessing recoverability of fcc licenses  we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the greenfield direct value method  which approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business 
assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include  but are not limited to  capital expenditures  subscriber activations and deactivations  market share achieved  tax rates in effect and discount rate 
a one percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value  a one percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a one percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our fcc licenses as of the most recent testing date 
a decline in the estimated fair value of fcc licenses of approximately also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb modified the accounting for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
these modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation based on a relative selling price method  including arrangements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
these modifications were effective beginning in the first quarter and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb amended the requirements for disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses 
as a result of these amendments  an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses 
the new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending december   while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period were effective for the first quarter  neither of which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurement 
table of contents under both us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs  including a consistent definition of the term fair value 
the amendments will be effective beginning in the first quarter  however  we do not expect the effects to be material 
the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income in june  which was subsequently revised in december  that amends existing guidance to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income  in either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive financial statements 
the guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
the amendments will be effective beginning in the first quarter  with early adoption permitted  require retrospective application  and will only effect presentation of information in our primary financial statements 
we early adopted the new presentation requirements which resulted in reporting the components of comprehensive income loss in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss  rather than in the consolidated statements of shareholders equity  as previously reported 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance regarding testing goodwill for impairment which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
the revised standard will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed beginning in the first quarter  with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances 
we early adopted the provisions of this standard as part of our annual assessment of goodwill with no effect on our financial statements 
forward looking statements we include certain estimates  projections and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in our annual  quarterly and current reports  and in other publicly available material

financial strategies general risk management policies our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions  and all transactions comply with the policy 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments  usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares 
derivative instruments are primarily used for hedging and risk management purposes 
hedging activities may be done for various purposes  including  but not limited to  mitigating the risks associated with an asset  liability  committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes  credit support agreements  continual review and monitoring of all counterparties  and thorough legal review of contracts 
exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates  foreign currencies  and equity prices 
the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors 
interest rate risk the communications industry is a capital intensive  technology driven business 
we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
specific interest rate risk includes the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings 
about of our debt as of december  was fixed rate debt 
while changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt  there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable 
we perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt 
these analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt 
a decline in market interest rates would cause a million increase in the fair market value of our debt to billion 
foreign currency risk we also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow 
we use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries 
the dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was less than million as of december  the potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant 
equity risk we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
we invest in equity instruments of public companies for operational and strategic business purposes 
these securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate 
these securities  which are classified in investments on the consolidated balance sheets  primarily include equity method investments  such as our investment in clearwire and available for sale securities 
in certain business transactions  we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates 
these warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments
