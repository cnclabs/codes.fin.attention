item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity contractual obligations for years beyond additional borrowings available despite our leverage  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur more indebtedness 
this could further exacerbate the risks described above  including our ability to service our indebtedness 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
although our senior secured credit facilities and the indenture governing the notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  such restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions  and under certain circumstances indebtedness incurred in compliance with such restrictions could be substantial 
the indenture will no longer impose any restrictions once the notes are redeemed 
for example  under our credit agreement  the term loans under the senior secured credit facilities may be increased by up to million in the aggregate  subject to certain exemptions and provided that group procures lender commitments for such increase 
as of december   the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facilities provided for additional borrowings of up to million  after giving effect to million of letters of credit issued on our behalf 
as of december   the titanium dioxide pigments venture facility provided for additional borrowings of up to million million after giving effect to an outstanding bank guarantee of million million related to a defined benefit pension obligation for our finland plan 
in january  this bank guarantee was increased to million million 
to the extent new debt is added to our debt levels  the substantial leverage risks described above would increase 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments our debt instruments contain a number of restrictive covenants which may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interest 
group s senior secured credit agreement and indenture governing the notes and the titanium dioxide pigment s venture facility agreement impose  and the terms of any future indebtedness may impose  operating and other restrictions on us 
such restrictions will affect  and in many respects limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to take certain actions 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources section for further details 
in addition  group s senior secured credit facilities require us and the titanium dioxide pigment s venture facility requires the venture to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control such as an economic downturn 
the restrictions and financial covenants contained in group s senior secured credit agreement and indenture governing the notes and the titanium dioxide pigment s venture facility could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations  acquisitions  investments or strategic plans or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest 
a breach of any of these covenants or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under the facilities described above 
if an event of default occurs under any of these facilities  which includes an event of default under the indenture governing the notes  the lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding  together with accrued and unpaid interest  to be immediately due and payable  require us to apply all of our available cash to repay the borrowings  or prevent us from making any principal  premium or interest payments  any of which would result in an event of default 
the lenders will also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further financing 
if we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings when due  our lenders could sell the collateral securing the senior secured credit facilities  which constitutes substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets 
economic uncertainty downturns in certain industries and general economic conditions could adversely affect our profitability and liquidity 
in the event another economic downturn or recession or disruption in the capital markets occurs  our results of operations  cash flows and financial position could be materially and adversely affected 
under such circumstances  the demand for our products could decrease  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  our products are used in certain industries  such as the automotive and construction industries 
prolonged downturns or bankruptcies in one or more of these industries could severely reduce demand for our products 
for example  sales in our performance additives business have been adversely impacted by downward trends in commercial and residential construction  housing starts and trends in residential repair and remodeling 
further  a downturn in the automotive industry  particularly in europe  may adversely affect the results of operations of our surface treatment business in our specialty chemicals and advanced ceramics segments 
moreover  if the value of one or more of our businesses deteriorates  we may be required to record additional impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations 
if we are unable to successfully anticipate or respond to changing economic conditions  our results of operations and financial position may be materially and adversely affected 
further  another economic downturn or recession or market disruption in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our pension plan assets  our statement of operations  our statement of changes in stockholders equity and our liquidity 
for example  we have several pension plans located in germany  finland  the united kingdom and the united states 
our funding obligations could change significantly based on the investment performance of the pension plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions for local statutory funding valuations 
any deterioration of the capital markets or returns available in such markets may negatively impact our pension plan assets and increase our funding obligations for one or more of these plans and negatively impact our liquidity 
we cannot predict the impact of this or any further market disruption on our pension funding obligations 
risks associated with acquisitions we may not be able to complete proposed acquisitions nor successfully integrate acquisitions we may undertake in the future 
the process of combining or acquiring businesses with rockwood involves risks 
we may face difficulty integrating the new operations  technologies  products and services of future acquisitions or combinations  and may incur unanticipated expenses related to future acquisitions 
the difficulties of combining operations may be magnified by integrating personnel with differing business backgrounds and corporate cultures 
failure to successfully manage and integrate acquisitions with our existing operations could lead to the potential loss of customers of the acquired business  the potential loss of employees who may be vital to the new operations  the potential loss of business opportunities or other adverse consequences that could affect our financial condition and results of operations 
even if integration occurs successfully  failure of any future acquisition or combination to achieve levels of anticipated sales growth  profitability or productivity comparable with those achieved by our existing operations  or otherwise not perform as expected  may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  certain acquisitions may trigger regulations designed to monitor competition and would therefore require regulatory approval 
we cannot predict whether such authorities will approve acquisitions we seek to accomplish in the future 
currency fluctuations because a significant portion of our operations is conducted in foreign currencies  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and may affect the comparability of our results between financial periods 
our operations are conducted by subsidiaries in many countries 
the results of their operations and financial condition are reported in their functional currency  generally their local currency  and are then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
the exchange rates between some of these currencies and the dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future 
a significant portion of our net sales and cost of products sold is denominated in euros 
approximately of our net sales were derived from subsidiaries whose local currency is the euro 
this increases the impact of the fluctuation of the euro against the us dollar 
furthermore  because a portion of our debt is denominated in euros  which as of december  equaled million million  we are further subject to fluctuation in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the euro 
for example  the us dollar euro rate increased from on december  to on december  being subject to this currency fluctuation may have an adverse effect on the carrying value of our debt 
a weakening or strengthening of the euro against the us dollar by would decrease or increase  respectively  by million the us dollar equivalent of our total euro denominated debt of million 
in addition  because our consolidated financial statements are reported in us dollars  the translation effect of such fluctuations has in the past significantly impacted  and may in the future  significantly impact the carrying value of our debt 
we also incur currency transaction risk whenever we enter into either a purchase or sale transaction using a currency other than the local currency of the transacting entity 
we may not be able to effectively manage our currency translation and or transaction risks  and as a result  volatility in currency exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of our debt and results of operations 
regulation of our raw materials  products and facilities our business could be adversely affected by regulation to which our raw materials  products and facilities are subject 
some of the raw materials we handle  and our products and facilities  are subject to government regulation 
these regulations affect the manufacturing processes  handling  uses and applications of our products 
in addition  some of our subsidiaries products contain raw materials  such as arsenic pentoxide  carbon disulfide  lithium carbonate  tetrahydrofuran  copper  chromic acid  silica  zinc chromate and lead that are deemed hazardous materials in certain situations 
the use and handling of these materials is regulated and some of these regulations require product registrations  which also are subject to renewal and potential revocation 
for example  in february  the epa announced a voluntary decision by cca manufacturers  including our subsidiaries  to amend their registrations for cca to limit use of cca treated lumber in most residential settings  effective december  these regulations may affect our ability to market certain chemicals we produce 
there is also a risk that other key raw materials or one or more of our products may be found to have  or be recharacterized as having  a toxicological or health related impact on the environment or on our customers or employees 
if such a discovery or recharacterization occurs  the relevant materials  chemicals or products  including products of our customers incorporating our materials or chemicals  may be recalled or banned or we may incur increased costs in order to comply with new regulatory requirements 
change in regulations  or their interpretation  may also affect the marketability of certain of our products 
we cannot predict how these and other findings from regulatory agencies may affect our cash flows or results of operations 
manufacturing hazards hazards associated with chemical manufacturing could adversely affect our results of operations 
due to the nature of our business  we are exposed to the hazards associated with chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials  products and wastes in our manufacturing facilities or our distribution centers  such as fires  explosions and accidents 
these hazards could lead to an interruption or suspension of operations and have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility or on our company as a whole 
other hazards include piping and storage tank leaks and ruptures  mechanical failure  employee exposure to hazardous substances  chemical spills and other discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  inclement weather and natural disasters 
these hazards may cause personal injury and loss of life  damage to property and contamination of the environment  which could lead to government fines or work stoppage injunctions and lawsuits by injured persons 
raw materials fluctuations in costs of our raw materials or our access to supplies of our raw materials could adversely affect our results of operations 
although no single raw material represented more than of our cost of products sold in  raw material costs generally account for a high percentage of our total costs of products sold 
in  raw materials constituted approximately of our cost of products sold 
we generally purchase raw materials based on supply agreements linked to market prices and therefore our results of operations are subject to short term fluctuations in raw materials prices 
these fluctuations limit our ability to accurately forecast future raw material costs and hence our profitability 
many of the raw materials we use are commodities  and the price of each can fluctuate widely for a variety of reasons  including changes in availability  major capacity additions or reductions or significant facility operating problems 
historically  there have been some price increases we have not been able to pass through to our customers 
this trend may continue in the future 
in addition  titanium bearing slag used in our titanium dioxide pigments segment is one of our largest raw materials in terms of dollars and is sourced primarily from two suppliers 
if one of our suppliers is unable to meet its obligations under our present supply agreement or we are unable to enter into new supply arrangements on competitive terms when our existing short term supply arrangements expire  we may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain these necessary raw materials 
in addition  a significant portion of our lithium compounds are processed at a single location of a supplier 
any disruption at this facility could adversely affect our ability to meet market demand for these products  our relationships with our customers and our results of operations 
furthermore  certain of our raw materials  such as cesium and lithium salts  are sourced from countries where political  economic and social conditions may be subject to instability 
in addition  one of our raw materials  lithium brine  requires a period of gestation before it can be used to produce lithium compounds 
in the event there is an increase in market demand for lithium products  or of unfavorable weather conditions at the lithium ponds  as we experienced in early  we may not be able to respond to such market demand on a timely basis 
any interruption of supply or any price increase of raw materials could result in our inability to meet demand for our products  loss of customer goodwill and higher costs of producing our products 
energy costs fluctuations in energy costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
energy purchases in constituted approximately of rockwood s cost of products sold 
fluctuations in the price of energy limit our ability to accurately forecast future energy costs and consequently our profitability 
for example  natural gas prices were volatile and increased in in europe 
rising energy costs may increase our raw material costs and negatively impact our customers and the demand for our products 
these risks will be heightened if our customers or production facilities are in locations experiencing severe energy shortages 
for example  our lithium facility in chile has experienced a shortage of natural gas in the past due to the argentine government s decision to ration its supply of natural gas to chile 
if energy prices fluctuate significantly  or we experience severe energy shortages  our business  in particular  our titanium dioxide segment where energy costs are more significant  or results of operations may be adversely affected 
environmental  health and safety regulations compliance with extensive environmental  health and safety laws could require material expenditures or changes in our operations 
our operations are subject to extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations at national  international and local levels in numerous jurisdictions 
in addition  our production facilities and a number of our distribution centers require operating permits that are subject to renewal 
the nature of the chemicals industry exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  transportation  disposal and sale of chemicals and materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
in  our capital expenditures for safety  health and environmental matters she were million  excluding costs to maintain and repair pollution control equipment 
for  we estimate capital expenditures for compliance with she laws to be at similar levels 
compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing  the cost of registration approval requirements  the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products  as well as the costs of the storage and disposal of wastes  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may incur substantial costs  including fines  damages  criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs  or experience interruptions in our operations  for violations arising under these laws or permit requirements 
furthermore  environmental laws are subject to change and have tended to become stricter over time 
such changes in environmental laws or their interpretation  or the enactment of new environmental laws  could result in materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs 
for example  proposed regulation related to greenhouse gases and carbon dioxide emissions  such as the cap and trade requirements  and potential revisions to the toxic control substances act  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations 
in addition  the discovery of contamination arising from historical industrial operations at some of our former and present properties has exposed us  and in the future may continue to expose us  to cleanup obligations and other damages 
for example  soil and groundwater contamination is known to exist at several of our facilities 
at december   we had approximately million in reserves for estimated environmental liabilities including reclamation obligations and estimated the potential range of exposure for such liabilities to be between million and million 
environmental indemnities we may be subject to environmental indemnity claims relating to properties we have divested 
the discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations under the sale agreements with the buyers of such properties or cleanup obligations and other damages under applicable environmental laws 
for example  we agreed to indemnify the buyers of our former electronics business and our plastic compounding business for certain environmental liabilities  respectively  related to such businesses 
we may not have adequate insurance coverage or cash flows to make such indemnity payments 
such payments may be costly and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
product liability due to the nature of our business and products  we may be liable for damages arising out of product liability claims 
the sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims 
for example  some of the chemicals or substances that are used in our businesses  such as arsenic pentoxide  have been alleged to represent potentially significant health and safety concerns 
our subsidiary in our timber treatment chemicals business line has been named as a defendant in personal injury suits in several jurisdictions with retailers and treaters named as other defendants 
these suits allege  among other things  product liability claims in connection with the use of timber products treated with cca  which utilizes arsenic pentoxide as a raw material 
for example  a subsidiary in our advanced ceramics segment has been named as a defendant in several product liability lawsuits in europe  which allege various claims against our subsidiary that manufactures ceramic components used in the production of artificial hip joints and our customer has been named in a lawsuit in the united states relating to a broken artificial hip joint 
also  because many of our products are integrated into our customers products  we may be requested to participate in or share in the costs of a product recall conducted by a customer 
for example  some of our businesses  including those within our specialty chemicals and advanced ceramics segments  supply products to customers in the automotive industry 
in the event one of these customers conducts a product recall that it believes is related to one of our products  we may be asked to participate in or fund in whole or in part such a recall 
our customers often require our subsidiaries to represent that our products conform to certain product specifications provided by our customers 
any failure to comply with such specifications could result in claims or legal action against our subsidiaries 
we are unable to estimate our exposure  if any  to the above mentioned lawsuits at this time 
we may be subject to future claims with regard to these suits or others like them and we may not be able to avoid significant product liability exposure 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims against us for which we are not otherwise indemnified or insured could materially increase our operating costs or prevent such operating subsidiary from satisfying its financial obligations 
for example  for policies renewed on or after november  our insurers excluded cca from our insurance coverage under our general liability policies 
we may not have sufficient cash flow from operations or assets to pay a judgment resulting from a product liability claim or product recall  if any  for which there is no or inadequate insurance coverage 
any such judgment or product recall could materially increase our operating costs or prevent such operating subsidiary from satisfying its financial obligations 
product liability due to the nature of our business and products  we may be liable for damages arising out of certain indemnity claims 
we may be subject to indemnity claims for product liability lawsuits relating to products we have sold 
for example  our timber treatment chemicals business has entered into indemnity agreements with various customers who purchased cca based wood protection products 
pursuant to those agreements  one of our subsidiaries agreed to defend and hold harmless those customers for certain causes of action  based on domestic mammalian  and in some cases  human toxicity  caused by our cca based wood protection products  subject to certain conditions 
our timber treatment chemicals business has received and may in the future receive claims for indemnity from customers in connection with litigation relating to cca based wood protection products and may be required to pay indemnity claims under such agreements to one or more of its customers 
customers of our advanced ceramics segment have requested indemnification in certain legal actions related to ceramic components we have supplied to them for use in their hip prosthesis systems 
if our subsidiaries are required to pay one or more indemnity claims  insurance may not cover such claims and  if not  our subsidiaries may not have sufficient free cash flow to pay such claims 
we are unable to estimate our exposure  if any  to these claims and lawsuits at this time 
in addition  our specialty chemicals segment s subsidiary that formerly manufactured sealants for insulating glass has been named as a defendant in several lawsuits relating to alleged negligent manufacturing of those products 
pursuant to the sale and purchase agreement with respect to the divested glass business  this subsidiary may be required to pay indemnity claims  mainly re glazing costs 
our insurance may not cover such claims and  in such a case  our subsidiary may not have sufficient cash flow to pay these claims 
one or more of these claims could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
fda regulation some of our manufacturing processes and facilities  pharmaceutical customers and medical device customers are subject to regulation by the fda or similar foreign agencies 
these requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 
regulatory requirements of the fda are complex 
any failure to comply with them could subject us and or our customers to fines  injunctions  civil penalties  lawsuits  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  denial of government approvals  withdrawal of marketing approvals and criminal prosecution 
any of these actions could adversely impact our net sales  undermine goodwill established with our customers  damage commercial prospects for our products and materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the manufacture and supply of ceramic ball head and liner components for hip joint prostheses systems by our advanced ceramics segment may be subject to the fda s quality system regulation  which imposes current good manufacturing practice requirements on the manufacture of medical devices 
certain lithium compounds manufactured by our fine chemicals business line of our specialty chemicals segment are also subject to fda regulation 
in addition  medical device customers of our advanced ceramics segment to whom we supply our ceramic ball head and liner components are subject to fda regulation  including premarket approval of their products and post market compliance requirements 
the fda may take three years or longer to grant premarket approval of our customers new products  if at all 
further  our competitors may seek pre market approval for products that compete with our ceramic hip components 
at any time  our customers total hip prostheses systems may be withdrawn from the market either voluntarily by our customers or as a result of the fda s or a foreign equivalent s withdrawal of marketing approval or removal of such products for a number of reasons including safety  current good manufacturing practice or quality system regulation problems with our products or our customers final products 
for example  a customer in our advanced ceramics segment initiated a voluntary recall in january of its hip implant system 
any such regulatory action could significantly limit our net sales generated by our advanced ceramics segment and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
competition our industry is highly competitive 
the end use markets in which we compete are also highly competitive 
this competition may adversely affect our results of operations 
we face significant competition from major international producers as well as smaller regional competitors 
our most significant competitors include major chemicals and materials manufacturers and diversified companies  a number of which have revenues and capital resources exceeding ours 
in addition  there is increasing competition from market participants in china 
within the end use markets in which we compete  competition between products is intense 
substitute products also exist for many of our products 
therefore  we face substantial risk that certain events  such as new product development by our competitors  changing customer needs  production advances for competing products  price changes in raw materials and products  our failure to secure patents or the expiration of patents  could result in declining demand for our products as our customers switch to substitute products or undertake manufacturing of such products on their own 
if we are unable to develop  produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors  our results of operations may materially suffer 
we believe that our customers are increasingly looking for strong  long term relationships with a few key suppliers that help them improve product performance  reduce costs  or support new product development 
to satisfy these growing customer requirements  our competitors have been consolidating within product lines through mergers and acquisitions 
we may also need to invest and spend more on research and development and marketing costs to strengthen existing customer relationships  as well as attract new customers 
as a result  our debt level could limit our flexibility to react to these industry trends and our ability to remain competitive 
product innovation if we are not able to continue our technological innovation and successful commercial introduction of new products  our profitability could be adversely affected 
our industries and the end use markets into which we sell our products experience periodic technological change and product improvement 
manufacturers periodically introduce new generations of products or require new technological capacity to develop customized products 
our future growth will depend on our ability to gauge the direction of the commercial and technological progress in all key end use markets and upon our ability to fund and successfully develop  manufacture and market products in such changing end use markets 
we will have to continue to identify  develop  market and in certain cases  secure regulatory approval for innovative products on a timely basis to replace or enhance existing products in order to maintain our profit margins and our competitive position 
we may not be successful in developing new products and or technology  either alone or with third parties  or licensing intellectual property rights from third parties on a commercially competitive basis 
our new products may not be accepted by our customers or may fail to receive regulatory approval 
if we fail to keep pace with the evolving technological innovations in our end use markets on a competitive basis  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
dependence on intellectual property if our intellectual property were copied by competitors  or if they were to develop similar intellectual property independently  our results of operations could be negatively affected 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to protect and preserve our intellectual property rights  which rights we own or use pursuant to licenses granted to us by third parties 
the confidentiality and patent assignment agreements we enter into with most of our key employees and third parties to protect the confidentiality  ownership and use of intellectual property may be breached  may not be enforceable  or may provide for joint ownership or ownership by a third party 
in addition  we may not have adequate remedies for a breach by the other party  which could adversely affect our intellectual property rights 
the use of our intellectual property rights or intellectual property similar to ours by others or our failure to protect such rights could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed  adversely affecting our net sales 
if we must sue to protect  defend or enforce our intellectual property rights  any suits or proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of company resources and management attention  and we may not prevail in such action 
we are periodically involved in actions related to misappropriation of our intellectual property by former employees 
in addition  when our patents expire  competitors or new market entrants may manufacture products substantially similar to our products previously protected by a patent 
we conduct research and development activities with third parties and license certain intellectual property rights from third parties and we plan to continue to do so in the future 
for example  in our timber treatment chemicals business  we commercialized ecolife  our next generation timber treatment preservative from our timber treatment chemicals business  through our joint venture with rohm and haas company a subsidiary of the dow chemical company 
we endeavor to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on terms favorable to us 
however  we may not be able to license or otherwise obtain intellectual property rights on such terms or at all 
our inability to license or otherwise obtain such intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our ability to create a competitive advantage and create innovative solutions for our customers  which will adversely affect our net sales and our relationships with our customers 
the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage and may be challenged by third parties 
we have been subject to oppositions of our patents and trademarks by third parties before regulatory bodies in certain jurisdictions 
our failure to defend these patents or registered trademarks may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications were intended to cover 
in addition  a failure to obtain and defend our trademark registrations may impede our marketing and branding efforts and competitive position 
a failure to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and our net sales 
risk of intellectual property litigation our products or processes may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to pay unexpected litigation costs or damages or prevent us from selling our products 
although it is our intention to avoid infringing or otherwise violating the intellectual property rights of others  our processes and products may infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement by us or our licensees of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming  regardless of the merits of any claim  and could divert our management s attention from operating our businesses 
if we were to discover or be notified that our processes or products potentially infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others  we may need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re engineer our products and processes in order to avoid infringement 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms  or at all  or be able to re engineer our products successfully 
moreover  if we are sued for infringement and lose the suit  we could be required to pay substantial damages and or be enjoined from using or selling the infringing products or technology 
any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling our products 
international operations as a global business  we are exposed to local business risks in different countries which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and the value of our common stock 
we have significant operations in many countries  including manufacturing facilities  research and development facilities  sales personnel and customer support operations 
currently  we operate  or others operate on our behalf  facilities in countries such as brazil  chile  china  czech republic  india  malaysia  mexico  poland  singapore  south africa  south korea  taiwan and turkey 
of our total net sales in of  million  approximately were generated by shipments to customers in countries outside north america 
our operations are affected directly and indirectly by global regulatory  economic and political conditions  including new and different legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions  managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations  increased costs of  and availability of  transportation or shipping  credit risk and financial conditions of local customers and distributors  potential difficulties in protecting intellectual property  risk of nationalization of private enterprises by foreign governments  potential imposition of restrictions on investments  potentially adverse tax consequences  including imposition or increase in withholding and other taxes on remittances  repatriation or other payments by subsidiaries  capital controls  and local political  economic and social conditions  including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions and political instability in certain countries 
in addition  our facilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could result in full or partial disruption of the activities of such facilities 
we may not succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies to counter the foregoing factors effectively in each location where we do business 
our failure to do so could limit our ability to sell products  compete or receive payments for products sold in such locations 
furthermore  our subsidiaries are subject to rules and regulations related to anti bribery prohibitions and export controls and economic embargoes  violations of which may carry substantial penalties 
for example  export control and economic embargo regulations limit the ability of our subsidiaries to market  sell  distribute or otherwise transfer their products or technology to prohibited countries or persons 
failure to comply with these regulations could subject our subsidiaries to fines  enforcement actions and or have an adverse effect on our reputation and the value of our common stock 
in addition  we are subject to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act and the health care and education reconciliation act of and the cost of compliance may adversely impact our results of operations 
retention of key personnel if we lose certain key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy 
our success depends  in part  upon the continued services of our highly skilled personnel involved in management  research  production  sales and distribution  and  in particular  upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and key employees 
although we believe that we are adequately staffed in key positions and that we will be successful in retaining key personnel  we may not be able to retain such personnel on acceptable terms or at all 
furthermore  if we lose the service of any executive officers or key employees  we may not be able to execute our business strategy 
we do not have key person life insurance covering any of our employees 
relations with employees we are subject to stringent labor and employment laws in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  and our relationship with our employees could deteriorate  which could adversely impact our operations 
a majority of our full time employees are employed outside the united states  particularly in germany where many of our businesses are located 
in certain jurisdictions where we operate  particularly in germany  labor and employment laws are relatively stringent and  in many cases  grant significant job protection to certain employees  including rights on termination of employment 
in addition  in certain countries where we operate  including germany  our employees are members of unions or are represented by a works council as required by law 
we are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these unions and or respective works councils 
these regulations and laws coupled with the requirement to consult with the relevant unions or works councils could significantly limit our flexibility in managing costs and responding to market changes 
furthermore  with respect to our employees that are subject to collective bargaining arrangements or similar arrangements approximately one third of our full time employees as of february   we may not be able to negotiate labor agreements on satisfactory terms and actions by our employees may disrupt our business 
if these workers were to engage in a strike  work stoppage  sabotage or other slowdown  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs 
in addition  if our other employees were to become unionized  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations and or higher ongoing labor costs 
tax liabilities if gea group aktiengesellschaft formerly known as mg technologies ag or degussa uk holdings  ltd 
fail to satisfy their contractual obligations  we may be subject to increased tax exposure resulting from pre acquisition periods 
under the terms of certain purchase agreements  third party sellers have agreed to substantially indemnify us for tax liabilities pertaining to the pre acquisition periods 
to the extent such companies fail to indemnify or satisfy their obligations  or if any amount is not covered by the terms of the indemnity  earnings could be negatively impacted in future periods through increased tax expense 
net loss we have experienced losses in the past and may experience losses in the future and cannot be certain that our net operating loss carryforwards will continue to be available to offset our tax liability 
we have incurred net losses in the past and we may incur net losses in the future 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million related to worldwide net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
additionally  at december   we had a total valuation allowance of million related to net operating loss deferred tax assets and deferred tax assets related to cumulative temporary differences 
if our operating performance deteriorates in the future in certain tax jurisdictions  we may be unable to realize these net operating loss carryforwards and we may be required to record an additional valuation allowance 
anticipated capital expenditures our required capital expenditures may exceed our estimates 
our capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  which consisted of expenditures to maintain and improve existing equipment and substantial investments in new equipment 
capital expenditures for are expected to be above levels 
future capital expenditures may be significantly higher  depending on the investment requirements of each of our business lines  and may also vary substantially if we are required to undertake actions to compete with new technologies in our industry 
we may not have the capital necessary to undertake these capital investments 
if we are unable to do so  we may not be able to effectively compete in some of our markets 
information security the security of our information technology systems could be compromised  which could adversely affect our ability to operate 
we depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers  as well as maintain financial accuracy and efficiency 
our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and outsourced service providers 
if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure  we could be subject to transaction errors  processing inefficiencies  the loss of customers  business disruptions  or the loss of or damage to our intellectual property through security breach 
as with all large systems  our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information  corrupting information  or disrupting business processes 
our systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to hacking attempts
