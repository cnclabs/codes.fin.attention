item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto  included in part ii item of this report 
average balances  including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios  are generally comprised of average daily balances 
the disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in part i captioned forward looking statements and item a captioned risk factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report 
executive overview significant items for the year ended december  were as follows capital redeemed all of the outstanding preferred stock issued to the us treasury under tarp cpp for an aggregate purchase price of million 
also  repurchased the common stock warrant issued to the us treasury for thousand 
this represents full repayment of all tarp obligations 
issued and sold to the treasury  shares of its senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  having a liquidation preference of  per share  for aggregate proceeds net of issuance costs of million 
the issuance was pursuant to the us treasury s small business lending fund program 
increased our total risk based capital ratio to as of december   compared to as of december   due to the issuance of series b preferred stock  and moderate earnings 
declared cash dividends of per share for each quarter in in determining the amount of dividends to be paid  we consider capital preservation  expected asset growth  projected earnings and our overall dividend pay out ratio 
paid preferred stock dividends of thousand in compared to thousand in financial performance net earnings per diluted common share were in  as compared to per diluted common share earned in the increase in net earnings per diluted common share is principally attributed to reduced provision for loan and lease losses in  partially offset by increased basic and dilutive weighted average shares 
net interest margin  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased to in from in the modest decrease in net interest margin resulted from decreased yields on the loan portfolio and the available for sale investment portfolio  partially offset by lower funding costs pertaining to re pricing of interest bearing deposits and other borrowings 
average earning assets increased to million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in average earning assets was primarily driven by increases in mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds held in the available for sale investment portfolio 
we recorded gains of million on the sale investment securities in  compared to gains of million during mortgage banking revenue was million in  compared to million in closed mortgage volume was million during 
table of contents total deposits were million as of december   an increase of million  or  as compared to december  the company s annualized organic deposit growth rate was during total consolidated assets were million as of december   compared to million as of december  increases in the available for sale investment portfolio and loans held for sale were offset by decreases in interest bearing due from banks and net portfolio loans 
credit quality nonperforming assets increased to million  or of total assets  as of december   compared to million  or of total assets as of december  nonperforming loans increased million to million  or of total loans  as of december   compared to million  or of total loans as of december  nonaccrual loans have been written down to their estimated net realizable values 
net charge offs were million in  or of average loans  as compared to net charge offs of million or of average loans in the overall trends in credit quality indicators have improved in the current year  which has contributed to a decreased alll at december  provision for loan and lease losses in was million as compared to million as of december   representing a million decrease 
during  provision expense to net charge offs was compared to in as a result of improvements in credit quality indicators

management will attempt to minimize risk to our shareholders by making prudent business decisions  maintaining adequate levels of capital and reserves  and communicating effectively with shareholders 
our vision is to embrace changes in the industry and develop profitable business strategies that allow us to both maintain customer relationships and build new ones 
our competitors are no longer just banks 
we must compete with financial powerhouses that want our core business 
we have developed strategic plans that evaluate additional services and products that can be delivered to our customers efficiently and profitably 
producing quality returns is  as always  a top priority 
it is also our vision of the company to remain independent  expanding our presence through internal growth and the addition of strategically important full service and focused service locations 
we will pursue attractive opportunities to enter related lines of business and to acquire financial institutions with complementary lines of business 
we will strive to continue our expansion into profitable markets in order to build franchise value 
we will distinguish ourselves from the competition by a commitment to efficient delivery of products and services in our target markets to businesses and professionals  while maintaining personal relationships with mutual loyalty 
our long term success rests on the shoulders of the leadership team and its ability to effectively enhance the performance of the company 
as a financial services company  we are in the business of taking and managing risks 
whether we are successful depends largely upon whether we take the right risks and get paid appropriately for those risks 
our governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of the company s business effectively through an integrated process that includes financial  strategic  risk and leadership planning 
we define risks to include not only credit  market and liquidity risk  the traditional concerns for financial institutions  but also operational risks  including risks related to systems  processes or external events  as well as 
table of contents legal  regulatory and reputation risks 
our management processes  structures  and policies help to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision making and accountability 
results are important  but equally important is how we achieve those results 
our core values and commitment to high ethical standards is material to sustaining public trust and confidence in our company 
risk management overview through our corporate governance structure  risk and return is evaluated to produce sustainable revenues  reduce risks of earnings volatility and increase shareholder value 
the financial services industry is exposed to four major risks  liquidity  credit  market and operational 
liquidity risk is the inability to meet liability maturities and withdrawals  fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates 
credit risk is the inability of a customer to meet its repayment obligations 
market risk is the fluctuation in asset and liability values caused by changes in market prices and yields  and operational risk is the potential for losses resulting from events involving people  processes  technology  legal issues  external events  regulation  or reputation 
board committees our corporate governance structure begins with our board of directors 
the board of directors evaluates risk through the chief executive officer ceo and four board committees loan committee reviews credit risks and the adequacy of the alll 
alco reviews liquidity and market risks 
audit and qualified legal compliance committee reviews the scope and coverage of internal and external audit activities  and nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates corporate governance structure  charters  committee performance and acts in best interests of the corporation and its shareholders with regard to the appointment of director nominees 
these committees review reports from management  the company s auditors  and other outside sources 
on the basis of materials that are available to them and on which they rely  the committees review the performance of the company s management and personnel  and establish policies  but neither the committees nor their individual members in their capacities as members of the board of directors are responsible for daily operations of the company 
in particular  risk management activities relating to individual loans are undertaken by company personnel in accordance with the policies established by the committees of the board of directors 
senior leadership committees to ensure that our risk management goals and objectives are accomplished  oversight of our risk taking and risk management activities are conducted through five senior leadership committees comprised of members of management the senior leadership committee establishes short and long term strategies and operating plans 
the committee establishes performance measures and reviews performance to plan on a monthly basis the technology steering committee establishes technological strategies  makes technology investment decisions  and manages the implementation process the alco round table committee establishes and monitors liquidity ranges  pricing  maturities  investment goals  and interest spread on balance sheet accounts and the sox compliance committee has established the master plan for full documentation of the company s internal controls and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of 
table of contents risk management controls we use various controls to manage risk exposure within the company 
budgeting and planning processes provide for early indication of unplanned results or risk levels 
models are used to estimate market risk and net interest income sensitivity 
segmentation analysis is used to estimate expected and unexpected credit losses 
compliance with regulatory guidelines plays a significant role in risk management as well as corporate culture and the actions of management 
our code of ethics provides the guidelines for all employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of service to our clients 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk liquidity risk is the inability to meet liability maturities and withdrawals  fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates 
liquidity management involves maintaining ample and diverse funding capacity  liquid assets and other sources of cash to accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to business shocks or unanticipated events 
alco is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy and the accounting department is responsible for planning and executing the funding activities and strategies 
sources of liquid assets consist of the repayments and maturities of loans  selling of loans  short term money market investments  and cash flows from maturities and sales of available for sale securities 
increased liquidity from net loan repayments and increased deposits  were completely offset by pay downs of fhlb advances 
increases in available for sale security balances were responsible for the major use of liquidity 
the weighted average life of the available for sale security portfolio is years 
liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and fhlb borrowings 
we emphasize preserving and maximizing customer deposits and other customer based funding sources 
deposit marketing strategies are reviewed for consistency with liquidity policy objectives 
we have available correspondent banking lines of credit through correspondent relationships totaling approximately million and available secured borrowing lines of approximately million with the fhlb 
in addition  we have a secured borrowing line with the federal reserve bank frb  and had million in available credit at the frb 
while these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of liquidity in the future  their mix  as well as the possible use of other sources  will depend on future economic and market conditions 
liquidity is also provided through cash flows generated through our operations 
our liquid assets cash and amounts due from banks  interest bearing deposits held at other banks  and available for sale securities totaled million or of total assets at december   million or of total assets at december   and million or of total assets at december  the holding company could potentially receive dividends from the bank in see note of the consolidated financial statements in this document for a discussion of the restrictions on the bank s ability to pay dividends 
to accommodate future growth and business needs  we develop an annual capital expenditure budget during strategic planning sessions 
we expect that our earnings  acquisition of core deposits and wholesale borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to support liquidity needs in other borrowings we actively use fhlb advances as a source of wholesale funding to provide liquidity and to implement leverage strategies 
at december   the company had one overnight advance  four advances maturing in less than year  and two longer term advances maturing within three to five years 
five of the advances were fixed rate  
table of contents and one floated to three month libor plus one basis point 
the advances did not contain call or put features 
as of december   the company had million in fhlb advances outstanding compared to million at december  and million at december  dollars in thousands securities sold under agreements to repurchase with weighted average interest rates of  and at december   and  respectively federal home loan bank borrowings with weighted average interest rates of  and at december   and  respectively total other borrowings dollars in thousands securities sold under agreements to repurchase maximum outstanding at any month end average balance during the year weighted average interest rate during year federal home loan bank borrowings maximum outstanding at any month end average balance during the year weighted average interest rate during year credit risk management credit risk arises from the inability of a customer to meet its repayment obligations 
credit risk exists in our outstanding loans  letters of credit and unfunded loan commitments 
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower  repayment sources and the nature of underlying collateral given current events and conditions 
commercial portfolio credit risk management commercial credit risk management begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the individual borrower based on an analysis of the borrower s financial position in light of current industry  economic or geopolitical trends 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower  each commercial credit is assigned a risk grade and is subject to approval based on existing credit approval standards 
risk grading is a substantial factor in determining the adequacy of the alll 
credit decisions are determined by credit administration to certain limitations and approvals from the loan committee above certain limitations 
credit risk is continuously monitored by credit administration for possible adjustment if there has been a change in the borrower s ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we manage the size of our credit exposure through loan sales and loan participation agreements 
the primary sources of repayment of our commercial loans are from the borrowers operating cash flows and the borrowers conversion of short term assets to cash 
the net assets of the borrower or guarantor are usually identified as a secondary source of repayment 
the principal factors affecting our risk of loss from commercial lending include each borrower s ability to manage its business affairs and cash flows  local and general economic conditions and real estate values in our service area 
we manage our commercial loan portfolio by monitoring our borrowers payment performance and their respective financial condition and make periodic adjustments  if necessary  to the risk grade assigned to each loan in the portfolio 
our evaluations of our borrowers are facilitated by management s knowledge of local market conditions and periodic reviews by a consultant of our credit administration policies 

table of contents real estate portfolio credit risk management the principal source of repayment of our real estate construction loans is the sale of the underlying collateral or the availability of permanent financing from the company or other lending source 
the principal risks associated with real estate construction lending include project cost overruns that absorb the borrower s equity in the project and deterioration of real estate values as a result of various factors  including competitive pressures and economic downturns 
we manage our credit risk associated with real estate construction lending by establishing a loan to value ratio on projects on an as completed basis  inspecting project status in advance of disbursements  and matching maturities with expected completion dates 
generally  we require a loan to value ratio of not more than on single family residential construction loans 
our specific underwriting standards and methods for each principal line of lending include industry accepted analysis and modeling and certain proprietary techniques 
our underwriting criteria are designed to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines  including required loan to value ratios 
our credit administration policies contain mandatory lien position and debt service coverage requirements  and the bank generally requires a guarantee from individuals owning or more of the borrowing entity 
concentrations of credit risk the company grants real estate mortgage loans to customers throughout california  oregon  washington  and colorado 
in addition  the company grants real estate construction  commercial  and installment loans and leases to customers throughout northern california 
in management s judgment  a concentration exists in real estate related loans  which represented approximately of the company s loan and lease portfolio at december   and at december  commercial real estate concentrations are managed to assure wide geographic and business diversity 
although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability  a substantial decline in the economy in general  material increases in interest rates  changes in tax policies  tightening credit or refinancing markets  or a decline in real estate values in the company s primary market areas in particular  such as was seen with the deterioration in the residential development market since  could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans 
personal and business incomes  proceeds from the sale of real property  or proceeds from refinancing  represent the primary sources of repayment for a majority of these loans 
the bank recognizes the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions 
accordingly  to prevent excessive exposure to any single correspondent  the bank has established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to any single correspondent 
in addition  the bank has an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccruing loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing interest  and other real estate owned 
our practice is to place an asset on nonaccrual status when one of the following events occurs any installment of principal or interest is days or more past due unless in management s opinion the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  management determines the ultimate collection of principal or interest to be unlikely  or the terms of the loan have been renegotiated due to a serious weakening of the borrower s financial condition 
nonperforming loans include impaired loans which may be on nonaccrual  are days past due and still accruing  or have been restructured and are not in compliance with their modified terms 
oreo represents real estate which the bank has taken control of in partial or full satisfaction of loans 
at the time of foreclosure  oreo is recorded at the lower of the carrying amount of the loan or fair value less costs to sell  which becomes the property s new basis 
any write downs based on the asset s fair value at the date of 
table of contents acquisition are charged to the alll 
after foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations such that the real estate is carried at the lower of its new cost basis or fair value  net of estimated costs to sell 
subsequent valuation adjustments are recognized within net loss oreo 
revenue and expenses from operations and subsequent adjustments to the carrying amount of the property are included in other non interest income and non interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
allowance for loan and lease losses the alll represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the loans and leases portfolio 
within the allowance  reserves are allocated to segments of the portfolio based on specific formula components 
changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for loan and lease losses 
we perform periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of our lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectability 
we evaluate general conditions such as the portfolio composition  size and maturities of various segmented portions of the portfolio such as secured  unsecured  construction  and small business administration sba 
we also evaluate concentrations of borrowers  industries  geographical sectors  loan product  loan classes and collateral types  volume and trends of loan delinquencies and nonaccrual  criticized and classified assets and trends in the aggregate in significant credits identified as watch list items 
our alll is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based upon independent methodologies 
all components of the alll represent an estimation based on certain observable data that management believes most reflects the underlying credit losses being estimated 
changes in the amount of each component of the alll are directionally consistent with changes in the observable data  taking into account the interaction of the components over time 
an essential element of the methodology for determining the alll is our credit risk evaluation process  which includes credit risk grading of individual  commercial  construction  commercial real estate  and consumer loans 
loans are assigned credit risk grades based on our assessment of conditions that affect the borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement 
that process includes reviewing borrower s current financial information  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and other information specific to each individual borrower 
loans are reviewed on an annual or rotational basis or as management become aware of information affecting the borrower s ability to fulfill its obligations 
credit risk grades carry a dollar weighted risk percentage 
for individually impaired loans  we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price or the fair value of collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
when developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan  we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions  including the effect of existing environmental factors 
in addition to the alll  an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined using estimates of the probability of funding and the associated inherent credit risk 
this reserve is carried as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets 
we make provisions to the alll on a regular basis through charges to operations that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations as provision expense for loan losses 
when a loan is deemed uncollectible  it is charged against the allowance 
any recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited back to the allowance 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular categories of the loan portfolio 
various regulatory agencies periodically review our alll as an integral part of their examination process 
such agencies may require us to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available 
table of contents to them at the time of their examination 
there is uncertainty concerning future economic trends 
accordingly  it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provisions for possible loan losses in future periods 
the alll should not be interpreted as an indication that charge offs in future periods will occur in the stated amounts or proportions 
market risk management general market risk is the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
market risk is inherent in our operating positions and activities including customers loans  deposit accounts  securities and long term debt 
loans and deposits generate income and expense  respectively  and the value of cash flows changes based on general economic levels  and most importantly  the level of interest rates 
the goal for managing our assets and liabilities is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the company to undue interest rate risk 
the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
we do not operate a trading account  and do not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange 
we face market risk through interest rate volatility 
net interest income or margin risk is measured based on rate shocks over different time horizons versus a current stable interest rate environment 
assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used in the planning and budgeting model 
the overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis with alco 
securities portfolio the securities portfolio is central to our asset liability management strategies 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity and regulatory requirements 
we classify our securities as available for sale or held to maturity at the time of purchase 
we do not engage in trading activities 
securities held to maturity is carried at cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 
securities available for sale may be sold to implement our asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors 
securities available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses  net of income taxes  are reported as a component of accumulated oci  in a separate component of shareholders equity 
gain or loss on sale of securities is based on the specific identification method 
operational risk management operational risk is the potential for loss resulting from events involving people  processes  technology  legal or regulatory issues  external events  and reputation 
in keeping with the corporate governance structure  the senior leadership committee is responsible for operational risk controls 
operational risks are managed through specific policies and procedures  controls and monitoring tools 
examples of these include reconciliation processes  transaction monitoring and analysis and system audits 
operational risks fall into two major categories  business specific and company wide 
the senior leadership committee works to ensure consistency in policies  processes and assessments 
with respect to company wide risks  the senior leadership committee works directly with members of our board of directors to develop policies and procedures for information security  business resumption plans  compliance and legal issues 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents management has determined the following five accounting policies to be critical valuation of investments and impairment of securities  allowance for loan and lease losses  accounting for income taxes  accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities  and accounting for fair value measurements 
valuation of investments and impairment of securities at the time of purchase  the company designates the security as held to maturity or available for sale  based on its investment objectives  operational needs and intent to hold 
the company does not engage in trading activity 
securities designated as held to maturity are carried at cost adjusted for the accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity 
securities designated as available for sale may be sold to implement the company s asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors 
securities designated as available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses  net of income taxes  are reported as part of accumulated oci loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
gains or losses on sale of securities are based on the specific identification method 
the market value and underlying rating of the security is monitored for quality 
securities may be adjusted to reflect changes in valuation as a result of other than temporary declines in value 
investments with fair values that are less than amortized cost are considered impaired 
impairment may result from either a decline in the financial condition of the issuing entity or  in the case of fixed rate investments  from changes in interest rates 
at each financial statement date  management assesses each investment to determine if impaired investments are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other than temporary based upon the positive and negative evidence available 
evidence evaluated includes  but is not limited to  industry analyst reports  credit market conditions  and interest rate trends 
when an investment is other than temporarily impaired  the company assesses whether it intends to sell the security  or it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current period credit losses 
if the company intends to sell the security or if it more likely than not that the company will be required to sell security before recovery of the amortized cost basis  the entire amount of otti is recognized in earnings 
for debt securities that are considered other than temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis  we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related credit loss component and the amount due to all other factors 
the credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is calculated as the difference between the investment s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows 
the remaining differences between the investment s fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is deemed to be due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in oci 
significant judgment is required in the determination of whether otti has occurred for an investment 
the company follows a consistent and systematic process for determining and otti loss 
the company has designated the alco committee responsible for the other than temporary evaluation process 
the alco committee s assessment of whether otti loss should be recognized incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information including  but not limited to the length of time and the extent of which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments  and general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook 
allowance for loan and lease losses alll is based upon estimates of loan losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge offs 
in periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance  
table of contents management considers our past loan loss experience by type of credit  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors 
we formally assess the adequacy of the alll on a monthly basis 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of classified loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are reviewed as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower and or when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of default 
confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by outside consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by periodic examination by various bank regulatory agencies 
management monitors delinquent loans continuously and identifies problem loans to be evaluated individually for impairment testing 
for loans that are determined impaired  formal impairment measurement is performed at least quarterly on a loan by loan basis 
our method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans  an allowance factor for categories of credits and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  portfolio trends  concentration of credit  growth  economic factors 
allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
loss estimation factors for loan categories are based on analysis of local economic factors applicable to each loan category 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the loan portfolio as a whole 
income taxes income taxes reported in the financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach 
we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in projecting future taxable income  management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pretax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business 
the company files consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
we recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examination 
for tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold  we may recognize only the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
management believes that all of our tax positions taken meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
to the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions  our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities 
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business the company is subject to risk from adverse fluctuations in interest rates 
the company manages these risks through a program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments  
table of contents primarily swaps and forwards 
counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
the company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company s objective in managing exposure to market risk is to limit the impact on earnings and cash flow 
the extent to which the company uses such instruments is dependent on its access to these contracts in the financial markets and its success using other methods  such as netting exposures in the same currencies to mitigate foreign exchange risk and using sales agreements that permit the pass through of commodity price and foreign exchange rate risk to customers 
all of the company s outstanding derivative financial instruments are recognized in the balance sheet at their fair values 
the effect on earnings from recognizing the fair values of these derivative financial instruments depends on their intended use  their hedge designation  and their effectiveness in offsetting changes in the fair values of the exposures they are hedging 
changes in the fair values of instruments designated to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in the fair values of recognized assets and liabilities and unrecognized firm commitments are reported in earnings along with changes in the fair values of the hedged items 
changes in the effective portions of the fair values of instruments used to reduce or eliminate adverse fluctuations in cash flows of anticipated or forecasted transactions are reported in equity as a component of accumulated oci 
amounts in accumulated oci are reclassified to earnings when the related hedged items affect earnings or the anticipated transactions are no longer probable 
changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are reported currently in earnings 
amounts reported in earnings are classified consistent with the item being hedged 
for derivative financial instruments accounted for as hedging instruments  the company formally designates and documents  at inception  the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure  the risk management objective  and the manner in which effectiveness of the hedge will be assessed 
the company formally assesses both at inception and at each reporting period thereafter  whether the derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
any ineffective portion of the change in fair value of the instruments is recognized immediately into earnings 
the company discontinues the use of hedge accounting prospectively when the derivative instrument is no longer effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged item  the derivative instrument expires  is sold  terminated  or exercised  or designating the derivative instrument as a hedge is no longer appropriate 
derivative loan commitments the company  through its majority owned subsidiary  bank of commerce mortgage  enters into forward delivery contracts to sell residential mortgage loans or mortgage backed securities to broker dealers at specific prices and dates mbs tbas in order to hedge the interest rate risk in its portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale and its mandatory residential mortgage loan commitments 
these derivative instruments consist primarily of irlc s executed with borrowers and mandatory forward purchase commitments with investor lenders 
these derivative instruments have not been designated for hedge accounting treatment  accordingly changes in the fair values are reflected in earnings as a component of mortgage banking revenue  net 
at december   the company maintained open forward sales positions of million  and mandatory loan commitment rate locks of million 
interest rate swap agreements as part of the company s risk management strategy  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements or other derivatives to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in certain assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are accounted for as cash flow hedges  with the changes in fair value reflected in oci and subsequently reclassified to earnings when gains or losses are realized on the hedged item 
at december   the company maintained a notional amount of million in rate swap agreements 

table of contents fair value measurements we use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities  and to determine fair value disclosures 
we base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
securities available for sale  derivatives  and loans held for sale  if any  are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis  such as certain impaired loans held for investment  oreo  and goodwill 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting 
we have established and documented a process for determining fair value 
we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements 
whenever there is no readily available market data  management uses its best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these financial statements

balance sheet as of december   the company had total consolidated assets of million  total net portfolio loans of million  an alll of million  deposits outstanding of million  and stockholders equity of million 
the company continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during the reporting period 
as of december   the company maintained cash positions at the frb and correspondent banks in the amount of million 
the company also held certificates of deposits with other financial institutions in the amount of million  which the company considers highly liquid 
the company s available for sale investment portfolio is primarily utilized as a source of liquidity to fund other higher yielding asset opportunities  such as mortgage loan originations when required 
investment securities totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the million  or increase reflects net purchase activity relating to the purchases of municipal bonds  corporate securities  and asset backed securities  partially offset by sales activity of mortgage backed securities  u 
s treasuries  and agencies 
during  the company repositioned the porfolio with the objective of preserving the net interest margin while reducing overall portfolio duration 
accordingly  the company recorded million in realized gains on the sales of securities 
at december   the company s net unrealized gain on available for sale securities was million  compared with million net unrealized loss at december  the favorable change in net unrealized gains was primarily due to increases in the fair values of the company s municipal bond portfolio  primarily driven by decreases in long term interest rates  partially offset by decreases in the fair values of corporate securities due to widening of market spreads 
overall  the net portfolio loan balance decreased modestly during compared to the company s net loan portfolio was million at december   compared with million at december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease was primarily driven by net payoffs  and specific charge offs of principal balances 
the company continued to conservatively monitor credit quality during the period  and adjust the alll accordingly 
as such  the company provided million in provisions for loan losses during  compared with million during the company s alll as a percentage of total portfolio loans was and as of december  and  respectively 
net charge offs were million during  compared with net charge offs of million in the charge offs were centered in commercial real estate  commercial  construction loans  and family residential 
overall  the portfolio is showing some signs of stabilization with lingering weaknesses where the borrower s business revenue is tied to real estate 
the commercial real estate loan portfolio and commercial loan portfolio will continue to be influenced by weakness in real estate values  the effects of high unemployment levels  and general overall weakness in economic conditions 
as such  management will continue to aggressively identify and dispose of problematic assets which could lead to an elevated level of charge offs 
despite the current level of charge offs  management believes the company s alll is adequately funded given the current level of credit risk 
the alll methodology and adequacy was recently confirmed during a regulatory examination 
loans held for sale  consisting of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market  were million at december   compared with million at december  the increase in loans held for sale was principally driven by longer warehouse holding periods compared to the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents a major investor exited the market  resulting in a greater inventory of loans in warehouse status 
the mortgage subsidiary had closed loan volume of million and million during and  respectively 
the company s oreo balance at december  was million compared to million at the same period a year ago 
the net increase was primarily driven by the addition of one large commercial real estate property 
see note in the consolidated financial statements incorporated in this report  for further details relating to the company s oreo portfolio 
the company remains committed to working with customers who are experiencing financial difficulties to find potential solutions 
however  the company expects additional foreclosure activity for the foreseeable future 
total deposits as of december  were million compared to million at december   an increase of 
non maturing core deposits increased by  and the company experienced organic growth in time deposits 
during  the company strategically reduced non core brokered certificates of deposits pursuant to an overall organic funding strategy  resulting in a net decrease in total certificates of deposits 
on september   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with the secretary of the treasury  pursuant to which the company issued and sold to the treasury  shares of its senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  having a liquidation preference of  per share  for aggregate proceeds net of issuance costs of million 
the issuance was pursuant to the treasury s small business lending fund program sblf  a billion fund established under the small business jobs act of  which encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than billion 
simultaneously with the sblf funds  the company redeemed the million of shares of senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock series a  issued to the treasury in november under the us treasury s cpp  a part of the troubled asset relief program 
the remainder of the net proceeds were invested by the company in the bank as tier capital 
accordingly  through the sblf transaction  including the liquidation of the series a preferred stock  the company s increased equity from preferred stock by million during sources of income we derive our income from two principal sources net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we receive on interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities  and fee income  which includes fees earned on deposit services  income from payroll processing  electronic based cash management services  mortgage banking income  and merchant credit card processing services 
our income depends to a great extent on net interest income  which correlates strongly with certain interest rate characteristics 
these interest rate characteristics are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  inflation  recession  and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  the federal reserve board in particular 
because of our predisposition to variable rate pricing on our assets and level of time deposits  we are frequently considered asset sensitive  and generally we are affected adversely by declining interest rates 
however  in the current interest rate environment  many of our variable rate loans are priced at their floors 
as a result  we would not experience an immediate benefit in a rising rate environment 
net interest income reflects both our net interest margin  which is the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rate we pay for deposits and other sources of funding  and the amount of earning assets we hold 
as a result  changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold could affect our net interest income and earnings 
increases or decreases in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin 
although the yield we earn on our assets and funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates  one 
table of contents can rise or fall faster than the other  and cause our net interest margin to expand or contract 
many of our assets are tied to prime rate  so they may adjust faster in response to changes in interest rates 
as a result  when interest rates fall  the yield we earn on our assets may fall faster than our ability to reprice a large portion of our liabilities  causing our net interest margin to contract 
changes in the slope of the yield curve  the spread between short term and long term interest rates  could also reduce our net interest margin 
normally  the yield curve is upward sloping  which means that short term rates are lower than long term rates 
because our liabilities tend to be shorter in duration than our assets  when the yield curve flattens or even inverts  we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets 
we assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various simulated scenarios that differ based on assumptions including the direction  magnitude and speed of interest rate changes  and the slope of the yield curve 
there is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings in material amounts  especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than simulated scenarios 
for example  if interest rates rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve changes  we may incur significant losses on debt securities we hold as investments 
to reduce our interest rate risk  we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios  refinance our debt and take other strategic actions which may result in losses or expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  through proactive and aggressive management of problem credits  and the maintenance of a relatively healthy net interest margin  the company has remained profitable during the economic downturn 
as such  the company continues to be well positioned to take advantage of strategic growth opportunities 
net income attributable to bank of commerce holdings was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share eps were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
return on average assets roa and return on average equity roe for the year ended december  was and  respectively compared with and for the same period a year ago 
the increase in roa and roe compared with the same period a year ago  was primarily driven by lower loan loss provision expense  and decreased interest expense on deposits and borrowings  partially offset by decreased yields in the loan portfolio 
the company continues to experience decreased yields in the loan portfolio due to the combination of  downward rate adjustments of variable rate loans  pay offs of higher yielding loans  and reclassification of existing loans to nonaccrual status 
nonperforming assets were million  or of total assets  as of december   compared to million  or of total assets as of december  of this amount  as of december   million represented nonaccrual loans  thousand represented loans past due greater than days and still accruing interest  and million represented oreo 
the company has aggressively charged down impaired assets to their disposition values  and the assets are expected to be resolved at those levels  absent further declines in market prices 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended december  was million  a decrease from the same period a year ago  the decreased loan loss provision reflects general improvement in the loan portfolio  including expected impairment on a prospective basis  and decreased allocations relating to the company s itin portfolio pursuant to the most recent regulatory examination 
the loan portfolio net charge off rate during was  compared to during 
table of contents yields on average earning assets decreased basis points to compared to in the decline in yield of earning assets was primarily driven by decreased yields in the loan portfolio 
the yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points to compared to for the year ended december  the largest loan segment decrease in yield is associated with the company s itin loan portfolio  which had average balances of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the yield on this particular pool of loans decreased basis points from for the full year  to for the full year approximately of the loans in this pool are adjustable rate mortgages that reset during  and will be resetting annually on their respective anniversary dates interest expense on deposits and borrowings declined basis points to in  compared to for interest expense as a percent of average earning assets decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our income is highly dependent on interest rate differentials and the resulting net interest margins ie  the difference between the interest rates earned on the bank s interest earning assets such as loans and securities  and the interest rates paid on the bank s interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
the decrease in interest expense to average earning assets substantially mitigated the effects of the lower yields realized in the loan portfolio 
as a result  the company was able to maintain a relatively consistent net interest margin of for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  during  the company settled the deferred interest rate swap contracts that were transacted in august of  and removed the hedge designation 
as a result of the settlement of the deferred interest rate swap contracts  the company realized million in cash proceeds from the counterparty 
management will reclassify the gains realized on the hedge instruments into earnings from oci  as a reduction of interest expense  in the same periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings on the basis it is probable the forecasted transaction will occur 
as such  the company s margin will benefit from the future reclassifications of these gains by lowering interest expense on fhlb advances 
this benefit is expected to begin in march during  the company entered into a series of deferred starting interest rate swap contracts to mitigate a portion of future interest rate risk 
the contracts were forward starting with the first leg becoming effective on august  management designated the deferred interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges of interest payments 
the company continued to pay dividends on common stock during the year ended december  the annual dividend amount per share decreased from in to in the decrease in the dividend rate was executed to preserve capital  while ensuring that dividend payout ratios remain consistent to periods prior to the common stock offering 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we reported net income of million and net income to common shareholders of million for the year ended december   representing an increase of approximately thousand or  over net income of million and net income to common shareholders of million for the year ended december  during  our net interest margin increased modestly as the company funded earning assets with low cost deposits and wholesale borrowings 
the downward repricing of wholesale borrowings provided positive benefit to our net interest margin 
consistent with  gains on the sale of securities contributed significantly to our earnings 
in  the company also benefited from the settlement of the irrevocable loss guarantee put reserve associated with the itin loan portfolio see note  which increased noninterest income by million 
during  we increased provisions for loan and lease losses significantly 
increased provisions were directly attributed to further deterioration in the commercial and industrial portfolio and continuing weakness in our real 
table of contents estate portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses increased to million in from million in ongoing credit quality reviews and current appraisals identified impairment within the portfolio and significantly contributed to increased provisions in nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased to compared to in the majority of the increase in nonperforming assets was primarily related to the itin loan portfolio 
the recession with the accompanying depressed residential real estate market continued to stress these assets 
accordingly  management pursued an aggressive and prudent stance in monitoring these credits  and continued to do so in return on average assets roa was in and in return on average common equity roe was in compared in diluted eps for and were and  respectively  which reflected a year over year decrease of 
the decrease in diluted eps was a direct result from the additional common shares outstanding 
during  the company successfully completed a public offering of common stock  whereby issuing  of common stock at per share with net equity proceeds of million 
our average total assets increased to million in or from million in total deposits grew by million or over  the deposit growth was centered in noninterest bearing demand accounts and savings accounts 
total gross loans decreased by million or over  decreases in the real estate construction portfolio were offset by increases to the home equity line portfolio  the remaining mix remained consistent with during the first quarter of  the company purchased a pool of performing home equity revolving and non revolving loans which accounted for the majority of the increase in the home equity portfolio 
the yield on the loan portfolio decreased basis points to compared to in yields on all earning assets decreased basis points to compared to in our income is highly dependent on interest rate differentials and the resulting net interest margins ie  the difference between the interest rates earned on the bank s interest earning assets such as loans and securities  and the interest rates paid on the bank s interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors  which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions  inflation  recession and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  in particular  the federal reserve board 
because of our predisposition to variable rate pricing on our assets and level of time deposits  we are normally considered asset sensitive 
however  with the current historically low interest rate environment in  the market rates on many of our variable rate loans were below their respective floors 
consequently  we would not immediately benefit in a rising rate environment 
as such  we were considered liability sensitive in the bp to bp upward rate shock  and asset sensitive for bp upward rate shock 
as a result  management anticipated that  in a rising interest rate environment  our net interest income and margin would have been be expected to decline  as well as in a declining interest rate environment 
however  given that the model assumes a static balance sheet  no assurance can be given that under such circumstances we would experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
during  the company entered into a series of deferred starting interest rate swap contracts to mitigate a portion of future interest rate risk 
the contracts were forward starting with the first one becoming effective on march  management designated the deferred interest rate swap contracts as cash flow hedges of interest payments 
funding costs decreased by basis points to compared with in  reflecting the current lower interest rate environment

the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to the same period a year ago 
the year over year modest decrease in net interest margin primarily resulted from decreased yield on the loan portfolio as a result of payoffs of higher yielding loans  downward rate adjustments on variable rate loans  and transfers to nonaccrual status  substantially offset by a decrease in interest expense to average earning assets 
interest expense as a percent of average earning assets decreased from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense to average earning assets substantially mitigated the effects of the lower yields on the companies loan portfolio

the put reserve was part of the april  loan swap transaction in which the company purchased a pool of itin residential mortgages in exchange for a combination of certain nonperforming loans and cash 
the put reserve was an irrevocable first loss guarantee from the seller that provided us the right to put back delinquent itin loans to the seller that were days or more delinquent up to an aggregate amount of million 
this guarantee was backed by a seller cash deposit with the company that was restricted for this sole purpose 
the seller s cash deposit was classified as a deposit liability in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the term of this loss guarantee  the company was required to return the cash deposit to the seller to the extent not used to fund losses in the itin portfolio 
during the period from march to september  thirteen itin loans with an aggregate principal amount of million were returned to the seller under the loss guarantee  reducing the deposit liability to approximately million prior to reaching the settlement with the seller to eliminate the loss guarantee arrangement

income taxes our provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes and reflects the application of federal and state statutory rates to our income before taxes 
the principal difference between statutory tax rates and our effective tax rate is the benefit derived from investing in tax exempt securities and preferential state tax treatment for qualified enterprise zone loans 
we continue to participate in a california affordable housing project which affords federal and state tax credits

during  the company did not consider the benefit of the state tax deduction when deriving the federal tax provision 
as such  this benefit was recognized during the first quarter of available for sale securities the composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management s investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of interest income 
the investment securities portfolio also mitigates interest rate and a portion of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio  while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds  a source of liquidity by pledging as collateral or through repurchase agreements and collateral for certain public funds deposits

mortgages held for sale are generated through two pipelines bank of commerce mortgage and the bank s mortgage loan early purchase program with bank of commerce mortgage 
in both cases  our majority owned subsidiary bank of commerce mortgage originates residential mortgage loans within bank of commerce s geographic market  as well as on a nationwide basis 
in scenario above  the loans are funded through a warehouse line of credit with the bank or other financial institutions  and are accounted for as loans held for sale at the mortgage subsidiary 
under scenario above  bank of commerce mortgage has a mortgage loan early purchase program agreement with the bank 
in accordance with the agreement  bank of commerce mortgage has agreed to sell the bank undivided participation ownership interests in mortgage loans  without recourse 
the bank then sells the mortgage loans to other investors in the secondary mortgage market 
the maximum amount of loans the bank will own a participation interest in at any time may not exceed of the bank s total risk based capital 
at december  and bank of commerce mortgage had sold the bank a participation interest in loans amounting to million and million  respectively  which were not resold by the bank 

table of contents all mortgage loans originated through either pipeline represent loans collateralized by family residential real estate and are made to borrowers in good credit standing 
these loans are typically sold to primary mortgage market aggregators fannie mae fnma  freddie mac fhlmc  and ginnie mae gnma and to third party investors including the servicing rights 
accordingly  there are no separately recognized servicing assets or liabilities resulting from the sale of mortgage loans 
mortgages held for sale are either carried at fair value or at the lower of cost or market 
mortgage loans carried at fair value represent certain loans that the company has elected to utilize the fair value option 
these represent mandatory loans that were not locked forward with an investor at the time of borrower lock commitment mandatory rate locks 
these loans are to be sold to investors subject to mandatory forward sales agreements 
fair value adjustments are made for the difference between the estimated fair value of the mandatory loans committed price and the cost basis of these loans  and are recorded in mortgage banking revenue under the caption noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized upon the sale of the loan in mortgage banking revenue  under the caption noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the company had million in mortgage loans that were carried at a fair value of million 
for those loans carried at lower of cost or market  cost generally approximates fair value  given the short duration of these assets 
gains and losses on sales of these loans are recorded in mortgage banking revenue  under the caption of noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at origination of the loan and are recognized upon the sale of the loan in mortgage banking revenue  under the caption of noninterest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
servicing rights associated with the mortgage loans are generally sold 
as of december   the company had million in mortgages that were held for sale and carried at lower of cost or market 
asset quality nonperforming assets while the company s loan portfolio is well diversified  a significant portion of the borrowers ability to repay the loans is dependent upon the professional services  commercial real estate market and the residential real estate development industry sectors 
the loans are secured by real estate or other assets primarily located in california and are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrower or proceeds from the sale of collateral 
as such  the company s dependence on real estate increases the risk of loss in the loan portfolio of the company 
furthermore  declining real estate values negatively impact holdings of oreo as well 
continuing deterioration of the california real estate market has had an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the continued slowdown in residential development and construction markets has led to an elevated level of nonperforming loans resulting in elevated provisions to the alll 
management has taken cautious yet decisive steps to ensure the proper funding of loan reserves 
given our current business environment  management s top focus is on credit quality  expense control  and bottom line net income 
all of these are affected either directly or indirectly by the company s management of its asset quality 
we manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices 
the bank s credit roundtable committee is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the 
table of contents adequacy of the alll 
reviews of nonperforming  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the alll  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a monthly basis 
these reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
our loan portfolio continues to be impacted by the anemic economic recovery  and continued significant weaknesses in our local real estate markets 
nonperforming loans  which include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due over days  totaled million or of total portfolio loans as of december   as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  nonperforming assets  which include nonperforming loans and foreclosed real estate other real estate owned  totaled million  or of total assets as of december  compared with million  or of total assets as of december  a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
generally  when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the loan for potential impairment using discount cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of collateral  less selling costs 
the starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is through obtaining external appraisals 
generally  external appraisals are updated every six to twelve months 
we obtain appraisals from a pre approved list of independent  third party  local appraisal firms 
approval and addition to the list is based on experience  reputation  character  consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market 
at a minimum  it is ascertained that the appraiser is currently licensed in the state in which the property is located  is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised  is actively engaged in the appraisal work  has knowledge of current real estate market conditions and financing trends  is reputable  and is not on freddie mac s nor the bank s exclusionary list of appraisers and brokers 
in certain cases appraisals will be reviewed by another independent third party to ensure the quality of the appraisal and the expertise and independence of the appraiser 
upon receipt and review  an external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment 
our impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis  whether the officer preparing the report deems it current  and  if not  allows for internal valuation adjustments with justification 
typical justified adjustments might include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date  adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal  or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal 
an appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required 
any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis  which is reviewed and approved by senior credit quality officers and the company s credit roundtable committee 
although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans  we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements  negotiated short sales  broker price opinions  or the sales price of the note 
these alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution 
impairment analyses are updated  reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis at or near the end of each reporting period 
based on these processes  we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional loan loss provisions or charge offs from the date they become known 
loans are classified as nonaccrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful  generally these are loans that are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by days or more  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
additionally  all loans that are impaired are considered for nonaccrual status 
loans placed on nonaccrual will typically remain on nonaccrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear relatively certain 

table of contents the company practices one exception to the days past due policy for nonaccruals when assessing credit quality relating to the pool of home equity loans and lines purchased from a private equity firm  the arrow loans 
loans in this pool are charged off when they become days past due 
these loans are considered unsecured  and management believes at the point of days past due  they become uncollectable for all principal and interest 
upon acquisition of real estate collateral  typically through the foreclosure process  we promptly begin to market the property for sale 
if we do not begin to receive offers or indications of interest we will analyze the price and review market conditions to assess whether a lower price reflects the market value of the property and would enable us to sell the property 
in addition  we update appraisals on oreo property six to twelve months after the most recent appraisal 
increases in valuation adjustments recorded in a period are primarily based on a updated appraisals received during the period  or b management s authorization to reduce the selling price of the property during the period 
unless a current appraisal is available  an appraisal will be ordered prior to a loan moving to oreo 
foreclosed properties held as oreo are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loan or market value of the property less expected selling costs 
oreo at december  totaled million and consisted of properties

the company is continually performing extensive reviews of our commercial real estate portfolio  including stress testing 
these reviews are being performed on both our non owner and owner occupied credits 
these reviews are being completed to verify leasing status  to ensure the accuracy of risk ratings  and to develop proactive action plans with borrowers on projects 
the stress testing has been performed to determine the effect of rising cap rates  interest rates  and vacancy rates  on this portfolio 
based on our analysis  the company believes our lending teams are effectively managing the risks in this portfolio 
there can be no assurance that any 
table of contents further declines in economic conditions  such as potential increases in retail or office vacancy rates  will not exceed the projected assumptions utilized in stress testing resulting in additional nonperforming loans in the future 
on march   the company completed a loan swap transaction which included the purchase of a pool of residential mortgage home equity loans with a par value of million 
as of december   the company had million in alll allocations against this pool or of the outstanding principal balance 
an accompanying million put reserve was also part of the loan swap transaction and represented a credit enhancement 
however  as of december   the put reserve was depleted 
the put reserve was considered an irrevocable first loss guarantee from the seller that provided the company the right to put back delinquent home equity loans to the seller that were days or more delinquent  up to an aggregate amount of million 
the guarantee is backed by a seller cash deposit with the company that is restricted for this sole purpose 
the seller s cash deposit was classified as a deposit liability in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the term of the loss guarantee  on march   the company would have been required to return the unused cash deposit to the seller 
as such  management no longer considers the put reserve in estimating probable losses in the home equity portfolio 
the itin loans represent a purchased pool of residential mortgage loans made to legal united states residents without a social security number  and are geographically dispersed throughout the united states 
the itin loan portfolio is serviced through a third party 
worsening economic conditions in the united states may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our itin loans and reduce the value of the assets that we hold as collateral 
in addition  if we are forced to foreclose and service these itin properties ourselves  we may realize additional monitoring  servicing and appraisal costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which will adversely affect our noninterest expense 
as part of the original itin loan transaction  we obtained an irrevocable first loss guarantee from the seller that provided us the right to put back delinquent itin loans to the seller that were days or more delinquent up to an aggregate amount of million 
this guarantee was backed by a seller cash deposit with the company that was restricted for this sole purpose 
the seller s cash deposit was classified as a deposit liability in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at the end of the term of this loss guarantee  the company was required to return the cash deposit to the seller to the extent not used to fund losses in the itin portfolio 
the company accounted for the loans returned to the seller under the loss guarantee by derecognizing the loan  debiting cash and derecognizing the deposit liability 
during the period from march to august  thirteen itin loans with an aggregate principal amount of million were returned to the seller under the loss guarantee  reducing the deposit liability to approximately million prior to reaching a settlement with the seller to eliminate the loss guarantee arrangement 
at the date of settlement  august  the company received million in cash and returned thousand in cash to the seller from the deposit account 
accordingly  the company recognized a gain upon settlement 
as such  no portion of the remaining outstanding principal balance of the itin loan portfolio has an accompanying loss guarantee as of december  during  in conjunction with settlement of the loss guarantee  million was expensed in provisions for loan losses  and specifically allocated in the alll against the itin portfolio 
the gain on settlement and the increase in loan loss provisions were two separate and distinct events 
however  the two events are linked because upon eliminating the irrevocable loss guarantee from the seller  an increase in the alll related to the itin loans was necessary 
immediately subsequent to the termination of the irrevocable loss guarantee  the following factors were considered in determining the specific alll allocation to the itin portfolio increasing delinquencies of the portfolio was delinquent days or more as of december  servicer modification efforts were generally extending beyond a typical timeframe 
mortgage insurance a small number of mortgage insurance claims were denied and management was not able to identify a trend regarding any potential future denials 

table of contents sale of oreo an emerging trend in the lengthening disposition of itin oreo had developed  including the potential for decreased recoveries and consequently increased net charge offs 
lack of loss guaranty due to settlement 
as of december   and december   the specific itin alll allocation represented approximately and of the total outstanding principal  respectively 
during the company s most recent regulatory examination concluded in july  bank examiners concurred with management s revised assessment regarding the required level of the general valuation allowance on the itin portfolio 
accordingly  with regulatory approval  management reduced the itin allowance allocation 
a number of quantitative and qualitative factors were evaluated and considered in determining the current level of the general valuation allowances  including net losses net charge offs are relatively low with a current historical run rate of 
mortgage insurance claims mortgage insurance claims have generally been settled within a day timeframe after submission 
in addition  the company has experienced a rescission rate which compares favorably to the mortgage insurance company s published rate in excess of 
delinquency rate of over the life of the portfolio 
modified mortgages the re default rate on modified itin loans approximates  which is well below the national re default rate of as of december   impaired loans totaled million  of which million were in nonaccrual status 
of the total impaired loans  million or one hundred and fifty one were itin loans with an average balance of approximately thousand 
the remaining impaired loans consist of one commercial loan  three construction loans  thirteen commercial real estate loans  thirteen residential mortgages and eight home equity loans 
loans are reported as troubled debt restructurings tdr when the bank grants a concession s to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that it would not otherwise consider 
examples of such concessions include a reduction in the loan rate  forgiveness of principal or accrued interest  extending the maturity date s significantly  or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for a transaction of similar risk 
as a result of these concessions  restructured loans are impaired as the bank will not collect all amounts due  both principal and interest  in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement 
impairment reserves on non collateral dependent restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows of the restructured loans  discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan agreement 
these impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the alll 
at december  and december   impaired loans of million and million were classified as performing restructured loans  respectively 
the restructurings were granted in response to borrower financial difficulty  and generally provide for a temporary modification of loan repayment terms 
the performing restructured loans on accrual status represent the majority of impaired loans accruing interest at each respective date 
in order for a restructured loan to be considered performing and on accrual status  the loan s collateral coverage generally will be greater than or equal to of the loan balance  the loan is current on payments  and the borrower must either prefund an interest reserve or demonstrate the ability to make payments from a verified source of cash flow 
the company had no obligations to lend additional funds on the restructured loans as of december  as of december   there were million of itins which were classified as tdrs  of which million were on nonaccrual status 
as of december   the company had million in tdrs compared to million as of december  as of december   the company had one hundred and fifteen restructured loans that qualified as tdrs  of which eighty one were performing according to their restructured terms

the decrease in the alll as of december  as compared to prior year is principally attributable to net charge offs exceeding provisions for loan and lease losses for the year 
there were a number of factors that contributed to the decreased provisions  including improved credit quality indicators  regulatory  aggressive dispositions  and charge offs of impairment

table of contents all impaired loans are individually evaluated for impairment 
if the measurement of each impaired loan s value is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we recognize this impairment and adjust the carrying value of the loan to fair value through the alll 
this can be accomplished by charging off the impaired portion of the loan or establishing a specific component within the alll 
if in management s assessment the sources of repayment will not result in a reasonable probability that the carrying value of a loan can be recovered  the amount of a loan s specific impairment is charged off against the alll 
prior to the downturn in our local real estate markets  the company established specific reserves within the allowance for loan and leases losses for loan impairments and recognized the charge off of the impairment reserve when the loan was resolved  sold  or foreclosed and transferred to oreo 
due to declining real estate values in our markets and the deterioration of the us economy in general  it became increasingly likely that impairment reserves on collateral dependent loans  particularly those relating to real estate  would not be recoverable and represented a confirmed loss 
as a result  within the proceeding three years  the company began recognizing the charge off of impairment reserves on impaired loans in the period they arise for collateral dependent loans 
this process has effectively accelerated the recognition of charge offs recognized since the change in our assessment of the possible recoverability of our collateral dependent impaired loans carrying values has ultimately had no impact on our impairment valuation procedures or the amount of provision for loan and leases losses included within the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment reserves on non collateral dependent restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows on the restructured loans discounted at the interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loan s carrying value 
these impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the alll 
at december   the recorded investment in loans classified as impaired totaled million  with a corresponding valuation allowance included in the alll of million 
the valuation allowance on impaired loans represents the impairment reserves on performing restructured loans  other accruing loans  and nonaccrual loans 
at december   the total recorded investment in impaired loans was million  with a corresponding valuation allowance included in the alll of million 
on a year over year basis  our total charge offs remained consistent 
the majority of loan charge offs in the current year relate to real estate related credits 
in the current year we experienced decreased charge offs in commercial loans and to lesser extent residential loans  partially offset by increased charge offs in commercial real estate loans 
these charge offs were largely driven by economic conditions coupled with falling real estate values in our markets 
the majority of all charge offs taken in the current year relate to borrowers that were directly affected by the housing market downturn or indirectly impacted from the contraction of real estate dependent businesses

table of contents the unallocated portion of alll provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk rating based component  or in the specific impairment reserve component of the alll  and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models 
as of december   the unallocated allowance amount represented of the alll  compared to at december  the level in unallocated alll in the current year reflects management s evaluation of the existing general business and economic conditions  and declining credit quality and collateral values of real estate in our markets 
the alll composition should not be interpreted as an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs may occur

with the additional proceeds from the exercise of the over allotment option  the company realized total net proceeds from the offering of approximately million  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
the exercise of the over allotment option brought the total number of shares of common stock sold by the company in the offering to  on september   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with the secretary of the treasury  pursuant to which the company issued and sold to the treasury  shares of its senior non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b the series b preferred stock  having a liquidation preference of  per share  for aggregate proceeds net of issuance costs of million 
the issuance was pursuant to the treasury s small business lending fund program sblf  a billion fund established under the small business jobs act of  which encourages lending to small businesses by providing capital to qualified community banks with assets of less than billion 
simultaneously with the sblf funds  the company redeemed the million of shares of the series a preferred stock  issued to the treasury in november under the us treasury s capital purchase program cpp  a part of the troubled asset relief program 
the remainder of the net proceeds was invested by the company in the bank as tier capital 
the series b preferred stock is entitled to receive non cumulative dividends payable quarterly on each january  april  july and october  beginning october  the dividend rate  which is calculated on the aggregate liquidation amount  has been initially set at per annum based upon the current level of qualified small business lending qsbl by the bank 
the dividend rate for future dividend periods will be set based upon the percentage change in qualified lending between each dividend period and the baseline qsbl level established at the time the agreement was entered into 
such dividend rate may vary from per annum to per annum for the second through tenth dividend periods  and from per annum to per annum for the eleventh through the first half of the nineteenth dividend periods 
if the series b preferred stock remains outstanding for more than four and one half years  the dividend rate will be fixed at 
prior to that time  in general  the dividend rate decreases as the level of the bank s qsbl increases 
such dividends are not cumulative  but the company may only declare and pay dividends on its common stock or any other equity securities junior to the series b preferred stock if it has declared and paid dividends for the current dividend period on the series b preferred stock  and will be subject to other restrictions on its ability to repurchase or redeem other securities 
in addition  if the company has not timely declared and paid dividends on the series b preferred stock for six dividend periods or more  whether or not consecutive  and shares of series b preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of at least million are still outstanding  the treasury or any successor holder of series b preferred stock may designate two additional directors to be elected to the company s board of directors 

table of contents as more completely described in the certificate of designation  holders of the series b preferred stock have the right to vote as a separate class on certain matters relating to the rights of holders of series b preferred stock and on certain corporate transactions 
except with respect to such matters and  if applicable  the election of the additional directors described above  the series b preferred stock does not have voting rights 
the company may redeem the shares of series b preferred stock  in whole or in part  at any time at a redemption price equal to the sum of the liquidation amount per share and the per share amount of any unpaid dividends for the then current period  subject to any required prior approval by the company s primary federal banking regulator 
on october   the company repurchased and retired the common stock warrant issued to the us treasury pursuant to the tarp cpp  for thousand 
together with the company s redemption in september of the entire amount of series a preferred stock issued to the us treasury  represents full repayment of all tarp obligations 
although we are periodically engaged in discussions with potential acquisition candidates  we are not currently party to any purchase or merger agreement 
with our strong capital position  we are constantly seeking new opportunities to increase franchise value through loan growth  investment portfolio purchases  and core deposits 
periodically  the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares 
share repurchase announcements are published in press releases and sec k filings 
typically we do not give any public notice before repurchasing shares 
various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases  including our capital requirements  market conditions and legal considerations 
these factors can change at any time and there can be no assurance as to the number of shares repurchased or the timing of the repurchases 
our policy has been to repurchase shares under the safe harbor conditions of rule b of the exchange act including a limitation on the daily volume of repurchases 
the company s potential sources of capital include retained earnings  common and preferred stock issuance and issuance of subordinated debt and trust notes 
on february   the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the purchase of up to  or of its outstanding shares over a twelve month period 
the stock repurchase plan authorizes the company to conduct open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions from time to time when  at management s discretion  it is determined that market conditions and other factors warrant such purchases 
purchased shares will be held in treasury 
there is no guarantee as to the exact number of shares to be purchased  and the stock repurchase plan may be modified  suspended  or terminated without prior notice 
during  the company s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share per quarter 
these dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of  among other things  earnings  regulatory capital levels  capital preservation  expected growth  and the overall payout ratio 
we expect that the dividend rate will be reassessed on a quarterly basis by the board of directors in accordance with the dividend policy 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the dividend restrictions section of part i of this report 
there is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rates 
the risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our banking business  our asset liability management alm process  and credit risk mitigation activities 
traditional loan and deposit products are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities 
these positions are subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk is the effect of changes in economic value of our loans and deposits  as well as our other interest rate sensitive instruments and is reflected in the levels of future income and expense produced by these positions versus levels that would be generated by current levels of interest rates 
we seek to mitigate interest rate risk as part of the alm process 
interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our financial instruments 
our overall goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect net interest income 
interest rates risk is measured as the potential volatility in our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
lending and deposit gathering creates interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet 
interest rate risk from these activities as well as the impact of ever changing market conditions is mitigated using the alm process 
we do not operate a trading account and do not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange or commodities 
we face market risk through interest rate volatility 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for our interest rate risk management policies 
we have an alco committee which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
the internal alco roundtable group maintains a net interest income forecast using different rate scenarios via a simulation model 
this group updates the net interest income forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic and market conditions 
the simulation model used includes measures of the expected re pricing characteristics of administered rate now  savings and money market accounts and non related products demand deposit accounts  other assets and other liabilities 
these measures recognize the relative sensitivity of these accounts to changes in market interest rates  as demonstrated through current and historical experience  recognizing the timing differences of rate changes 
in the simulation of net interest margin and net income the forecast balance sheet is processed against five rate scenarios 
these five rate scenarios include a flat rate environment  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future and four additional rate ramp scenarios ranging for to basis points in basis point increments  unless the rate environment cannot move in these basis point increments before reaching zero 
the formal policies and practices we adopted to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure measure risk in two ways re pricing opportunities for earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and changes in net interest income for declining interest rate shocks of to basis points 
because of our predisposition to variable rate pricing and noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts  we are normally considered asset sensitive 
however  with the current historically low interest rate environment  the market rates on many of our variable rate loans are below their respective floors 
consequently  we would not immediately benefit in a rising rate environment 
additionally  the bank uses short term fhlb borrowings to fund the short term financing needs of our mortgage loan division 
as such  we are currently considered liability sensitive in the bp to bp upward rate shock 
as a result  management anticipates that  in a rising interest rate environment  our net interest income and margin would generally be expected to decline  as well as in a declining interest rate environment 
however  given that the model assumes a static balance sheet  no assurance can be given that under such circumstances we would experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
to estimate the effect of interest rate shocks on our net interest income  management uses a model to prepare an analysis of interest rate risk exposure 
such analysis calculates the change in net interest income given a change 
table of contents in the federal funds rate of   or basis points up or down 
all changes are measured in dollars and are compared to projected net interest income 
the most recent model results  at december   indicate the estimated annualized reduction in net interest income attributable to a   and basis point declines in the federal funds rate was    and  respectively 
at december   the estimated annualized reduction in net interest income attributable to a   and basis point decline in the federal funds rate was    and  respectively 
the federal reserve currently has the federal funds rate targeted between zero to twenty five basis points 
accordingly  the company is focused on the affects of interest rate shocks on our net interest income during a rising rate environment 
the most recent model results  as december   indicate the estimated annualized decrease in net interest income attributable to a    and basis point increases in the federal funds rate was    and  respectively 
the model utilized by management to create the analysis described in the preceding paragraphs uses balance sheet simulation to estimate the impact of changing rates on our projected annual net interest income actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the alco has established a policy limitation to interest rate risk of of the net interest margin and of the present value of equity 
the securities portfolio is integral to our asset liability management process 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment  liquidity  regulatory requirements and the relative mix of our cash positions 
the following table sets forth the most recent model results relating to the distribution of re pricing opportunities for the bank s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it also reports the gap different volumes of rate sensitive assets and liabilities re pricing interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at different time intervals  the cumulative gap  the ratio of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities for each re pricing interval  and the cumulative gap to total assets 
gap analysis dollars in thousands within months months to one year one year to five years over five years total interest earning assets available for sale securities other investments loans  gross total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities gap in dollars cumulative gap in dollars as a percentage of earning assets gap ratio n a cumulative gap ratio gap as of earning assets cumulative gap as of earning assets 
table of contents management believes that the short duration of its rate sensitive assets and liabilities contributes to its ability to re price a significant amount of its rate sensitive assets and liabilities and mitigate the impact of rate changes in excess of    or basis points 
the model s primary benefit to management is its assistance in evaluating the impact that future strategies with respect to our mix and level of rate sensitive assets and liabilities will have on our net interest income 
our approach to managing interest rate risk may include the use of derivatives  including interest rate swaps  caps and floors 
this helps to minimize significant  unplanned fluctuations in earnings  fair values of assets and liabilities and cash flows caused by interest rate volatility 
this approach involves an off balance sheet instrument with the same characteristics of certain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates do not have a significant adverse effect on the net interest margin and cash flows 
as a result of interest rate fluctuations  hedged assets and liabilities will gain or lose market value 
in a fair value hedging strategy  the effect of this unrealized gain or loss will generally be offset by income or loss on the derivatives linked to the hedged assets and liabilities 
for a cash flow hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative to the extent that it is effective is recorded through oci 
at inception  the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items is formally documented with our risk management objective  strategy and our evaluation of effectiveness of the hedge transactions 
this includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific transactions 
periodically  as required  we formally assess whether the derivative we designated in the hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item
