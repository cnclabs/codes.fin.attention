table of contents results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal acquisition of delta plc on may   we acquired delta plc delta 
the total amount of the acquisition was million and was financed by a combination of cash  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement of million and million of senior unsecured notes 
we began consolidating delta s financial results in our consolidated financial statements beginning on may  on a segment reporting basis  delta s operations are included in our results as follows engineered infrastructure products eip segment manufacture of poles  roadway safety systems and access systems  utility support structures utility segment manufacture of pole structures  coatings segment galvanizing operations in australia  the us and asia  and other manufacture of steel grinding media and electrolytic manganese dioxide the increases in sales and operating income by segment attributable to a full year effect of delta in fiscal  as compared with fiscal  were as follows in millions fiscal year ended december  net sales operating income engineered infrastructure products eip utility support structures uss coatings other net corporate expense total overview on a consolidated basis  the increase in net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was primarily the result of improved sales in all reportable segments  part of which was the result of delta s financial results being included in our consolidated financial statements for all of in addition  fiscal included weeks of operations  as compared with fiscal  which was weeks 
this was the result of our fiscal year end being on the last saturday in december 
accordingly  all fiscal operational figures were higher than had fiscal been weeks in length 
the estimated impact on our net sales and net earnings due to the extra week of fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively 
for the company as a whole  without consideration of delta  our increase over was mainly due to increased unit sales volumes of approximately million 
on a reportable segment basis  the most significant unit sales volume increase were in the irrigation and uss segments 
sales prices overall were up modestly in fiscal  as compared with  mainly in response to rising steel prices 
in the aggregate  the sales increase in  as compared with  due to price increases and sales mix changes was approximately million 

table of contents our fiscal sales and operating income in comparison to were enhanced by foreign currency translation 
on average  the us dollar was weaker than most global currencies in as compared with these effects by segment were as follows in millions of dollars net sales operating income engineered infrastructure products utility support structures coatings irrigation other corporate total the decrease in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal  as compared with  was due to higher average raw material costs in as compared with in particular  steel prices rose significantly in the first quarter of before moderating somewhat in the following two quarters 
average zinc costs also were higher in than in these higher costs were not recovered entirely through increased selling prices  mainly due to a competitive selling price environment  especially in the eip and utility segments 
in the aggregate  we estimate that the impact of these factors in  as compared with  was approximately million 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the following factors expenses associated with the full year delta operations million in our consolidated accounts in  increased employee incentive accruals of million  due to improved operating results  and  increased compensation expenses of million  associated with increased employment levels and salary increases 
these increases were somewhat offset by million in lower acquisition and integration costs in the fiscal  as compared with  associated with the delta acquisition 
the increase in operating income on a reportable segment basis in  as compared with  was due to improved operating performance in the irrigation  utility and coatings segments reported improved operating income in fiscal  as compared with the eip segment operating income in was lower than fiscal the other category also reported improved operating profit in  as the grinding media  tubing and manganese dioxide operations were improved over currency translation effects also contributed to the increase in operating income in fiscal  as compared with  of approximately million 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal  as compared with  was attributable to million of expense incurred when we redeemed our senior subordinated debt  million of expense related to the full year effect of interest expense associated with the million in senior unsecured notes issued in april  less  million of bank fees incurred in the first quarter of fiscal to provide the required bridge loan funding commitment for the delta acquisition and the full year effect of interest income from delta s cash balances approximately million 

table of contents the increase in other expense in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to investment losses in the assets held in our deferred compensation plan of million 
the decrease in the value of these assets was offset by a corresponding decrease in our deferred compensation liabilities  which were reflected as a decrease in net corporate expense 
accordingly  there was no effect on net earnings from these investment losses 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of currency translation losses due the dissolution of our joint venture in turkey 
our effective income tax rate in fiscal was substantially lower than this reduction was mainly due to tax benefits associated with a legal restructuring of delta in the fourth quarter of the restructuring was completed to gain certain operational efficiencies and resulted in an aggregate income tax benefit of million related to an increase in the tax basis of assets in australia and removing valuation allowances to certain uk deferred tax assets associated with tax loss carryforwards 
the restructuring will allow us to generate uk based income sufficient to utilize those tax loss carryforwards 
see critical accounting policies income taxes for a more detailed discussion of the legal restructuring and the associated tax 
in  we realized an unfavorable effect in related to non deductibility of a portion of the delta acquisition expenses approximately million 
in  the following items resulted in favorable effects to income taxes income tax benefits associated with our acquisition of the remaining of donhad that we did not own million  income tax provisions in our south african manganese dioxide operation that were no longer needed due to a favorable tax authority ruling million  net effect of certain income tax contingencies in that were reduced due to expiration of statutes of limitation million 
aside from these events that are non recurring in nature  we believe our effective tax rate in fiscal and would have been approximately 
earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests was higher in  as compared with  mainly due to improved earnings in our manganese dioxide operation  which is owned by noncontrolling interests 
earnings in non consolidated subsidiaries improved in  as compared with  as our owned manganese materials operation experienced improved profitability 
the improvement in net earnings and earnings per share in  as compared with  were mainly attributed to the improved operating income and the tax benefits associated with the legal entity restructuring in million and per share  respectively 
see critical accounting policies income taxes for a more detailed discussion of the legal restructuring and the associated tax effects 
our cash flows provided by operations were approximately million in  as compared with million in while net earnings increased in  as compared with  operating cash flow was slightly lower than due mainly to the following factors higher levels of working capital to support increased business activity in the utility and irrigation segments in the income tax benefits associated with the legal entity restructuring completed in the fourth quarter of million were non cash in nature  and  contributions to the delta pension plan of million in engineered infrastructure products eip segment the increase in net sales in fiscal as compared with was mainly due to the full year effect of the delta operations and currency translation effects 
global lighting markets continue to 
table of contents experience relatively weak demand  resulting in increased price competition  despite higher raw material prices 
in the lighting product line  north american sales in were down slightly as compared with market conditions in north america continue to be weak  especially in the transportation market  where funding is through federal  state and local governments 
we believe sales demand in the transportation market was dampened by the lack of a long term federal highway funding legislation and state budget deficits  as the lack of long term funding legislation does not give the various states ample visibility to implement long term initiatives 
furthermore  highway spending sponsored under the federal program requires the various states to provide part of required funding 
many states are in budget deficits  which may constrain their ability to access federal matching funds to implement roadway projects 
sales in other market channels helped to offset the lower transportation market sales in  as compared with in europe  sales were approximately million higher in fiscal  as compared with  most of which was related to increased sales volumes 
however  sales pricing and product mix generally were unfavorable in light of higher material costs  due to weaker infrastructure spending in europe related to budget deficit control measures and public debt issues 
communication product line sales in fiscal were comparable to north america sales were slightly higher in than while market conditions were generally more favorable in as compared with  we believe uncertainty surrounding the at t t mobile merger has caused demand for communication structures and components to slow down in the last half of in china  sales of wireless communication structures were slightly higher in fiscal  as compared with in  annual supply contracts with chinese wireless carriers were settled later than in the past and was more in line with what we believe is a more normal demand pattern 
sales in the access systems product line in australia in were comparable with  not including the full year effect from the delta acquisition  as industrial construction was overall stable and mining investment was in the early stages of project feasibility and scope 
asia sales in this product line were higher by approximately million in as compared with  as markets in the region generally were stronger  particularly in china  indonesia and the middle east 
sales of highway safety products in were comparable with in local currency terms  not including the full year effect from the delta acquisition 
floods in parts of australia affected infrastructure spending in the first two quarters of  as public spending priorities shifted from roadway development to supporting recovery from the floods 
operating income for the segment in fiscal was lower as compared with while operating income was enhanced by the full year effect of the delta operations and currency translation effects  the impact of higher raw material costs  slowness in demand and very competitive pricing conditions in most of our lighting markets hampered operating income for the segment by approximately million in  as compared with the operating income associated with the delta operations  aside from the full year effect of the acquisition  was comparable with the strong australian dollar led to pricing and margin pressures  as imported products from outside of australia were more competitive from a pricing standpoint 
in europe  we were affected by competitive pricing pressures that negatively affected segment operating profit by approximately million in  as compared with the increase in sg a expense in fiscal was mainly due to the acquisition of the delta operations million  currency translation effects of million and the fourth quarter write down of the pirod trade name of million 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales increase in fiscal  as compared with  was due to improved unit sales volumes in the us  offset to a degree by lower sales prices in the us and lower sales volumes in international markets 
in us markets  electrical utility companies are increasing their 
table of contents investment in the electrical grid over a relatively slow the sales pricing environment is slowly improving but continues to be very competitive 
our sales in were somewhat reflective of market conditions in when certain utility structures projects were awarded at relatively low prices 
in total  we experienced slightly lower average selling prices on our sales  as compared with approximately million 
in international markets  the sales decrease was mainly due to lower project sales into emerging markets of approximately million 
operating income in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the substantial increase in north america sales volume and associated operational leverage 
gross profit margins were negatively affected by the competitive pricing environment in north america and higher raw material costs 
the increase in sg a expense for the segment in fiscal was higher than in  mainly due to increased employee incentives million associated with the increase in operating income and million in increased compensation expenses 
coatings segment net sales in the coatings segment increased in fiscal  as compared with  mainly due to the full year effect of the delta operations and currency translation effects and improved sales volumes in north america and asia pacific 
unit pricing effects on sales for the segment were not significant in  as compared with the increase in segment operating income in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to the effects of currency translation and improved productivity and operating leverage through volume increases 
higher average zinc costs in  as compared with  were largely recovered through productivity improvements 
the increase in operating income in fiscal  as compared with  also was due to the effect of the acquired delta operations 
sg a expenses for the segment in fiscal were higher than the comparable periods in  mainly due to the effect of the delta businesses million  incentives due to improved operating income million and the write down of the industrial galvanizers of america trade name million in in  one of our galvanizing facilities in australia incurred damages from a storm and a fire later in the year 
a property damage and business interruption claim was filed with our insurance carrier and settlement of the claim is ongoing 
we made the necessary capital expenditures to restore the facility and operations commenced late in the fourth quarter of the insurance claim proceeds agreed to with the insurance carrier in exceeded the net book value of the assets damaged 
the financial effect of this event resulted in an improvement in segment operating results in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to improved sales volumes of approximately million 
the remainder of the sales increase was associated with pricing to recover higher raw material costs and favorable product mix approximately million and currency translation effects approximately million 
in global markets  the sales growth was due to a very strong agricultural economies around the world 
farm commodity prices were generally favorable throughout and net farm income was at record levels in the united states and favorable in most markets 
we believe that farm commodity prices have been favorable due to strong demand  including consumption in the production of ethanol and other fuels  and traditionally low inventories of major farm commodities 
in addition  weather conditions in north america in were generally drier than  further enhancing demand for irrigation machines and related service parts 
in international markets  the sales improvement in fiscal  as compared with  was realized in most markets  particularly in asia pacific and south america 

table of contents operating income for the segment improved in over  due to improved sales unit volumes in north america and the associated operational leverage 
the most significant reasons for the increase in sg a expense in  as compared with  was related to employee compensation costs to support the increase in sales activity and future initiatives million and increased employee incentives due to improved operating performance in million 
other this unit includes the delta grinding media and electrolytic manganese operations and our industrial tubing and fasteners operations 
the increase in sales in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due improved sales volumes in all of these operations and currency translation effects approximately million 
fiscal operating income improved due to the full year effect of the delta operations  improved operating results in the manganese dioxide and tubing operations and currency translation approximately million 
net corporate expense net corporate expense in fiscal was comparable to corporate expenses decreased in fiscal  as compared with  due to delta acquisition and integration costs that were incurred in million but not and lower deferred compensation expense million 
these decreases were offset somewhat by the full year effect of delta s administration costs million and higher employee incentive expense associated with improved profitability in as compared with million and increased compensation expenses million 
fiscal compared with fiscal acquisition of delta plc on march   we made an offer to acquire all the ordinary shares of delta plc delta  a public company traded on the london stock exchange under the symbol dlta 
the offer price was per ordinary share  with a total estimated purchase price of million 
to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with the offer  we executed a forward foreign exchange contract with a multinational bank  whereby  if the acquisition was completed  the required british pound sterling would be delivered to us at a fixed exchange rate of to complete the acquisition 
in accordance with takeover rules in the united kingdom  we established funding for the purchase price and related acquisition costs by a combination of million in restricted cash comprised of cash balances of million and million in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and a million bank bridge loan commitment 
in april  we issued million of senior unsecured notes  terminated the bridge loan and reduced our revolving credit agreement borrowings to approximately million 
we completed the acquisition on may  and we now own of delta s ordinary shares 
in december  we acquired all of delta s preference shares for approximately million approximately million 
we began consolidating delta s financial results in our consolidated financial statements on may  delta s sales included in our consolidated results for the period of may  to december  were million 
delta s operating income over the same period was million and includes approximately million of expenses related to amortization  depreciation and other items related to purchase accounting adjustments 
at december   we recast our reportable segments to align with our management reporting structure  as a result of this reorganization  delta s galvanizing operations in the us  asia and australia are reported as part of our coatings segment  
table of contents engineered steel products operations for structures and access systems are reported as part of the engineered infrastructure products segment  grinding media and manganese dioxide operations are reported as other  and head office administration expenses including expenses associated with the delta pension plan are reported as part of net corporate expense 
in fiscal  certain other expenses were incurred in our consolidated statement of operations that were associated with the delta acquisition 
these expenses included sg a expenses of million related to acquisition costs such as investment banking fees  due diligence costs and other expenses directly associated with the acquisition and integration of delta with valmont 
these costs  under applicable accounting standards  are required to be recorded as expenses as incurred 
interest expenses aggregating million incurred in fiscal related to fees and expenses to establish the bridge loan and borrowing costs incurred to finance the acquisition prior to the may  acquisition date 
the after tax impact of these expenses on our net earnings in fiscal was approximately million 
overview on a consolidated basis  the net sales increase in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to the acquisition of delta  which contributed million in net sales beginning may   improved sales unit volumes in the irrigation and coatings segments  and lower sales unit volumes and lower average selling prices in the eip and utility segments  for the company as a whole  without consideration of delta sales  our fiscal sales unit volumes were approximately lower as compared with on a reportable segment basis  the most significant sales unit volume decrease was in the utility segment  offset somewhat by increased unit sales volumes in the irrigation and coatings segments 
lower unit sales prices and unfavorable sales mix also contributed the lower net sales in  as compared with sales price decreases in  as compared with  resulted from a combination of weaker sales demand and increased price competition in most of our businesses 
the gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in was lower than this decrease in gross profit margins were mainly due to lower gross margins in the utility and eip segments  where we were impacted by a more competitive pricing environment and an unfavorable sales mix 
the impact of these factors on gross profit margins was offset to a degree by lower average raw material costs in  as compared with approximately million 
rising raw material prices also resulted in million in lifo expense in  as compared with a million lifo benefit in on a reportable segment basis  we realized higher lifo expense in the eip million  irrigation million and utility million segments in  as compared with selling  general and administrative sg a spending in fiscal  as compared with  increased due to the following factors expenses associated with the delta acquisition and integration of approximately million 
these expenses were related to investment banking fees  due diligence costs and other direct 
table of contents costs associated with the acquisition and the integration of delta s operations 
these expenses are reported as part of general corporate expense  delta s sg a expenses from may  to december  of million  were included in consolidated sg a expenses 
these increases were somewhat offset by lower employee incentive expenses in  as compared with approximately million  lower sales commissions related to lower net sales in  as compared with approximately million 
in the aggregate  exclusive of the sg a expenses related to delta s operations and its expenses incidental to its acquisition  sg a spending was down approximately million in fiscal  as compared with on a reportable segment basis  the eip and utility segments reported lower operating income and the irrigation and coatings segments reported higher operating income in the fiscal  as compared with the increase in net interest expense in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to interest associated with the million in senior unsecured notes issued in april and approximately million of bank fees incurred in related to providing the required bridge loan funding commitment for the delta acquisition 
other income was lower in fiscal  as compared with  mainly due to lower investment income related to our non qualified deferred compensation plan this year approximately million and foreign currency transaction gains incurred in that did not repeat in the increase in the effective income tax rate in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due to the non deductibility of a portion of the delta acquisition expenses incurred in our cash flows provided by operations were approximately million in  as compared with million in lower net earnings in  as compared with  and the significant decrease in inventories in were the main reasons for the lower operating cash flow in engineered infrastructure products eip segment the increase in net sales in fiscal  as compared with  was mainly due the acquisition of delta s engineered access systems  poles and highway safety products approximately million  offset to a degree by to lower sales volumes and lower sales prices in the lighting and communication structures product lines 
in the lighting traffic and roadway safety product line  we experienced lower sales and average unit selling prices in north american and international markets in  as compared with approximately million 
the decrease in north american sales in  as compared with  was due to weaker customer demand for lighting and traffic poles in the transportation market channel 
sales unit volumes in north america in were slightly lower as compared with we believe sales demand in the transportation market was dampened by the lack of a long term federal highway funding legislation and state budget deficits  as the lack of long term funding legislation does not give the various states ample visibility to implement long term initiatives 
furthermore  highway spending sponsored under the federal program requires the various states to provide part of required funding 
many states are in budget deficits  which may constrain their ability to access federal matching funds to implement roadway projects 
while commercial lighting market sales in were slightly higher as compared with  demand remains relatively weak  due to continued softness in the commercial and residential construction markets 
in europe  sales were lower in  as compared with as most economies in europe are weak  governments have cut spending including for infrastructure projects to cope with budgetary deficits 
the decrease in european lighting sales in  as compared with  was also related to competitive selling price pressures and certain project sales in developing markets in that did not repeat in lighting structure sales in china  while a relatively small portion of global lighting sales  improved in  as compared with  due to increased sales efforts 

table of contents sales in the communication structures product line were lower in fiscal  as compared with  in both north america and china 
in north america  general slowness in the wireless communication structures market and lower sign structure sales resulted in lower sales  as compared with in china  sales of wireless communication structures likewise were lower in  as compared with in  annual supply contracts with the various carriers were settled later than in the past and we believe there is some continuing coordination of the wireless networks in china that is impacting network development at this time 
operating income in the eip segment was higher in fiscal  as compared with  due the impact of the delta infrastructure businesses approximately million  offset somewhat by lower lighting and wireless communication sales volumes and pricing pressures due to weak market conditions 
the impact of lower sales on operating profit was mitigated to an extent by factory operational improvements approximately million 
while lifo expense for the segment was higher in fiscal  as compared with  by approximately million  this impact was largely offset by lower average material costs incurred in  as compared with aside from the impact of the delta acquisition  sg a expenses were approximately million lower in  as compared with  due to various cost containment actions in the segment this year 
utility support structures utility segment in the utility segment  the sales decrease in  as compared with  was due to the combination of lower sales unit volumes in the us and lower average unit selling prices 
the decrease in unit sales in tons in fiscal in the us was approximately  and sales prices were down approximately million from the record sales performance realized in was in part related to the large backlog at the end of the fiscal year  which was the result of substantial order intake in the last half of at the end of fiscal  our sales order backlog was less than half of the year end backlog 
during and continuing into  the economic recession in the us resulted in a drop in electricity demand 
accordingly  our customers reduced their purchases of structures and delayed scheduled projects 
in addition  price competition became more significant  especially in light of falling steel prices throughout most of and generally lower levels of transmission and substation spending this year by utility companies 
we believe that utility companies invested at lower levels due to a combination of some falling electricity consumption in the us during the recession and uncertainty that they would generate an adequate financial return on transmission and substation investments 
in international markets  sales improved over  the result of increased project sales into new markets  offset by lower sales volumes in china 
the decrease in operating income in  as compared with  was a result of lower sales volumes  lower average selling prices and an unfavorable sales mix 
operating profit also was negatively impacted by million in increased lifo expense in  as compared with the decrease in sg a expenses in  as compared with  primarily resulted from lower employee incentives related to the decrease in operating income in approximately million and lower sales commission expense approximately million due to the decrease in net sales in coatings segment net sales in the coatings segment increased in fiscal  as compared with  resulted mainly from the inclusion of delta s galvanizing sales in this segment approximately million and improved sales unit volumes 
galvanizing unit volumes in were approximately higher in as compared with in we attribute the increase in sales demand to slightly stronger industrial economic conditions in our geographic market areas 
the increase in segment operating income in  as compared with  was due to the impact of delta s galvanizing operations approximately million and improved sales volumes and the 
table of contents associated operating leverage 
these effects were offset somewhat by rising zinc costs that were not recovered through sales price increases 
increases in the average cost of zinc in  as compared with  amounted to approximately million 
these cost increases were largely offset by factory efficiencies and increased sales volume 
sg a expenses for the segment in were higher as compared with  mainly due to the impact of delta s galvanizing operations 
irrigation segment irrigation segment net sales in improved  as compared with  due to stronger sales volumes in north america and international markets and currency translation effects on international sales approximately million 
in north america  we believe improved demand for irrigation equipment in over a weak resulted from improvement in grower sentiment and expected net farm income 
in international markets  the sales improvement in over was broad based  as stronger market conditions drove higher sales in most regions 
operating income for the segment improved in over  due to improved sales unit volumes in north america  lower raw material prices net of increased lifo expense of million and a stronger international sales mix 
sg a expenses increased mainly due to increased employee incentives associated with improved operating income approximately million and costs associated with business development activities 
other this unit mainly includes our tubing and industrial and fasteners operations and the delta grinding media and manganese dioxide operations 
the increase in sales and operating income in  as compared with  primarily was due to the delta businesses acquired approximately million and million  respectively and improved sales demand for tubing products 
net corporate expense net corporate expense increased in  as compared with  as expenses included expenses associated with the acquisition of delta approximately million  administrative expenses associated with delta of million including approximately million of pension plan expenses 
these expense increases were offset somewhat by lower employee incentive accruals in of million and other decreases in discretionary spending 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at december   as compared with million at december  the increase in net working capital in mainly resulted from increased inventories to support the increase in sales  especially in the irrigation and utility segments 
operating cash flow was million in fiscal  as compared with million in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flow in mainly was the result of the increase in working capital as compared with  the tax non cash tax benefits recorded as a reduction of income tax expense million and the annual contribution we made to the delta pension plan of million in fiscal in fiscal  this contribution was made before we acquired delta 
investing cash flows capital spending in the fiscal was million  as compared with million in the most significant capital spending projects in included our new plant in 
table of contents india million  certain capacity expansions in the utility segment million and our australian galvanizing operations million  including million to acquire previously leased real property 
we expect our capital spending for the fiscal year to be approximately million 
investing cash flows for fiscal included million of cash less million of cash acquired for the delta acquisition and an aggregate of million associated with increasing our ownership interest in west coast engineering  ltd 
from to and the additional purchase price paid to the former shareholders of stainton related to the performance of the operation after its acquisition in november financing cash flows our total interest bearing debt increased slightly from million at december  to million as of december  in the second quarter of fiscal  we redeemed all of our million of senior subordinated notes that were due in may with the proceeds from the sale of million principal amount of senior unsecured notes 
the senior unsecured notes became part of a series of senior unsecured notes previously issued in april the senior unsecured notes were issued at a premium of million in excess of the principal amount 
we refinanced the senior subordinated notes to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment and to extend our long term debt maturities 
financing cash flows in included approximately million to acquire the remaining of the shares of donhad pty 
ltd 
a manufacturer of steel grinding media serving the australian mining industry 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of invested capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at december  subject to our level of acquisition activity and steel industry operating conditions which could affect the levels of inventory we need to fulfill customer commitments  we plan to maintain this ratio below in our debt financing at december  consisted primarily of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million face value million carrying value of senior unsecured notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in april million face value of notes were issued in april and million face value million of total proceeds of the notes were issued in june we are allowed to repurchase the notes at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks 
we may increase the credit facility by up to an additional million at any time  subject to participating banks increasing the amount of their lending commitments 
the interest rate on our borrowings will be  at our option  either a libor based on a   or month interest period  as selected by us plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda  or  b the higher of the higher of a the prime lending rate and b the federal funds rate plus basis points plus in each case  to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  or 
table of contents libor based on a week interest period plus to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of october  and contains certain financial covenants that may limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
these debt agreements contain covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are as follows interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters  senior interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda over the prior four quarters  and  our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
the key covenant calculations at december  were as follows interest bearing debt ebitda last months leverage ratio senior interest bearing debt ebitda last months senior debt ratio ebitda last months interest expense last months interest earned ratio our businesses are cyclical  but we have diversity in our markets  from a product  customer and a geographical standpoint 
we have demonstrated the ability to effectively manage through business cycles and maintain liquidity 
we have consistently generated operating cash flows in excess of our capital expenditures 
based on our available credit facilities  recent issuance of senior unsecured notes and our history of positive operational cash flows  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
we have not made any provision for us income taxes in our financial statements on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we intend to reinvest those earnings 
of our cash balances at december   million is held in entities outside the united states 
if we need to repatriate foreign cash balances to the united states to meet our cash needs  income taxes would be paid to the extent that those cash repatriations were undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
the income taxes that we would pay if cash were repatriated depends on the amounts to be repatriated and from which country 
if all of our cash outside the united states were to be repatriated to the united states  we estimate that we would pay approximately million in income taxes to repatriate that cash 

table of contents financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  delta pension plan contributions  operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations at december  were as follows in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt interest delta pension plan contributions operating leases unconditional purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations long term debt mainly consisted of million principal amount of senior unsecured notes 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our bank revolving credit agreement 
we also had various other borrowing arrangements aggregating million at december  obligations under these agreements may accelerate in event of non compliance with covenants 
the delta pension plan contributions are related to agreed upon cash funding commitments to the plan with the plan s trustees  which are re negotiated in conjunction with a triennial valuation 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  all of which we plan to use in  and certain capital investments planned for we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
at december   we had approximately million of various long term liabilities related to certain income tax  environmental and other matters 
these items are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
our commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit total commercial commitments the above commitment is a loan guarantee of a non consolidated subsidiary in argentina that is accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the 
table of contents last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply and demand conditions  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years 
our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts on a limited basis to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt at december  was mostly fixed rate debt 
our notes payable and a small portion of our long term debt accrue interest at a variable rate 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have affected our interest expense in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
likewise  we have excess cash balances on deposit in interest bearing accounts in financial institutions 
an increase or decrease in interest rates of ten basis points would have impacted our annual interest earnings in by approximately million 
foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are not material 
from time to time  as market conditions indicate  we will enter into foreign currency contracts to manage the risks associated with anticipated future transactions and current balance sheet positions that are in currencies other than the functional currencies of our operations 
at december   there were no significant open foreign currency contracts 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact our cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our most significant investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions australian dollar chinese renminbi euro uk pound brazilian real commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
at december   we had no open natural gas contracts 

table of contents critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customer s financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impaired ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales which is based on historical claims experience and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time 
our provision for various product warranties was approximately million at december  if our estimate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value approximately of our inventory 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  
table of contents in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in and  we experienced higher costs to produce inventory than in the prior respective years  due mainly to higher cost for steel and steel related products 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income in and of approximately million and million  respectively  than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
in  prices decreased and operating income would have decreased by approximately million than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional inventory write downs may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we identified eleven reporting units for purposes of evaluating goodwill and we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which usually coincides with our strategic planning process 
we assess the value of our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenses discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the projected cash flows 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under current accounting standards  we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
the valuation of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by a substantial margin  except the webforge reporting unit in the engineered infrastructure products segment  which has goodwill of million and an excess of fair value over carrying value of million 
accordingly  no further valuation of our reporting units was necessary 
if our assumptions on discount rates and future cash flows change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe these assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
in the event the discount rate increased by basis points  we would have to further evaluate the webforge reporting unit for possible impairment 
our reporting units are all cyclical and their sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year 
in the evaluation of our reporting units  we look at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names 
we assess the values of these assets apart from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
we use the relief from royalty method to evaluate our trade names  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against estimated future sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and 
table of contents of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be the after tax cost of capital for such assets 
in  impairment charges of million were recorded in connection with our decision to discontinue the use of a trade name for sign structures 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of the pirod and industrial galvanizers of america trade names  by reviewing the valuation assumptions and future business plans associated with the trade name and concluded that the value of the trade names were to be written down by approximately million 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  the valuation allowances decreased significantly 
this was due to the execution of a legal entity restructuring within the delta group which allowed for release of a portion of valuation allowances previously established 
at december   delta had million of deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating losses and million of deferred tax assets associated with its defined benefit pension liability 
because these tax losses were generated in the uk and delta had no operations or future income taxable in the uk  delta historically did not establish a value on its financial statements for these deferred tax assets 
likewise  we concluded that the realization of these deferred tax assets was not more likely than not 
accordingly  we established a valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets of million at fiscal year end in  we formulated and executed a restructuring plan that resulted in us being more likely than not to be able to use some of these deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we removed approximately million of valuation allowances on certain operating loss carryforwards in our delta uk entities  with a corresponding decrease in income tax expense 
at december   million in valuation allowances remain in these entities related to capital loss carryforwards  which are unlikely ever to be realized 
excluding the valuation allowances related to delta  valmont had an increase of million in valuation allowances that increased our income tax expense during in  we reduced our valuation allowances by net million  resulting in a decrease in our income tax expense of approximately million 
this changes occurred because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
in  the most significant decrease in our valuation allowances that affected our income tax expense related to the realization of operating loss carryforwards due to the strong performance of our mexican utility support structures operation 
if circumstances related to our deferred tax assets change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
during we recorded million in income tax expense on million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which we determined are not permanently invested 
foreign subsidiaries not considered permanently invested had total cash of million at december  we have not made any us income tax provision in our financial statements for million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as we intend to reinvest those earnings 
foreign subsidiaries considered permanently invested had total cash of million at december  if circumstances change and we determine that we are not permanently invested  we would need to 
table of contents record an income tax expense on our financial statements for the resulting income tax that would be paid upon repatriation 
the amount of that income tax would depend on how much of those earnings were repatriated but could range from a low of million to a high of million 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period 
pension benefits delta ltd 
maintains a defined benefit pension plan for qualifying employees in the united kingdom 
independent actuaries assist in properly measuring the liabilities and expenses associated with accounting for pension benefits to eligible employees 
in order to use actuarial methods to value the liabilities and expenses  we must make several assumptions 
the critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on pension assets 
we evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually 
key assumptions are based on the following factors discount rate is based on an annualized yield on the iboxx over year aa rated bond index 
expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return  taking into consideration current and expected market conditions 
most of the assets in the pension plan are invested in corporate bonds  the expected return of which are estimated based on risk free bonds gilts in the uk  plus a risk premium of to basis points 
the long term expected returns on equities are based on historic performance over the long term 
inflation is based on the estimated change in the consumer price index cpi or the retail price index rpi  depending on the relevant plan provisions 
the following tables present the key assumptions used to measure pension expense for and the estimated impact on pension expense relative to a change in those assumptions assumptions pension discount rate expected return on plan assets inflation cpi inflation rpi assumptions in millions of dollars increase in pension expense decrease in discount rate decrease in expected return on plan assets increase in inflation item a
