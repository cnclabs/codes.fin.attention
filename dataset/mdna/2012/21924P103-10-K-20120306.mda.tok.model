you should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to important factors including  but not limited to  those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
executive overview strategy we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on commercializing products for the hospital  niche respiratory and related specialty markets 
we are actively seeking to acquire or develop additional products for these markets 
our strategy is to focus our commercial and internal development efforts in the hospital and related specialty product sector within the us pharmaceutical marketplace  acquire companies and marketed and or registration stage products that fit within our focus areas  and market approved generic products through our wholly owned subsidiary  aristos 
we believe this strategy will allow us to improve our revenue growth rate  margins  and profitability and enhance stockholder value 
highlights in  our management concentrated on executing four key initiatives realigning our respiratory sales force to respiratory specialist targets  which we completed in the third quarter  harvesting our allerx pull through revenue through the period permitted under the march fda announcement  
table of contents focusing our existing development pipeline around crtx and crtx  and evaluating and executing upon strategic alternatives for our anti infective products  which is still on going 
in addition to the above initiatives  we directed our business development efforts on identifying products and companies that meet our strategic acquisition criteria 
these efforts resulted in acquiring all of the outstanding shares of cardiokine on december  and its pending nda for lixivaptan to be used  if approved  to treat hyponatremia crtx 
if approved  crtx will be marketed and sold by our hospital sales force 
the following summarizes certain key financial results for the year ended december  cash and cash equivalents increased million or to million as of december  from million as of december   net product sales from strategic products increased million to million in from million in  representing year over year growth 
the percentage of net product sales generated from strategic products increased to in from in  exceeding our strategic plan target of 
overall net product sales were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income from operations decreased million  or  to a loss of million in from income from operations of million in on a gaap basis  and decreased million  or  to million in from million in on a non gaap basis  and net income decreased million  or  to a loss of  in from net income of million in on a gaap basis  and decreased million  or  to million in from million in on a non gaap basis 
in march  the fda announced that it intended to initiate enforcement action against marketed unapproved prescription cough  cold and allergy products manufactured on or after june  or shipped on or after august  we expected this action  and all of our marketed unapproved products had already been manufactured and shipped prior to december  however  as a result of the march fda announcement  in august our distribution partners began returning substantial amounts of products that were in the distribution channel 
because we have historically derived significant revenues and income from these products  our net product sales  gross margin and income from operations have declined in when compared to going forward  we anticipate replacing these revenues and income with increased revenues from our branded products  particularly curosurf  zyflo cr and any products we acquire  and  if approved  our product candidates crtx  a generic product  and crtx  a branded product 
opportunities and trends we continue to execute on our strategic plan  which calls for promoting our curosurf and zyflo franchises and transitioning away from our primary care focused anti infective franchise 
also  we are sharpening our focus on the hospital  niche respiratory and related specialty markets 
in addition  we will continue our business development efforts to expand our product portfolio 
finally  we will continue to progress both crtx and crtx through the regulatory approval process 
we believe these actions  combined with the experience and expertise of our management team  position us well to drive the future growth of our revenue and income 
we generate revenue by promoting our products to targeted health care professionals who are hospital based or whose practices focus on the treatment of respiratory disorders 
primarily  these health care professionals are specialists 
in  we realigned our sales force to focus calls on neonatologists and respiratory specialists 
as a result  our share of the hospital market for our lead product  curosurf  has continued to grow  and the percentage of our respiratory products prescribed by specialists continues to increase 
we have also focused our development pipeline to concentrate on projects that may enhance the life cycle of our zyflo products 
as we continue to focus on the growth of our existing products and product candidates  we also continue to position ourselves to execute acquisitions that will drive our next phase of growth 
we are systematically 
table of contents focusing our efforts on acquiring products or companies whose products will fit strategically with the focus and strengths of our sales force 
we believe that we can continue to operate efficiently in challenging economic and industry environments and that we will find opportunities to invest our cash in ways that will drive future growth 
we will need to continue to maintain our strategic focus  manage and deploy our available cash efficiently and strengthen our alliance and partner relationships in order to execute our strategy successfully 
in we will focus on the following five key initiatives growing revenues from our existing product portfolio  evaluating and executing upon strategic alternatives for our anti infective products  gaining regulatory approval and launching crtx  advancing our product pipeline  in particular crtx  and acquiring specialty products and or companies

table of contents net revenues net product sales 
curosurf net product sales increased million  or  during compared to primarily due to an increase in price  partially offset by an increase in the estimated fees to be paid to our distributors 
zyflo cr and zyflo net product sales were relatively flat during compared to excluding the impact of an additional reserve of million recorded in to account for an increase in actual returns compared to management s initial estimate at the time of the merger  net product sales decreased approximately million  or  during this decrease was primarily due to lower unit volume and increases in government rebates and the estimated fees to be paid to our distributors  partially offset by a price increase 
factive net product sales increased million  or  during compared to excluding the impact of additional reserves of million recorded in to account for an increase in our estimated rate of future returns  net product sales decreased approximately  or  during this decrease was primarily due to relatively flat unit volume along with increased voucher redemption as a result of additional promotional efforts for our anti infective products  partially offset by a price increase 
spectracef net product sales increased million  or  during compared to excluding the impact of an additional reserve of million for potential returns of discontinued product and increases in our estimated rates for product returns on net product sales during  net product sales increased approximately  or  during this increase was primarily due to increases in unit volume as a result of additional promotional efforts for our anti infective products  increases in price and a reduction in medicaid rebates  partially offset by increased voucher redemption 
allerx dose pack net product sales decreased million  or  during compared to deferred revenue related to the sales was recognized in as revenue when prescriptions were filled 
the decrease in product sales was primarily due to the march fda announcement  which caused a decline in prescriptions 
in addition  we received approximately million in returns related to product for which revenue had been deferred 
as of december    remains in deferred revenue 
hyomax net product sales decreased million  or  during compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower net prices and lower unit volume as a result of increased competition from other manufacturers 
during  revenue has been recognized as prescriptions were filled instead of our historic practice of recognizing revenue at the time of sale 
this change was due to our inability to estimate product returns as a result of changes in market dynamics  large amounts of channel inventory and extended payment terms offered on certain sales 
as of december    remains in deferred revenue 
net product sales from other products decreased million  or  during compared to primarily due to our november withdrawal from the market of our propoxyphene acetaminophen products 
net product sales for propoxyphene acetaminophen products during were million  whereas we had no product sales from propoxyphene acetaminophen products during during  we also recorded returns in excess of our original estimates related to our propoxyphene acetaminophen products resulting in an additional million decrease in net product sales 
license and royalty agreement revenues 
license and royalty agreement revenues decreased million  or  during compared to primarily due to the one time  upfront nonrefundable payment of million we received in august in accordance with our license agreement with targacept  inc  or targacept  under which we out licensed certain rights with respect to our alpha receptor technology 
costs and expenses cost of product sales 
cost of product sales exclusive of amortization of product rights of million and million in and  respectively decreased million  or during compared to cost of product sales consists primarily of standard costs for each of our commercial products  distribution costs  royalties and inventory allowances 

table of contents gross profit exclusive of license and royalty agreement revenues and amortization of product rights was as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  change net product sales cost of product sales exclusive of amortization of product rights gross profit gross margin based on our current product mix  we expect that gross margin will continue to decline primarily because our lead product  curosurf  has a lower gross margin than our other products 
unless we are able to commercialize or acquire products with similar gross margins to the marketed unapproved products that we previously sold and the anti infective products that we are deemphasizing  our gross margins will not return to historic levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during compared to this decrease was primarily due to decrease in labor and benefits related costs as a result of the realignment of our respiratory sales force  decrease in co promotion expenses from the withdrawal of our propoxyphene acetaminophen products  decreased sample usage for zyflo cr  and decreased advertising and promotional expenses 
these decreases were partially offset by higher stock based compensation  regulatory fees and marketed product support during research and development expenses 
we designate development projects to which we have allocated or plan to allocate significant research and development resources with the term crtx and a unique number 
costs related to discontinued products and product candidates that are in the early stages of development are included in other projects

as a result  we ceased work on our allergy product candidates as well as our cough cold product candidates  crtx  crtx and crtx our product development expenses for particular product candidates will continue to vary significantly from year to year depending on the product development stage and the nature and extent of the activities undertaken to advance the product candidate s development in a given year 
we expect to continue to incur significant development expenses as we seek to advance the development and fda approval of our product candidates and seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical testing 
amortization of product rights 
amortization of product rights increased million  or  during compared to during  we focused our product development projects to align with our strategic direction 
this decision resulted in the write off of million of capitalized product rights that no longer align with our strategic direction 

table of contents benefit from provision for income taxes the benefit from income taxes was  during  compared to a provision for million in our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to is due primarily to the fact that we recorded a benefit associated with our pre tax book loss for the period as well as an additional tax benefit associated with the release of a portion of the valuation allowance

table of contents net revenues net product sales 
curosurf net product sales increased million  or  during compared to this increase was primarily due to the fact that we acquired the curosurf product rights from chiesi during the third quarter of and began promoting and selling curosurf in september accordingly  our net product sales for curosurf reflect a full year of marketing  promoting and selling the curosurf products  as opposed to a partial year in zyflo cr and zyflo net product sales increased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to the increase in our price and the steady prescription volume  which were partially offset by additional expense recorded for actual product returns related to sales made prior to the merger 
factive net product sales increased million  or  during compared to this increase was primarily due to the fact that we acquired the factive product rights and related inventory from oscient on september  we began earning revenues from factive in september  however  we did not begin marketing and promoting factive until october accordingly  our net product sales for factive reflect a full year of marketing  promoting and selling the factive products  as opposed to a partial year in this increase in net product sales was partially offset by an increase in our estimated rate of product returns as a result of lower demand than expected and an increase in returns over our initial estimate at the acquisition date as well as an increase in rebates expected to be paid as a result of promotional activities 
spectracef net product sales decreased million  or  during compared to  primarily due to lower sales volumes caused by some dilution of our sales promotion efforts as a result of the introduction of factive into our product portfolio

allerx dose pack net product sales decreased million  or  during compared to the decrease in product sales was primarily due to the deferral of revenue from sales made during and to additional expense recorded for an increase in actual returns of certain allerx products sold prior to at december   approximately million of revenue from sales of allerx was deferred due to the inability to estimate returns 
as a result of changes in market dynamics  large amounts of channel inventory and extended payment terms offered on certain sales  we were unable to estimate returns due to uncertainty regarding consumer demand and the level of competition 
deferred revenue related to these sales was recognized as revenue when prescriptions were filled 
hyomax net product sales decreased million  or  during compared to this decrease was primarily due to lower net prices and lower volume as a result of increased competition from other manufacturers as well as deferral of revenue from sales made during december at december   approximately million of revenue from sales of hyomax products was deferred due to the inability to estimate returns 
as a result of large amounts of channel inventory and extended payment terms offered on certain sales  we were unable to estimate returns 
deferred revenue related to these sales was recognized as revenue when prescriptions were filled

table of contents amortization of product rights 
amortization of product rights increased million  or  during compared to this increase was primarily due to the curosurf and factive product rights 
we added curosurf and factive to our product portfolio during the third quarter of provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million during  compared to million in our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the impact of the release of valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets during as well as changes in the estimated income tax provision related to the year ended december  the majority of the impact from changes in the estimated income tax provision related to a change in estimate regarding utilization of net operating losses resulting from additional analysis that we performed related to the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that can be used under the rules governing ownership changes in section of the internal revenue code 
we performed an in depth analysis during the year that resulted in a larger amount of net operating loss carryforward to be available to offset taxable income for the tax year 
upon release of the valuation allowances  we fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards that were not subject to limitations  thereby reducing total income tax expense in and significantly lowering our effective tax rate 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to supplement the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with gaap  we use non gaap measures of certain components of financial performance 
these non gaap measures include non gaap operating income  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
our management regularly uses supplemental non gaap financial measures to understand  manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions 
these non gaap measures are among the primary factors management uses in planning for and forecasting future periods 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with  or an alternative to  measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from similarly titled non gaap measures used by other companies 
in addition  these non gaap measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles 
the additional non gaap financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  the financial information presented in accordance with gaap such as operating income loss  net income loss and earnings loss per share and should not be considered measures of our liquidity 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the non gaap financial measures reflect adjustments for stock based compensation expense  amortization of product rights and transaction related expenses 
transaction related expenses consist of costs incurred to complete product or company acquisitions or other strategic transactions  including due diligence and legal  consulting and other related fees  integration costs related to our completed transactions  and transaction related fees associated with transactions that are not consummated 
we exclude these expenses from our non gaap measures because we believe that their exclusion provides an additional means to assess the extent to which our efforts and execution of our strategy are reflected in our operating results 
in particular  stock based compensation expense is excluded primarily because it is a non cash expense that is determined based on subjective assumptions  product rights amortization is excluded because it is not reflective of the cash settled expenses incurred related to product sales  and transaction related expenses are excluded because management believes they have no direct correlation to current operating results 
our management believes that these non gaap measures  when shown in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures  enhance investors and management s overall understanding of our current financial performance and our prospects for the future 
the non gaap measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not reflect all of the expenses associated with the results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap and the exclusion of these expenses involved the exercise of judgment by management 
even though we have excluded stock based compensation expense  amortization of product rights and transaction related expenses from the non gaap 
table of contents financial measures  stock based compensation is an integral part of our compensation structure  the acquisition of product rights is an important part of our business strategy and the transaction related expenses  whether or not the transaction is successfully closed  may be significant cash expenses

table of contents funding requirements our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level of product sales and product returns of our currently marketed products and any additional products that we may market in the future  the scope  progress  results and costs of development activities for our current product candidates  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  additional product candidates that we pursue  the extent to which we acquire or invest in products  businesses and technologies  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the costs and timing of establishing manufacturing and supply arrangements for clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and products  the extent to which we are required to make certain contingent payments in connection with our acquisition of cardiokine  the extent to which we choose to establish collaboration  co promotion  distribution or other similar arrangements for our marketed products and product candidates  and the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining  enforcing and defending claims related to intellectual property owned by or licensed to us 
to the extent that our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements or other financing alternatives 
we have no committed external sources of funds 
additional equity or debt financing  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
based on our current operating plans  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated revenues from product sales are sufficient to continue to fund our existing level of operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent contractual liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment  including contingencies related to potential future development  financing  contingent royalty payments and or scientific  regulatory or commercial milestone payments under development agreements 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations operating leases include minimum payments under leases for our facilities  automobiles and certain equipment

we have excluded these potential liabilities and milestone payments from the contractual obligations table because we are unable to precisely predict the timing or ultimate cash settlement amounts of these payments 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for more information regarding the potential payments related to our acquisition of cardiokine and milestone payments related to our licensing  distribution and development agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
we expect our cost of product sales and other operating expenses will change in the future in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our property and equipment  we believe that the incremental inflation related to the replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
while our management generally believes that we will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting our product prices and implementing operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and other financial information 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a description of our significant accounting policies and method used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
net product sales product sales 
we recognize revenue from our product sales upon transfer of title  which occurs when product is received by our customers 
we sell our products primarily to large national wholesalers  which have the right to return the products they purchase 
we estimate the amount of future returns at the time of revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales net of estimated allowances for product returns  rebates  price adjustments  chargebacks  and prompt payment and other discounts 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future product returns  we record revenues when the risk of product return has been substantially eliminated 
as of december   we had million of deferred revenue related to sales for which future returns could not be reasonably estimated at the time of sale 
deferred revenue is recorded net of estimated allowances for rebates  price adjustments  chargebacks  and prompt payment and other discounts 
the deferred revenue is recognized when the product is sold through to the end user based upon prescriptions filled 
to estimate product sold through to end users  we rely on third party information  including prescription data and information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers 
when we implement a price increase  we generally offer our existing customers an opportunity to purchase a limited quantity of product at the previous list price 
shipments resulting from these programs generally are not materially in excess of ordinary levels  therefore  we recognize the related revenue when the product is received by the customers and include the shipments in estimating our various product related allowances 
in the event we determine that these shipments represent purchases of inventory in excess of ordinary levels for a given wholesaler  the potential impact on product returns exposure is specifically evaluated and reflected as a reduction in revenue at the time of such shipments 
product returns 
consistent with industry practice  we offer contractual return rights that allow our customers to return the majority of our products within an month period that begins six months prior to and ends twelve months subsequent to expiration of the products 
our products have an to month expiration period from the date of manufacture 
in determining our return allowance  we consider various relevant factors  including actual and historical return rates for expired lots 
our historical return rates for expired lots vary by product and approximate  on a product by product basis  our current return rates 
historical and forecasted product sales and consumer consumption data reported by external information management companies 
management reviews sales forecasts and consumption data on a product by product basis to assist it in estimating whether product is expected to become short dated and thus subject to return 
estimated expiration dates or remaining shelf life of inventory in the distribution channel 
our products generally have remaining shelf lives of between to months at time of shipment 
levels of inventory in the distribution channel and any significant changes to these levels 
levels of inventory in the distribution channel typically range from six to eight weeks of product demand 
competitive issues such as new product entrants and other known changes in sales trends 
based on the above factors  management determines an estimated return rate for each product and applies that rate to the quantity of units sold that is subject to future return 
as of december   our estimated return rates for products currently subject to return ranged from to depending on the product 

table of contents we routinely assess our experience with product returns and adjust our reserves accordingly 
the amount of actual product returns could be either higher or lower than the amounts we have accrued 
changes in our returns estimates are charged to income in the period in which the information that gives rise to the change becomes known 
if our estimates of returns differ from our actual results  there could be a material impact on our financial statements 
based on historical experience  our average actual return rates vary based on our product mix 
we consider a one percentage point variation to be a reasonably possible change in the percentage of our product returns to related gross sales on a product by product basis 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in each of the individual products estimated product returns rate would have had an approximate million  or  effect on our net revenues recognized in expense recognized for product returns was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
expense recognized during for product returns related to current year sales was million  or of gross product sales 
expense recognized during for product returns related to sales made in prior years was million  or of gross product sales 
the additional expense of million consisted primarily of million related to our propoxyphene acetaminophen products and million related to allerx dose pack products 
the additional expense recorded in for our propoxyphene acetaminophen products related to actual returns in excess of our original estimates established in november when these products were voluntarily withdrawn from the market in response to the fda s actions requiring the withdrawal of the branded versions of propoxyphene 
the additional expense recorded in for allerx related to an increase in actual returns due to a continued decline in prescription demand influenced by the march fda announcement 
even though the majority of our sales of allerx were deferred due to our inability to estimate returns  the market decline has impacted the level of returns of products sold prior to december rebates 
the liability for government program rebates is calculated based on historical and current rebate redemption and utilization rates contractually submitted by each program s administrator 
expense recognized for rebates was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
price adjustments and chargebacks 
our estimates of price adjustments and chargebacks are based on our estimated mix of sales to various third party payers  which are entitled either contractually or statutorily to discounts from the listed prices of our products 
these estimates are also based on the contract fees we pay to certain group purchasing organizations  or gpos  in connection with our sales of curosurf 
we make these estimates based on the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with gaap 
in the event that the sales mix to third party payers or the contract fees paid to gpos are different from our estimates  we may be required to pay higher or lower total price adjustments and or chargebacks than we have estimated 
from time to time  we offer certain promotional incentives to our customers for our products  and we expect that we will continue this practice in the future 
these programs include sample cards to retail consumers  certain product incentives to pharmacy customers and other sales stocking allowances 
we estimate our liability for each promotional program and record the liabilities as price adjustments 
we estimate our liability for these voucher programs based on the historical redemption rates for similar completed programs used by other pharmaceutical companies as reported to us by a third party claims processing organization and actual redemption rates for our completed programs 
expense recognized for price adjustments and chargebacks was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately  and of gross product sales in  and  respectively 
the increase in the expense as a percentage of gross product sales during was primarily due to increased redemption of vouchers for our anti infective products 
there were no current period adjustments during related to prior period provisions for price adjustments and chargebacks 
we do not expect future changes in our estimates for price adjustments and chargebacks to be material 

table of contents prompt payment discounts 
we typically require our customers to remit payments within the first to days  depending on the customer and the products purchased 
in addition  we offer wholesale distributors a prompt payment discount if they make payments within these deadlines 
this discount is generally  but may be higher in some instances due to product launches or customer and or industry expectations 
because our wholesale distributors typically take the prompt payment discount  we accrue of the prompt payment discounts  based on the gross amount of each invoice  at the time of our original sale to them  and we apply earned discounts at the time of payment 
we adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
historically  these adjustments have not been material 
we do not anticipate that future changes to our estimates of prompt payment discounts will have a material impact on our net revenue 
expense recognized for prompt payment discounts was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing approximately of gross product sales in each year
