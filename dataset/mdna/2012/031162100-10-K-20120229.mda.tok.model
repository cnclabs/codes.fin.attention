on august   we announced a plan to restructure our worldwide operations in order to improve our cost structure 
under this plan in  and  we incurred restructuring charges of million million  net of tax  million million  net of tax and million million  net of tax  respectively  related primarily to staff separation costs  asset impairment charges  accelerated depreciation primarily in and loss accruals for leases on certain facilities that will not be used in our business 
as part of the accounting for the business combinations of alantos pharmaceutical holding  inc and ilypsa  inc 
in  under the then existing accounting rules we recorded charges to write off acquired in process r d ipr d of million and million  respectively 
the charges represent the estimated fair values of the ipr d that  as of the respective acquisition dates  had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in  we recorded a million legal settlement charge million  net of tax in connection with an agreement in principle to settle allegations relating to our sales and marketing practices 
in  we recorded loss accruals for settlements of certain commercial legal proceedings aggregating million  related principally to the settlement of the ortho biotech products lp ortho biotech antitrust suit 

table of contents effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash 
as required by this standard  we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt 
under this method of accounting  the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
the equity components of our convertible notes are included in common stock and additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification  as applicable 
the reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non cash interest expense 
this results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms 
included in net income for    and is the incremental non cash interest expense of million million  net of tax  million million  net of tax  million million  net of tax  million million  net of tax and million million  net of tax  respectively  related to the adoption of the new accounting standard

overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen s business 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our results of operations discussed in md a are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
we are the world s largest independent biotechnology medicines company 
we discover  develop  manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses 
we concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care  inflammation and nephrology 
our principal products include neulasta  neupogen  enbrel  aranesp and epogen 
for additional information about our products  their approved indications and where they are marketed  see item business marketed products 
in  we had several notable accomplishments  including achieving record us and international product sales of billion and billion  respectively 
we also paid our first ever dividends  aggregating million paid in in december  we declared a quarterly dividend of per share of common stock payable in march  representing a increase over prior quarters 
additionally  in  we repurchased approximately of our stock outstanding as of december   for a total cost of billion 
of this amount  billion was purchased in a modified dutch auction tender offer following an increase in our authorized stock repurchase program to billion and our announcement that we intended to accelerate our repurchases  reflecting our confidence in the long term value of the company and the attractive interest rate environment 
we issued billion of debt  in part to fund the purchase of stock related to the tender offer 
we expect to repurchase the remaining billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open market purchases 
we enter with various opportunities to continue growing our business 
we believe the currently approved indications for xgeva and prolia represent significant commercial opportunities 
in addition  receiving regulatory and or reimbursement approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications 
table of contents for these products may provide further opportunities for growth 
longer term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and japan  by the successful development of our later stage pipeline and through strategic business development opportunities  such as our acquisitions of biovex  bergamo and our recently announced agreement to acquire micromet 
our continued focus on increasing cost efficiencies  along with the significant savings that we will realize upon the expiration of our enbrel co promotion agreement with pfizer in the fourth quarter of  may assist in providing the necessary resources to fund many of these future opportunities 
our business will  however  continue to face various challenges 
certain of our products will continue to face increasing competitive pressure  including in europe as a result of biosimilars 
in the united states  enbrel will also continue to face increasing competition and our esas may begin facing competition in the near term 
additionally  over the next several years  many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire and  as a result  we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars 
we also believe our products and product candidates will continue to face regulatory and reimbursement challenges 
in addition  the current global economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business  including increased pressure to reduce healthcare expenditures 
certain of the above challenges may have a material adverse impact on our sales  results of operations and liquidity 
however  these effects may be offset by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business  as discussed above 
selected financial information the following provides an overview of our results of operations as well as our financial condition amounts in millions  except percentages and per share data change product sales us international total product sales other revenues total revenues operating expenses operating income net income diluted eps diluted shares when discussing changes in product sales below  any reference to unit growth or decline refers to changes in the purchases of our products by healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals and pharmacies 
the increase in us product sales for reflects overall growth for all marketed products except esas  which declined 
excluding sales of esas  us product sales increased  driven primarily by unit growth and  to a lesser extent  increases in average net sales prices 
international product sales for were negatively impacted by a decline in sales of aranesp of 
excluding aranesp sales  international product sales grew 
the decrease in other revenues for was due principally to certain milestone payments earned in the increase in operating expenses for was driven primarily by a legal settlement charge and higher sg a expenses 
the decrease in diluted eps for was due to the reduction in net income  attributable primarily to lower operating income 
this decrease in diluted eps was offset partially by the favorable impact of our stock repurchase program  which reduced the number of shares used to compute diluted eps 

table of contents although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales  the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts  both positive and negative  that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure  primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the euro 
our results of operations for were impacted by the puerto rico excise tax 
commencing january   puerto rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in puerto rico 
this tax is currently scheduled to expire in we account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold 
for us income tax purposes  the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred 
this excise tax has had and will continue to have a significant adverse impact on our cost of sales and a significant favorable impact on our provision for income taxes 
in addition  the overall impact of the excise tax will vary from period to period as a result of the timing difference between recognizing the expense and the applicable foreign tax credit 
as a result of the excise tax  for cost of sales increased by million  the provision for income taxes was reduced by million and eps was favorably impacted by 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion  and total debt outstanding was billion 
of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december   approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the united states 
under current tax laws  if these funds were repatriated for use in our us operations  we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect 
results of operations product sales worldwide product sales were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change neulasta neupogen enbrel aranesp epogen other products total product sales total us total international total product sales product sales are influenced by a number of factors  some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others  including  but not necessarily limited to our contracting and pricing strategies  recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  legislative reform in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions  
table of contents cost containment pressures  and the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers  clinical trial outcomes  including adverse events or results from clinical trials  including sub analyses  studies or meta analyses performed by us or by others including our licensees or independent investigators  which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior  use of our products  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices  competitive products  including biosimilars  physician and patient compliance with product dosing regimens  changes in clinical practice  including those resulting from the development of new protocols  tests and or treatments  adoption of and adherence to risk management activities  such as a rems  undertaken by us or required by the fda or other regulatory authorities  product label changes  patient population growth  segment growth and penetration  new product launches and indications  expansion into new international markets  patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adequacy of product supply and distribution  effectiveness of our marketing efforts  including those conducted under collaboration agreements  concentration of customer purchasing power  and acquisitions and divestures 
our us product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year  including wholesaler and end user buying patterns eg  holiday driven wholesaler and end user stocking  contract driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles 
such factors can result in higher demand for our products and or higher wholesaler inventory levels and  therefore  higher product sales for a given three month period  generally followed by a reduction in demand and or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three month period 
for example  sales of certain of our products in the united states for the three months ended march have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three month period  which we believe to be due  in part  to certain of these factors 
while this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis  these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended march with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year 
in addition  general economic conditions may affect  or in some cases amplify  certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales

cost of sales increased to of product sales for  driven primarily by higher bulk material costs and higher inventory write offs due to voluntary epogen  procrit epoetin alfa and enbrel recalls 
these increases were offset partially by lower excess capacity charges and lower royalties  primarily for enbrel 
research and development r d costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily salaries  benefits and other staff related costs  facilities and overhead costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services and other outside costs  information systems costs and amortization of acquired technology used in r d with alternative future uses 
r d expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with k a and third party r d arrangements  including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use 
net payment or reimbursement of r d costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery 
the company groups all of its r d activities and related expenditures into three categories discovery research and translational sciences  later stage clinical programs and marketed products 
these categories include the company s r d activities as set forth in the following table category description discovery research and translational sciences r d expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase clinical trials 
these activities encompass our discovery research and translational sciences functions  including drug discovery  toxicology  pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism  and process development

marketed products r d expenses incurred in support of the company s marketed products that are authorized to be sold in the united states or the eu 
includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained  as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the united states or the eu has been obtained 

table of contents r d expense by category was as follows in millions discovery research and translational sciences later stage clinical programs marketed products total r d expense 
the increase in r d expense for was driven primarily by an increase of million in our marketed product support largely driven by our continued support for prolia and xgeva which  subsequent to their approvals during  were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs  and an increase of million in our later stage clinical program support  including amg  ganitumab amg  talimogene laherparepvec and amg  offset partially by decreased support for prolia and xgeva as a result of their aforementioned approvals 
these increases were offset partially by a decrease of million in our discovery research and translational sciences activities  due primarily to reduced amortization expense related to r d technology intangible assets acquired in business combinations in prior years 
the increase in r d expense for was driven primarily by an increase of million in our marketed product support largely driven by our support for prolia and xgeva which  subsequent to their approvals during  were categorized as marketed products rather than later stage clinical programs and  to a lesser extent  lower cost recoveries from ongoing collaborations 
this increase was offset by a reduction of million in our later stage clinical programs as a result of the aforementioned approvals of prolia and xgeva  as well as licensing fees paid in  and lower expenses associated with our discovery research and translational sciences activities of million 
certain amounts for have been reclassified to better conform to the above descriptions of r d activities

the increase in interest and other income  net  for was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments of million and higher interest income of million  due principally to higher average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 
income taxes the decrease in our effective tax rate for was due primarily to the foreign tax credits associated with the puerto rico excise tax described below offset partially by the effect of the non deductible us healthcare reform federal excise fee in  the non deductible portion of the legal settlement reached in principle in and the favorable resolution in of certain prior years non routine transfer pricing matters with tax authorities 
commencing january   puerto rico imposes a temporary excise tax on the acquisition of goods and services from a related manufacturer in puerto rico 
the excise tax is imposed over a six year period beginning in with the excise tax rate declining in each year in  in  in  in  in  and in 
we account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold 
for us income tax purposes  the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes in the year in which the excise tax is incurred 
the effective tax rate for would have been approximately without the impact of the tax credits associated with the puerto rico excise tax 

table of contents the increase in our effective tax rate for was due primarily to the incremental favorable impact resulting from the resolution of certain prior years matters with tax authorities in compared to  the unfavorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix in  and the tax impact from adjustments to deferred taxes arising from changes in california tax law enacted in and effective for subsequent periods 
the resolution of prior years tax matters recognized in and reduced the effective tax rate by and  respectively

see summary of critical accounting policies income taxes and note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  a new accounting standard was issued that changed the disclosure requirements for the presentation of other comprehensive income oci in the financial statements  including the elimination of the option to present oci in the statement of stockholders equity 
oci and its components will be required to be presented for both interim and annual periods either in a single financial statement  the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive financial statements  consisting of a statement of income followed by a separate statement presenting oci 
this standard is required to be applied retrospectively beginning january   except for certain provisions for which adoption was delayed 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources selected financial data was as follows as of december  and in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities total assets current portion of long term debt long term debt stockholders equity the company intends to continue to return capital to stockholders through share repurchases and the payment of cash dividends  reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business 
the amount we spend  the number of shares repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will vary based on a number of factors  including the stock price  the availability of financing on acceptable terms  the amount and timing of dividend payments and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares  and the manner of purchases may include private block purchases  tender offers  as well as market transactions 
whether and when we declare dividends or repurchase stock  the size of any dividend and the amount of stock we repurchase could be affected by a number of additional factors 
see item a 
risk factors there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock 
in april  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional billion of our common stock 
subsequently in october  the board of directors increased the total authorization for stock repurchases by billion to billion 
at that time  we announced our intent to accelerate our stock repurchase program  reflecting our confidence in the long term value of the company and the attractive interest rate environment 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of billion  including billion purchased in a modified dutch auction tender offer 
we expect to repurchase the remaining billion of stock under our authorized stock repurchase program through open market purchases 
in april  the board of directors also approved a dividend policy related to our common stock and subsequently declared quarterly cash dividends of per share of common stock in july and october  resulting in dividend payments aggregating million in additionally in december  the board of directors declared a increase in our quarterly cash dividend to per share of common stock  payable in march 
table of contents we believe existing funds  cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock  and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue  including acquisitions and licensing activities  in each case for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources  including cash provided by operating activities  sales of marketable securities  borrowings through commercial paper and or our syndicated credit facility and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets 
with respect to our us operations  we believe that existing funds intended for use in the united states  cash generated from our us operations  including intercompany payments and receipts  and existing sources of and access to financing collectively referred to as us funds are adequate to continue to meet our us obligations including our plans to repurchase stock and pay dividends with us funds for the foreseeable future 
see item a 
risk factors current economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business 
a significant portion of our operating cash flows is dependent upon the timing of payments from our customers located in the united states and  to a lesser extent  customers outside the united states  which include government owned or supported healthcare providers government healthcare providers 
payments from these government healthcare providers are dependent  in part  upon the economic stability and creditworthiness of their applicable country 
deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of southern europe  particularly in spain  italy  greece and portugal  may continue to increase the average length of time it takes to collect payments  particularly in certain regions within these countries 
however  the timing of payments from government healthcare providers has not nor is it expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating cash flows 
to date we have not incurred any significant losses on collections of trade receivables from these government healthcare providers 
over the next several years  many of the existing patents on our principal products will expire 
as a result  we expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars that may have a material adverse impact on our product sales  results of operations and liquidity 
upon patent expiration for small molecule products  there is typically intense competition from generics manufacturers  which generally leads to significant and rapid declines in sales of the branded product 
given that our principal products are biologics  we do not believe the impact of biosimilar competition will be as significant as with small molecule products  in part because successful competitors must have a broad range of specialized skills and capabilities unique to biologics  including significant regulatory  clinical and manufacturing expertise  and since the products are similar  but not identical  the biosimilars will have to compete against a product with an established efficacy and safety record 
as discussed above  we have many opportunities to grow our business  including the continued commercialization of xgeva and prolia and expansion into emerging markets and japan  which we believe may offset the adverse financial impact of our principal products patent expiries 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances as of december   approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the united states 
under current tax laws  if these funds were repatriated for use in our us operations  we would be required to pay additional income taxes at the tax rates then in effect 
the primary objective of our investment portfolio is to enhance overall returns in an efficient manner while maintaining safety of principal  prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk 
our investment policy limits debt security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer 
financing arrangements the current and noncurrent portions of our long term borrowings at december   were million and billion  respectively 
the current and noncurrent portions of our long term borrowings at december   were billion and billion  respectively

under the terms of these contracts  we receive interest payments in pounds sterling at a fixed rate of on million and pay interest in us dollars at a fixed rate of on million  the aggregate notional amounts paid to received from the counterparties upon exchange of currencies at the inception of these contracts 
we will pay us dollars to and receive pounds sterling from the counterparties at the maturity of the contracts for the same notional amounts 
the terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged notes  effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on these notes from pounds sterling to us dollars 
as of december   we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working capital needs 
at december  and  we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 
in december  we entered into a billion syndicated  unsecured  revolving credit agreement which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program 
the commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to million with the agreement of the banks 
each bank which is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years 
this term may be extended for up to two additional one year periods with the agreement of the banks 
annual commitment fees for this agreement are based on our current credit rating 
we would be charged interest at libor plus for any amounts borrowed under this facility 
as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this facility 
in connection with the new revolving credit agreement we terminated our prior billion revolving credit agreement that was scheduled to expire in november in march  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to replace an existing shelf registration statement that was scheduled to expire in april this shelf registration statement allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  warrants to purchase debt securities  common stock  preferred stock or depository shares  rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock  securities purchase contracts  securities purchase units  and depository shares 
under this shelf registration statement  all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
this shelf registration statement expires in march 
table of contents in  we established a million medium term note program under which medium term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
as of december  and  no securities were outstanding under this medium term note program 
certain of our financing arrangements contain non financial covenants 
in addition  our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant with respect to the level of our borrowings in relation to our equity  as defined 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of december  see note  financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financing arrangements 
cash flows our cash flow activity was as follows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities operating cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds 
cash provided by operating activities decreased during the due primarily to increased interest payments  working capital increases related to the launch of prolia and xgeva  and the prepayment of certain royalties 
the reduction in net income during was driven primarily by the accrual of the legal settlement charge of million  which will be paid in a subsequent period 
cash provided by operating activities during decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities 
investing capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in  and were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in puerto rico and other site developments 
we currently estimate spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately million 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   also included the cost of acquiring certain businesses totaling million 
net proceeds from marketable securities were million for  compared to net purchases of marketable securities of billion for and billion for financing cash used in financing activities during was due to the repurchases of our common stock of billion  including billion purchased in a modified dutch auction tender offer in december  repayment of long term debt of billion  and payment of dividends of million  offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long term debt of billion  including billion issued in november and december  in part  to finance the repurchase of our common stock in the modified dutch auction tender offer 
cash used in financing activities during was due to the repurchases of our common stock of billion  offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long term debt of billion 
cash used in financing activities during was due to repurchases of our common stock of billion and repayment of long term debt of billion  offset partially by the net proceeds from issuance of long term debt of billion 

table of contents see note  financing arrangements  and note  stockholders equity  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 
the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions payments due by period year years years years contractual obligations total and and and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the long term debt obligation amounts also include future interest payments 
future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating libor based coupon over the life of the respective note 
we used an interest rate forward curve at december   in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts which resulted in an aggregate net reduction in future interest payments of million 
see note  financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest swap contracts 
in order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our pound sterling denominated long term debt issued in december  we entered into cross currency swap contracts that effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment on this debt from pounds sterling to us dollars 
for purposes of this table  we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest and principal payments and on this debt 
see note  financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our cross currency swap contracts 
the long term debt obligations amounts include the repayment of principal on our euro denominated foreign currency debt at the foreign currency exchange rates in effect at december  see note  financing arrangements  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long term debt obligations 
purchase obligations relate primarily to i our long term supply agreements with third party manufacturers  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity  ii r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  iii capital expenditures  and iv open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 

table of contents liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits utbs net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately million at december   are not included in the table above because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
in addition to amounts in the table above  we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts  which in the aggregate are significant  upon the achievement of various development  regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties  including contingent consideration incurred with the acquisition of biovex 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events  substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring 
these contingent payments have not been included in the table above  and  except with respect to the fair value of the biovex contingent consideration  are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is approximately billion  including million in connection with the acquisition of biovex see note  business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales deductions and returns revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  cash discounts and other deductions collectively  sales deductions and returns  which are established at the time of sale 
we analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly 
amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results 
amounts recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for sales deductions were as follows in millions rebates chargebacks other deductions total balance as of january  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  for the years ended december   and  total sales deductions were  and of gross product sales  respectively 
included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior year sales due to changes in estimates 
such amounts represent or less of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for the three year ended december  
table of contents in the united states  we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals and pharmacies 
products we sell in the eu are distributed principally to hospitals and or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties  and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns 
accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales deductions are substantially product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the united states  including those paid to state medicaid programs  and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product  by payer and individual payer plans 
we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold  contractual terms  historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded 
we adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience 
estimating such rebates is complicated  in part  due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability  which for certain rebates can take up to one year and greater than one year for certain recent government programs 
rebates totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for each of the three years ended december  a change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million  or approximately one half of of our product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between amgen and the healthcare providers 
the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers 
those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers  and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks 
product returns returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product  when appropriate 
historically  sales return provisions have been insignificant  amounting to less than of gross product sales 
furthermore  changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes based on pretax income  applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 

table of contents we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
the amount of utbs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances  such as significant amendments to existing tax law  new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties  where appropriate  related to utbs in income tax expense 
certain items are included in the company s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements 
such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities are either i a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or ii an expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return  but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements 
the company is a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
the company is subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdictions where it conducts activities based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions  risks and activities performed therein 
the company s pre tax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions 
for example  the company conducts significant operations outside the united states in puerto rico pertaining to manufacturing  distribution and other related functions to meet its worldwide product demand 
income from the company s operations in puerto rico is subject to a tax incentive grant that expires in our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
substantially all of this benefit is attributable to the company s foreign income associated with the company s operations conducted in puerto rico 
if future events  including material changes in cash  working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results 
our operations are subject to the tax laws  regulations and administrative practices of the united states  us state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business 
significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
see item a 
risk factors the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings and other matters such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  governmental investigations and class action suits which are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in note  contingencies and commitments  to the consolidated financial statements 
we record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items  an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with business combinations we have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations 
these intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and ipr d product candidates 
discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in a business combination 
these models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date  projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies for product candidates  estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in process projects  and developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows 
significant estimates and assumptions are also required to determine the acquisition date fair values of any contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations 
in addition  we must revalue these obligations each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved and record changes in their fair values in earnings 
the acquisition date fair values of the various contingent consideration obligations incurred in the acquisition of biovex see note  business combinations  to the consolidated financial statements were determined using a combination of valuation techniques 
significant estimates and assumptions required for these valuations included  but were not limited to  the probability of achieving regulatory milestones  product sales projections under various scenarios and discount rates used to calculate the present value of the required payments 
these estimates and assumptions are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligations each reporting period 
accordingly  subsequent changes in underlying facts and circumstances could result in changes in these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the estimated future fair values of these obligations 
we believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired and contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with business combinations are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business 
to reduce certain of these risks  we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program 
we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes 
in the capital and credit markets  strong demand for fixed income instruments led to historically low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during short term interest rates on us treasury instruments continued to decline due to a combination of the federal reserve s monetary policies and the challenging macroeconomic environment 
as a result  in the discussion that follows  we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points from those at december  and continued uncertainty surrounding european sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets  and we have consequently assumed a hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of december  and interest rate sensitive financial instruments our portfolio of available for sale debt security investments at december  and  was comprised of us treasury securities and other government related debt securities  corporate debt securities  mortgage and 
table of contents asset backed securities  money market mutual funds  and additionally at december   other short term interest bearing securities  composed principally of commercial paper 
the fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a basis point change in interest rates 
applying a duration model  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates 
in addition  a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and  would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
as of december   we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
as of december   we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
our outstanding debt at december  and  was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt 
changes in interest rates would  however  affect the fair values of fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at december   would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at december   would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date 
the analysis for the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap and cross currency swap contracts 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swap contracts  which qualify and have been designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges  for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling billion at december  and these derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating rate libor based coupon over the life of the respective note 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  and  would have resulted in a reduction fair value of approximately million on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
the analysis for the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest rate sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
as of december   we had open cross currency swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that hedge the entire principal amount of our pound sterling denominated debt and related interest payments 
these contracts effectively convert payments on this debt to us dollars and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges 
a hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates at december   would have resulted in approximately a million reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contracts on this date but would not have a material effect on cash flows or income in the ensuing year 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro 
increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses 
increases and decreases in our foreign currency denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign currency denominated liabilities 
to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations  we enter into foreign currency forward  option and cross currency swap contracts 
as of december   we had outstanding debt with a carrying value and fair value of billion that was denominated in pounds sterling and euros 
a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have 
table of contents resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately million on this date with a corresponding reduction in income in the ensuing year and would not result in a material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year 
the analysis for this debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign exchange would have on the related cross currency swap contracts 
with regard to our cross currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our pound sterling denominated debt  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in the fair value of these contracts of approximately million on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related cash flows in the ensuing year 
the impact on income in the ensuing year of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates  which would equal the entire change in the carrying amount of the hedged debt  would be approximately million 
we enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december   we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
as of december   we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
as of december  and  the net unrealized gains on these contracts were not material 
with regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately million on this date and  in the ensuing year  a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately million 
with regard to contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately million on this date and  in the ensuing year  a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately million 
the analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
as of december  and  we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million  respectively  that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at december  and with regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair value of these contracts on this date and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
with regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december   would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts on these dates of approximately million and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the ensuing year 
the analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
market price sensitive financial instruments as of december  and  we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments  which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of december  and  was not material 
counterparty credit risks our financial instruments  including derivatives  are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement 
our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by 
table of contents requiring transactions to be with institutions with investment grade credit ratings and requires placing exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty 
in addition  we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer
