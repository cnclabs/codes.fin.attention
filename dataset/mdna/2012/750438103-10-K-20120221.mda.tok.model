executive overview radioshack is a leading national retailer of innovative mobile technology products and services  as well as products related to personal and home technology and power supply needs 
we offer a targeted assortment of wireless phones and other electronic products and services from leading national brands  exclusive private brands and major wireless carriers 
our more than  locations in the us and mexico give us a unique competitive advantage in scale  reach and convenience 
we seek to differentiate ourselves from our various competitors by providing innovative mobile technology products and services  as well as products related to personal and home technology and power supply needs  at competitive prices convenient neighborhood locations knowledgeable  objective and friendly service unique private brand offers and exclusive branded promotions our day to day focus is concentrated on providing our customers with a positive in store experience growing gross profit dollars controlling costs throughout the organization utilizing funds generated from operations to enhance long term shareholder value external factors affecting our business in  we continued to experience a highly challenging us economic environment and reduced consumer spending that began in the fourth quarter of consumer spending on wireless handsets has increased significantly over the past several years 
the spending growth for wireless handsets has been primarily driven by increased purchases of smartphones such as apple s iphone and android based devices 
a smartphone is a wireless handset that offers more advanced computing ability  connectivity to the internet  and multimedia capabilities than a basic feature wireless phone 
smartphones typically combine wireless handset capabilities with capabilities previously found on separate devices 
some examples include gps global positioning system navigation  digital music players and camera capabilities 
we believe this convergence of capabilities into smartphones has contributed to a decline in these product categories 
this convergence trend is likely to continue as smartphones evolve and as more consumers adopt smartphone technology 
according to the consumer electronics association cea  in the consumer electronics industry will surpass billion in overall revenues in the us for the first time 
the industry is expected to grow percent in  after reaching an estimated billion in revenues in smartphones are expected to continue to be the primary revenue driver for the industry 
smartphone unit sales are expected to increase percent in to million units  with total revenue exceeding billion 
the innovation in certain mature consumer electronic product categories  such as dvd players  camcorders and audio products  has not been sufficient to maintain average selling prices 
these mature products have become commoditized  and we continue to experience price declines and reduced margins for them 
business performance was a year of progress and transitions for our business 
during  we successfully completed several initiatives added wireless offerings from verizon wireless to our portfolio of top national wireless carriers successfully completed the rollout of our target mobile centers to  target stores throughout the us closed our chinese manufacturing plant to transition to a more efficient global sourcing operation doubled our annual dividend to per share to increase value returned to shareholders maintained our liquidity by entering into a new million credit facility that expires in january enhanced our balance sheet by selling million of year senior notes during  our mobility business  which includes postpaid and prepaid wireless handsets  commissions and residual income  prepaid wireless airtime  e readers  and tablet devices  increased from of our net sales and operating revenues in to in this and other factors discussed later in this md a had an effect on the decrease of our gross margin rate in during  our business experienced a transition to a lower gross margin rate 
this decrease in gross margin rate has been driven primarily by a transition towards lower margin products as discussed later in this md a 
t mobile to verizon transition in  we notified t mobile that it had breached its agreement with us through which we offered t mobile wireless products and services in our us company operated stores 
we ceased offering t mobile wireless products and services in our us company operated stores on september   and began offering verizon products and services in our us company operated stores on september  in conjunction with this transition  we recognized a million inventory valuation loss with respect to t mobile wireless handsets we had on hand at june   which was classified as additional cost of products sold 
furthermore  in conjunction with this transition  we incurred an additional charge to earnings of million in the third quarter of relating to a payment to t mobile 
we continue to sell t mobile wireless products and services in certain target mobile centers 
our sales of verizon products and services in our us company operated stores from september   through december   outperformed the sale of t mobile products and services in those stores during the same period last year  and we view this as a growth opportunity for us in target mobile centers by december   we had successfully completed our rollout of target mobile centers in  target stores 
closure of chinese manufacturing plant we ceased production operations in our chinese manufacturing plant during the second quarter of since production operations ceased  we have continued to acquire inventory similar to that previously produced by this facility from alternative product sourcing channels 
in conjunction with the plant closing  we incurred total costs of million in we incurred million in compensation expense for severance packages for the termination of approximately  employees 
we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of million related to the reversal of our foreign currency cumulative translation adjustment  which is classified as a selling  general and administrative expense 
the remaining million relates to an inventory valuation loss  accelerated depreciation  and other general and administrative costs 
substantially all of these costs were incurred in the second quarter of future costs to manage the liquidation  which are not expected to be significant  will be expensed as incurred and will include compensation expense such as retention bonuses for the remaining employees  rent expense  and professional fees 
discontinued operations all of our remaining kiosks located in sam s club stores were transitioned to sam s club by june  we determined that the cash flows from these kiosks were eliminated from our ongoing operations 
therefore  these operations were reclassified from the kiosks segment to discontinued operations in the second quarter 
the operating results of these kiosks are presented in the consolidated statements of income as discontinued operations  net of income taxes  for all periods presented 
we incurred no significant gain or loss in connection with the transition of these kiosks to sam s club 
we redeployed substantially all of our sam s club kiosk employees to nearby radioshack stores or target mobile centers  and we redistributed our sam s club kiosk inventory to our remaining retail channels 
results of operations summary net sales and operating revenues increased million  or  to  million when compared with last year 
comparable store sales decreased 
the increase in our net sales and operating revenues was driven primarily by sales at the target mobile centers that were open on december   but not on december  the increase in sales that was driven by our additional target mobile centers was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales 
the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily driven by sales decreases in our consumer electronics and signature platforms  which were partially offset by an increase in our mobility platform sales 
gross margin decreased by percentage points from last year to 
this decrease was primarily driven by a change in our sales mix within our mobility platform towards lower margin smartphones and tablets  combined with the overall growth of our mobility platform through our target mobile centers and us radioshack company operated stores 
smartphones generally  and the apple iphone in particular  carry a lower gross margin rate  given their higher average cost basis 
revenue from smartphones as a percentage of our mobility platform in was percentage points higher than in additionally  our gross margin rate was negatively affected by more promotional pricing in the fourth quarter of when compared with the same period in we expect this change in our sales mix to continue to affect our gross margin rate in primarily because of customer migration to smartphones  the effect of sprint and verizon offering the iphone for all of compared with less than full years in  and the effect of our recently opened target mobile centers being open for a full year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense increased million when compared with last year 
this increase was primarily driven by increased costs to support our target mobile centers of million  a one time charge of million  or of net sales and operating revenues  related to our transition from t mobile to verizon  and million in costs related to the closure of our chinese manufacturing plant

following their closure as sprint branded kiosks in august  certain former sprint branded kiosk locations became multiple wireless carrier radioshack branded locations 
at december   we managed and reported of these locations as extensions of existing radioshack company operated stores located in the same shopping malls

these sales increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our t mobile postpaid wireless business and decreased sales in our sprint postpaid wireless business 
the decreased sales in our sprint postpaid wireless business were due to changes in sprint s customer and credit models  which resulted in fewer new and upgrade activations in the last three quarters of sales in our signature platform which includes wireless  music  computer  video game  and home entertainment accessories  general purpose and special purpose power products  technical products  and services decreased in this sales decrease was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital to analog television converter boxes and related television antennas  music accessories  and media storage  but was partially offset by increased sales of headphones and tablet accessories 
sales in our consumer electronics platform which includes digital music players  personal computing products  laptop computers  cameras  residential telephones  digital televisions  and other consumer electronics products decreased in this sales decrease was driven by sales declines in substantially all of the categories in this platform  but was primarily driven by decreased sales of digital music players  digital cameras and camcorders  and gps devices

compared with wireless service provider settlement agreement the business terms of our relationships with our wireless service providers are governed by our wireless reseller agreements 
these contracts are complex and include provisions determining our upfront commission revenue  net of chargebacks for wireless service deactivations  our acquisition and return of wireless handsets  and  in some cases  future residual revenue  performance targets and marketing development funds 
disputes occasionally arise between the parties regarding the interpretation of these contract provisions 
certain disputes arose with one of the company s wireless service providers pertaining to upfront commission revenue for activations prior to july   and related chargebacks for wireless service deactivations 
negotiations regarding resolution of these disputes culminated in the signing of a settlement agreement in july in connection with the decision to settle these disputes  the company considered the following the timing of cash outflows and inflows in connection with the disputed upfront commission revenue and related chargebacks  and the estimated future residual revenue  the benefits of settling the disputes and agreeing to enter into good faith negotiations with the wireless service provider in the third quarter of to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement  and the risks associated with the ultimate realization of the estimated future residual revenue

the wireless service provider agreed to pay million to the company on or before july  the company and the wireless service provider agreed to enter into good faith negotiations in the third quarter of to modify the commission and chargeback provisions of our wireless reseller agreement 
beginning july   the wireless service provider was no longer obligated to pay future residual revenue amounts to the company for a period of time for customers activated on or before june  for the first six months of  these residual revenue amounts averaged approximately million per quarter 
based on this average  we would receive no residual revenue payments from this wireless service provider for eight quarters beginning with the third quarter of under the terms of the settlement agreement

the decrease in net income plus non cash adjustments was primarily driven by decreased net income 
cash used in working capital components was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in cash used in working capital components in was primarily driven by a larger accounts payable balance 
our accounts payable balance was larger at december   than it was at december   because of differences in the timing of invoice receipts and related payments in compared with investing activities cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures of million in were consistent with the million we spent in capital expenditures primarily related to information system projects  target mobile centers  and our us radioshack company operated stores

free cash flow our free cash flow  defined as cash flows from operating activities less dividends paid and additions to property  plant and equipment  was million in  million in  and million in the increase in free cash flow for was attributable to increased cash flow from operating activities as described above 
we believe free cash flow is a relevant indicator of our ability to repay maturing debt  change dividend payments or fund other uses of capital that management believes will enhance shareholder value 
the comparable financial measure to free cash flow under generally accepted accounting principles is cash flows from operating activities  which was million in  million in  and million in we do not intend for the presentation of free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with gaap  nor do we intend to imply that free cash flow represents cash flow available for discretionary expenditures 
the following table is a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow 
year ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities less additions to property  plant and equipment dividends paid free cash flow sources of liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared with million in we believe that our cash flows from operations and available cash and cash equivalents will adequately fund our operations  our capital expenditures  and our maturing debt obligations 
additionally  we had a credit facility of million with availability of million as of december  the table below lists our credit commitments from various financial institutions at december  in millions commitment expiration per period credit commitments total amounts committed less than year years years over years lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments available financing on january   we terminated our million credit facility and entered into the credit facility

this facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s inventory  accounts receivable  cash and cash equivalents  and certain other personal property  and is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries 
borrowings under the credit facility are subject to a borrowing base of certain collateralized assets and bear interest at a bank s prime rate plus to or libor plus to 
the applicable rates in these ranges are based on the aggregate average availability under the facility 
the credit facility also contains a million sub limit for the issuance of standby and commercial letters of credit 
the issuance of letters of credit reduces the amount available under the facility 
letter of credit fees are to for standby letters of credit and to for commercial letters of credit

as of december   no borrowings had been made under the facility  and letters of credit totaling million had been issued 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  restrict certain payments  including dividends and share repurchases 
also  if we do not meet a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio during a trailing twelve month period  the availability under our credit facility will be reduced by the greater of of the borrowing base or million 
we currently anticipate that we will be in compliance with the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio during we are generally free to pay dividends and repurchase shares as long as the current and projected unused amount under the facility is greater than of the maximum borrowing amount and the minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio is maintained 
we may pay dividends and repurchase shares without regard to the company s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as long as the current and projected unused amount under the facility is greater than of the maximum borrowing amount and cash on hand is used for the dividends or share repurchases 
cash requirements capital expenditures we anticipate that our capital expenditure requirements for will range from million to million

the base level of capital expenditures required to support our operations ranges from million to million 
the remaining amount of anticipated capital expenditures relates to strategic initiatives as reflected in our annual plan 
these capital expenditures are discretionary and  therefore  may not be spent if we decide not to pursue one or more of our strategic initiatives 
us radioshack company operated store remodels and relocations and information systems projects will account for the majority of our anticipated capital expenditures 
cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operating activities will be used to fund future capital expenditure needs 
seasonal inventory buildup typically  our annual cash requirements for pre seasonal inventory buildup from august to november range between million and million 
the funding required for this buildup comes primarily from cash on hand and cash generated from net sales and operating revenues 
additionally  our credit facility could be utilized to fund the inventory buildup

notes on may   we sold million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due may  in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers exempt from registration pursuant to rule a and regulation s promulgated under the securities act of  as amended such notes  together with any notes issued in the exchange offer we subsequently registered with the sec for such notes the exchange offer  being referred to as the notes 
in september  substantially all of the privately placed notes were exchanged for notes in an equal principal amount that we issued pursuant to the exchange offer 
accordingly  the exchange resulted in the issuance of substantially all of the notes in a transaction registered with the sec  but it did not result in the incurrence of any additional debt 
the obligation to pay principal and interest on the notes is jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by all of the guarantors under the credit facility 
on the issue date  the notes were guaranteed by all of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries except tandy life insurance company 
the notes pay interest at a fixed rate of per year 
interest is payable semiannually  in arrears  on may and november the notes were sold to the initial purchasers at a discount of million for aggregate consideration of million and resulted in net proceeds to the company of million after the payment of million in issuance costs 
the effective annualized interest rate of the notes after giving effect to the original issuance discount is the notes and the guarantees are the company s and the guarantors general unsecured senior obligations and  therefore  will be subordinated to all of the company s and the guarantors existing and future secured debt to the extent of the assets securing that debt 
in addition  the notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the liabilities of our subsidiaries that are not guaranteeing the notes  to the extent of the assets of those subsidiaries 
the notes contain covenants that could  in certain circumstances  limit our ability to issue additional debt  repurchase shares of our common stock  make certain other restricted payments  make investments  or enter into certain other transactions 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
convertible notes in august  we sold the convertible notes in a private offering 
each  of principal of the convertible notes was initially convertible  under certain circumstances  into shares of our common stock or a total of approximately million shares  which is the equivalent of per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set forth under terms of the convertible notes 
upon conversion  we would pay the holder the cash value of the applicable number of shares of our common stock  up to the principal amount of the note 
amounts in excess of the principal amount  if any  the excess conversion value may be paid in cash or in stock  at our option 
holders may convert their convertible notes into common stock on the net settlement basis described above at any time from may   until the close of business on july   or if  and only if  one of the following conditions has been met during any calendar quarter  and only during such calendar quarter  in which the closing price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price per share of common stock in effect on the last day of such preceding calendar quarter during the five consecutive business days immediately after any consecutive trading day period in which the average trading price per  principal amount of convertible notes was less than of the product of the closing price of the common stock on such date and the conversion rate on such date we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or specified corporate transactions occur the convertible notes were not convertible at the holders option at any time during or in  we paid an annual dividend of per share 
this was a per share increase as compared to the annual dividend we paid at the time we issued the convertible notes 
this dividend increase triggered an anti dilutive provision relating to the convertible notes that changed the conversion rate of the notes convertible note anti dilutive provision 
as a result  at december   each  of principal of the convertible notes was convertible  under the circumstances previously discussed  into shares of our common stock  which is the equivalent of per share 
accordingly  conversion of all of the convertible notes would result in the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
holders who convert their convertible notes in connection with a change in control may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate 
in addition  upon a change in control  liquidation  dissolution or delisting  the holders of the convertible notes may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their convertible notes for of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
as of december   none of the conditions allowing holders of the convertible notes to convert or requiring us to repurchase the convertible notes had been met 
concurrent with the issuance of the convertible notes  we entered into note hedge transactions with citigroup and bank of america whereby we have the option to purchase up to million originally million shares of our common stock at a price of per share originally per share the convertible note hedges  and we sold warrants to the same financial institutions whereby they have the option to purchase up to million shares originally million shares of our common stock at a per share price of originally the warrants 
the convertible note hedges and warrants were structured to reduce the potential future share dilution associated with the conversion of the convertible notes 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are separate contracts with the two financial institutions  are not part of the terms of the convertible notes  and do not affect the rights of holders under the convertible notes 
a holder of the convertible notes does not have any rights with respect to the convertible note hedges or warrants

the annual cash dividend of per share for was paid on december   to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  the dividend payment of million was funded from cash on hand 
the company expects dividends will be paid on a quarterly basis beginning in the first quarter of and will be funded from cash on hand and operating cash flows 
share repurchases in october  our board of directors approved an authorization for a total share repurchase of million of the company s common stock to be executed through open market or private transactions 
during the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million shares or million of our common stock under this program 
we announced on january   that we have suspended further share repurchases under this program 
during the second quarter of  we paid million to purchase million shares of our common stock in open market purchases under our share repurchase program 
these purchases completed our million share repurchase authorization 
the declaration of dividends  the dividend rate  and the amount and timing of share repurchases are at the sole discretion of our board of directors  and plans for future dividends and share repurchases may be revised by the board of directors at any time 
radioshack s dividend and share repurchase programs could be affected by  among other things  changes in radioshack s results of operations  capital expenditures  cash flows  and applicable tax laws 
off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases described above  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  transactions  or special purpose entities 
inflation inflation has not significantly affected us over the past three years 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant effect on our operations in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
the application of gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout our financial statements and is affected by management s judgment and uncertainties 
our estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience  current market trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant and reasonable at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
we continually evaluate the information used to make these estimates as our business and the economic environment change 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical are revenue recognition  inventory valuation  estimation of reserves and valuation allowances specifically related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies  valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  and stock based compensation 
we consider an accounting policy or estimate to be critical if it requires difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and is material to the portrayal of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the selection  application and disclosure of our critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed by the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition description our revenue is derived principally from the sale of name brand and private brand products and services to consumers 
revenue is recognized  net of an estimate for customer refunds and product returns  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products  such as wireless telephone handsets  require the customer to use the services of a third party service provider 
the third party service provider pays us an upfront commission for obtaining a new customer or upgrading an existing customer and  in some cases  a monthly recurring residual amount based upon the ongoing arrangement between the service provider and the customer 
our sale of an activated wireless telephone handset is the single event required to meet the delivery criterion for both the upfront commission and the recurring residual revenue 
upfront commission revenue  net of estimated wireless service deactivations  is generally recognized at the time an activated wireless telephone handset is sold to the customer at the point of sale 
recurring residual revenue is recognized as earned under the terms of each contract with the service provider  which is typically as the service provider bills its customer  generally on a monthly basis 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our revenue recognition accounting methodology requires us to make certain judgments regarding the estimate of future sales returns and wireless service deactivations 
our estimates for product refunds and returns  wireless service deactivations and commission revenue adjustments are based on historical information pertaining to these items 
based on our extensive history in selling activated wireless telephone handsets  we have been able to establish reliable estimates for wireless service deactivations 
however  our estimates for wireless service deactivations can be affected by certain characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers 
these factors include changes in the quality of their customer service  the quality and performance of their networks  their rate plan offerings  their policies regarding extensions of customer credit  and their wireless telephone handset product offerings 
these factors add uncertainty to our estimates 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate sales returns or wireless service deactivations during the past three fiscal years 
we continue to update our estimate for wireless service deactivations to reflect the most recently available information regarding the characteristics of and decisions made by our service providers discussed above 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to these or various other factors  the amount of revenue recorded could be materially affected 
a difference in our reserves for the estimates noted above would have affected net sales and operating revenues by approximately million in inventory valuation description our inventory consists primarily of finished goods available for sale at our retail locations or within our distribution centers and is recorded at the lower of average cost which approximates fifo or market 
the cost components recorded within inventory are the vendor invoice cost and certain allocated freight  distribution  warehousing and other costs relating to merchandise acquisition required to bring the merchandise from the vendor to the location where it is offered for sale 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate typically  the market value of our inventory is higher than its aggregate cost 
determination of the market value may be very complex and  therefore  requires a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  current selling prices  seasonality factors  consumer trends  competitive pricing  performance of similar products or accessories  planned promotional incentives  technological obsolescence  and estimated costs to sell or dispose of merchandise such as sales commissions 
if the estimated market value  calculated as the amount we expect to realize  net of estimated selling costs  from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory  is determined to be less than the recorded cost  we record a provision to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item to its net realizable value 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to estimate our inventory valuation reserves 
differences between management estimates and actual performance and pricing of our merchandise could result in inventory valuations that differ from the amount recorded at the financial statement date and could also cause fluctuations in the amount of recorded cost of products sold 
if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate or changes in consumer demand affect certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to material losses or gains in excess of our established valuation reserve 
we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for our inventory valuation reserves 
however  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves 
estimation of reserves and valuation allowances for self insurance  income taxes  and litigation contingencies description the amount of liability we record for claims related to insurance  tax and legal contingencies requires us to make judgments about the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we are insured for certain losses related to workers compensation  property and other liability claims  with deductibles up to million per occurrence 
this insurance coverage limits our exposure for any catastrophic claims that result in liability in excess of the deductible 
we also have a self insured health program administered by a third party covering the majority of our employees that participate in our health insurance programs 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for all insurance programs discussed above at the end of each reporting period 
this estimate is based on historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other factors we deem relevant 
we are subject to periodic audits from multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities related to income tax  sales and use tax  personal property tax  and other forms of taxation 
these audits examine our tax positions  timing of income and deductions  and allocation procedures across multiple jurisdictions 
our accounting for tax estimates and contingencies requires us to evaluate tax issues and establish reserves in our consolidated financial statements based on our estimate of current probable tax exposures 
depending on the nature of the tax issue  we could be subject to audit over several years  therefore  our estimated reserve balances might exist for multiple years before an issue is resolved by the taxing authority 
we are involved in legal proceedings and governmental inquiries associated with employment and other matters 
our accounting for legal contingencies requires us to estimate the probable losses in these matters 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with in house and outside legal counsel and is based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our liabilities for insurance  tax and legal contingencies contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with these items 
we use our history and experience  as well as other specific circumstances surrounding these claims  in evaluating the amount of liability we should record 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our various claims and revise our estimates as appropriate 
these revisions could materially affect our results of operations and financial position or liquidity 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate our insurance  tax  or legal contingencies reserves during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions for these items 
however  a change in our insurance reserves at december   would have affected net income by approximately million 
as of december   actual losses had not exceeded our estimates 
additionally  for claims that exceed our deductible amount  we record a gross liability and corresponding receivable representing expected recoveries  since we are not legally relieved of our obligation to the claimant 
although we believe that our insurance  tax and legal reserves are based on reasonable judgments and estimates  actual results could differ  which may expose us to material gains or losses in future periods 
these actual results could materially affect our effective tax rate  earnings  deferred tax balances and cash flows in the period of resolution 
valuation of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill description long lived assets  such as property and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  such as insufficient cash flows or plans to dispose of or sell long lived assets before the end of their previously estimated useful lives 
the carrying amount is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value 
we estimate fair value based on projected future discounted cash flows 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs 
the carrying value of the asset is adjusted to the new carrying value  and any subsequent increases in fair value are not recorded 
additionally  if it is determined that the estimated remaining useful life of the asset should be decreased  the periodic depreciation expense is adjusted based on the new existing carrying value of the asset and the new remaining useful life 
our policy is to evaluate long lived assets for impairment at a store level for retail operations 
we have acquired goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets related to business acquisitions 
the original valuation of these intangible assets is based on estimates of future profitability  cash flows and other judgmental factors 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we review our goodwill and other intangible asset balances on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset might exceed their fair value 
if the carrying amount of an intangible asset or a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we recognize an impairment loss for this difference 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate our impairment loss calculations for long lived assets contain uncertainties because they require us to apply judgment and estimates concerning future cash flows  strategic plans  useful lives and assumptions about market performance 
we also apply judgment in the selection of a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in our current business model 
our impairment loss calculations for intangible assets and goodwill contain uncertainties because they require us to estimate fair values related to these assets 
we estimate fair values based on various valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows and other comparable market analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require us to make judgments and assumptions regarding future profitability  industry factors  planned strategic initiatives  discount rates and other factors 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies we use to assess impairment loss for long lived assets  intangible assets  or goodwill during the past three fiscal years  and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use in calculating these impairment losses 
however  if actual results or performance of certain business units are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  we may be exposed to additional impairment charges  which could be material to our results of operations 
the total value of our goodwill and intangible assets at december   was million 
of this amount  million related to goodwill from the purchase of radioshack de mexico 
based on our most recent review of goodwill impairment  we noted that the fair values of our reporting units were substantially greater than their carrying values 
stock based compensation description we have historically granted certain stock based awards to employees and directors in the form of non qualified stock options  incentive stock options  restricted stock and deferred stock units 
see note summary of significant accounting policies and note stock based incentive plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
at the date an award is granted  we determine the fair value of the award and recognize the compensation expense over the requisite service period  which typically is the period over which the award vests 
the restricted stock and deferred stock units are valued at the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options with only service conditions is estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock options with service and market conditions is valued utilizing a lattice model with monte carlo simulations 
judgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate the black scholes merton and lattice models require management to apply judgment and use subjective assumptions  including expected option life  volatility of stock prices  and employee forfeiture rate 
we use historical data and judgment to estimate the expected option life and employee forfeiture rate  and use historical and implied volatility when estimating the stock price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodologies used to record stock based compensation during the past three years 
while the assumptions that we develop are based on our best expectations  they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions and employee behavior that are outside of our control 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
additionally  if actual employee forfeitures significantly differ from our estimated forfeitures  we may have an adjustment to our financial statements in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense in would have affected our net income by approximately million 
factors that may affect future results matters discussed in our md a and in other parts of this annual report on form k include forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws  including section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the exchange act 
these forward looking statements are statements that are not historical and may be identified by the use of words such as expect  believe  anticipate  estimate  intend  potential or similar words 
these matters include statements concerning management s plans and objectives relating to our operations or economic performance and related assumptions 
we specifically disclaim any duty to update any of the information set forth in this report  including any forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are made based on management s current expectations and beliefs concerning future events and  therefore  involve a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties  including the risk factors described in item a  risk factors  of this annual report on form k 
management cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees  and our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we held no derivative instruments that materially increased our exposure to market risks for interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices or other market price risks 
our exposure to interest rate risk results from changes in short term interest rates 
interest rate risk exists with respect to our cash equivalents of million at december  these instruments currently yield less than basis points on an annualized basis 
a hypothetical decrease of interest rates to zero would result in a decrease in annual interest income of less than million 
this hypothesis assumes no change in the cash equivalent balance 
we have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our purchase of inventory from manufacturers located in china and other areas outside of the us our purchases are denominated in us dollars  however  the strengthening of the chinese currency  or other currencies  against the us dollar could cause our vendors to increase the prices of items we purchase from them 
it is not possible to estimate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate changes on our purchases of this inventory 
we are also exposed to foreign currency fluctuations related to our mexican subsidiary  which accounted for less than of consolidated net sales and operating revenues
