our resellers are not given rights to 
table of contents return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs 
we generally recognize product revenue from our reseller and end user customers at the time of shipment  provided other revenue recognition criteria are met 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied 
see revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
field sales 
we have trained our field sales organization to support and develop leads for our resellers and to establish and maintain key accounts and strategic end user customers 
to support these objectives  our field sales force assists end user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems  differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings  continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers  promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers  and assists our resellers to drive to closure business opportunities

long lived assets see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for more information regarding our long lived assets 
marketing we continue to develop and execute on a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products by communicating the value of our solutions to our existing and potential customers  our distribution channels and our resellers 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows  conferences and seminars  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  frequent updates to our publicly available website  promotions  web based training courses  advertising and public relations 
we also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation 
backlog 
table of contents our product backlog at june   the last day of our fiscal year  net of anticipated back end rebates for distributor sales  was approximately million  compared with product backlog of approximately million at july   the last day of our fiscal year 
our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity 
our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead time orders and delivery schedules 
actual shipments depend on the then current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors 
although the company believes that the orders included in the backlog are firm  all orders are subject to possible rescheduling by customers  cancellations by customers which the company may elect to allow without penalty to customer  and further pricing adjustments on orders from distributors 
therefore  the company does not believe that its backlog  as of any particular date is necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any future period 
seasonality like many of our competitors  we historically have experienced seasonal fluctuations in customer spending patterns  which generally adversely affect our first and third fiscal quarters 
this pattern should not be relied upon  however  as it has varied in the past 
customer service and support our customers seek high reliability and maximum uptime for their networks 
to that extent  we provide the following service offerings support services for end users  resellers and distributors 
we meet the service requirements of our customers and channel partners through our technical assistance centers  or tacs  located in utrecht  netherlands  research triangle park  north carolina  and chennai  india 
our tac engineers and technicians assist in diagnosing and troubleshooting technical issues regarding customer networks 
development engineers work with the tacs to resolve product functionality issues specific to each customer 
professional services 
we provide consultative services to improve customer productivity in all phases of the network lifecycle planning  design  implementation  operations and optimization management 
our network architects develop and execute customized hardware deployment plans to meet individualized network strategies 
these activities may include the management and coordination of the design and network configuration  resource planning  staging  logistics  migration and deployment 
we also provide customized training and operational best practices manuals to assist customers in the transition and sustenance of their networks 
education 
our classes cover a wide range of topics such as installation  configuration  operation  management and optimization providing customers with the necessary knowledge and experience to successfully deploy and manage our products in various networking environments 
classes may be scheduled and available at numerous locations worldwide 
we deliver training using our staff  on line training classes and authorized training partners 
in addition  we make much of our training materials accessible free of charge on our internet site for customers and partners to use in self education 
we believe this approach enhances the market s ability to learn and understand the broad array of advantages of our products 
manufacturing we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations as part of our strategy to maintain global manufacturing capabilities and to reduce our costs 
we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and test development at our main campus in santa clara  california 
this approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and to flexibly respond to changes in market demand 
our end to end supply chain  including our three engineering facilities at santa clara  rtp  and chennai  india  are all iso certified 
we use alpha networks  inc headquartered in hsinchu  taiwan to design and build some of our products 
alpha networks is a global networking original design manufacturer odm leader with core competencies in areas such as ethernet  lan man  wireless  broadband and voip 
alpha networks  inc s manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
our wireless products are supplied under an original equipment manufacturer oem supply agreement with symbol technologies  inc  a subsidiary of motorola  inc motorola 
motorola rebrands and customizes the wireless products for us to resell to customers 
motorola s manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
motorola has made ongoing supply and support commitments during the term of the agreement and is required to provide support for a defined period of time after any termination of the agreement 
these manufacturers utilize automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn in with specified tests 

table of contents together we rely upon comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we order most of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our contract manufacturer 
purchase commitments with our manufacturers odm oem s are generally on a purchase order basis 
we contract with flextronics international  ltd 
for the repair of some of our products in guadalajara  mexico 
research and development the success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development 
we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
accordingly  we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability  performance and features of our family of products  and designing innovative products to reduce the overall network operating costs of customers 
our product development activities focus on solving the needs of enterprises  data centers  and service providers 
current activities include the continuing development of our innovative switching technology aimed at extending the capabilities of our products 
our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas  including  in particular  g and g ethernet  routing  timing and resiliency protocols  network security  identity management  data center fabrics  and wireless networking 
we continue to enhance the functionality of our modular operating system extremexos which has been designed to provide high reliability and availability 
this allows us to leverage a common operating system across different hardware and network chipsets 
as of june   our research and development organization consisted of employees 
research and development efforts are conducted in several locations  including santa clara  california  raleigh  north carolina  and chennai  india 
our research and development expenses in fiscal years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
competition the market for network switches  which is part of the broader market for networking equipment  is extremely competitive and characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the network switching market are expertise and familiarity with network protocols  network switching and network management  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  adoption of emerging industry standards  customer service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  breadth of product offering  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
we believe that we compete with our competitors with respect to many of the foregoing factors 
however  the market for network switching solutions is dominated by a few large companies  particularly brocade communications systems  inc  cisco systems  inc  hewlett packard company  huawei  and juniper networks inc most of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our 
table of contents intellectual property rights 
as of june   the company has issued patents in the united states and patents outside of the united states 
the expiration dates of the company s issued patents in the united states range from to approximately although the company has patent applications pending  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
with respect to trademarks  we have a number of pending and registered trademarks in the united states and abroad 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we provide our software products to end user customers primarily under shrink wrap license agreements 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
environment we are committed to energy efficiency in our product lines 
for example  some of our products consume less power than offerings from our major competitors under normal operations 
accordingly  we believe this is an area that affords us a competitive advantage for our products in the marketplace 
we maintain compliance with various regulations related to the environment  including the waste electrical and electronic equipment and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment regulations adopted by the european union 
to date  our compliance efforts with various us and foreign regulations related to the environment has not had a material effect on our operating results 
employees as of june   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in research and development  in operations  in customer support and service  and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and no us personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain  train and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement which mandates that the employee render services for any specific term 
the market for qualified personnel is competitive

item a 
risk factors the following is a list of risks and uncertainties which may have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the risks and uncertainties set out below are not the only risks and uncertainties we face  and some are endemic to the networking industry 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future because a number of factors could negatively affect our financial results 
we have a limited history of profitability and have reported losses in some of our prior fiscal years 
in addition  in years when we reported profits  we were not profitable in each quarter during those years 
we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses 
any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could result in a loss for a quarter or full year 
even if we are profitable  our operating results may fall below our expectations and those of our investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 
we may experience challenges or delays in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons and our revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  acceptance provisions in customer contracts  our ability to deliver installation or inspection services by the end of the quarter  changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  a disproportionate percentage of our sales occurring in the last month of the quarter  our ability to ship products by the end of a quarter  reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers spending plans  our ability to forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  sales to the telecommunications service provider market  which represent a significant source of large product orders  are especially volatile and difficult to forecast  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  fluctuations in warranty or other service expenses actually incurred  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase 
due to the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and maintaining profitability 
the market for network switching solutions is intensely competitive and dominated primarily by brocade communications systems  inc  cisco systems inc  hewlett packard company  huawei  and juniper networks  inc most of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  broader product lines and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  
table of contents promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  they have larger distribution channels  stronger brand names  access to more customers  a larger installed customer base and a greater ability to make attractive offers to channel partners and customers than we do 
for example  we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
the pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  increasing pricing pressure on our products and services 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and services  as well as our market share  may decline 
from time to time  we may lower the prices of our products and services in response to competitive pressure 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our revenue and margins will be adversely affected 
industry consolidation may lead to stronger competition and may harm our operating results there has been a trend toward industry consolidation in our markets for several years 
we expect this trend to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry and as companies are acquired or are unable to continue operations 
for example  some of our current and potential competitors for enterprise data center business have made acquisitions  or announced new strategic alliances  designed to position them with the ability to provide end to end technology solutions for the enterprise data center 
companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors  thereby reducing their business with us 
we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors that are better able to compete as sole source vendors for customers 
this could lead to more variability in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
furthermore  particularly in the service provider market  rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customers  with the effect that loss of a major customer could have a material impact on results not anticipated in a customer marketplace composed of more numerous participants 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities 
as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  these benefits may be recognized much later than the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it would be necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin and or revenue 
the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced an erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and technological progress 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors 
we may experience decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margin to decline 
our success is dependent on our ability to continually introduce new products and features that achieve broad market acceptance 
the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
these new products must be compatible and inter operate with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
we have and may in the future experience delays in product development and releases  and such delays have and could in the future adversely affect our ability to compete and our operating results 
when we announce new products or product enhancements or end of sale existing products that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
even if we introduce new switching products  alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
for example  developments in routers and routing software could significantly reduce demand for our products 
as a result  we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our current or future new products 
the unfavorable economic environment has and may continue to negatively impact our business and operating results 
the challenges and uncertainty currently affecting global economic conditions may negatively impact our business and operating results in the following ways customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  the amounts that they owe us which may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  increased pricing pressure may result from our competitors aggressively discounting their products  accurate budgeting and planning will be difficult due to low visibility into future sales  forecasting customer demand will be more difficult  increasing the risk of either excess and obsolete inventory if our forecast is too high or insufficient inventory to meet customer demand if our forecast is too low  and our component suppliers and contract manufacturers have been negatively affected by the economy which may result in product delays and changes in pricing and service levels 
if global economic conditions do not show continued improvement  we believe that we could experience material adverse impacts to our business and operating results 
claims of infringement by others may increase and the resolution of such claims may adversely affect our operating results 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patents  copyrights including rights to open source software  and other intellectual property rights 
because of the existence of a large number of patents in the networking field  the secrecy of some pending patents and the issuance of new patents at a rapid pace  it is not possible to determine in advance if a product or component might infringe the patent rights of others 
because of the potential for courts awarding substantial damages and the lack of predictability of such awards  it is not uncommon for companies in our industry to settle even potentially unmeritorious claims for very substantial amounts 
further  the entities with whom we have or could have disputes or discussions include entities with extensive patent portfolios and substantial financial assets 
these entities are actively engaged in programs to generate substantial revenue from their patent portfolios and are seeking or may seek significant payments or royalties from us and others in our industry 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others has resulted and could in the future 
table of contents result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have received notices from entities alleging that we may be infringing their patents  and we are currently parties to patent litigation as described under part i  item  legal proceedings 
without regard to the merits of these or any other claims  an adverse court order or a settlement could require us  among other actions  to stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  and that license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
in addition  our products include so called open source software 
open source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge  but imposes on the user of the open source software certain requirements to license to others both the open source software as well as modifications to the open source software 
our use of open source software subjects us to certain additional risks for the following reasons open source license terms may be ambiguous and may result in unanticipated obligations regarding our products  open source software cannot be protected under trade secret law  suppliers of open source software do not provide the warranty  support and liability protections typically provided by vendors who offer proprietary software  and it may be difficult for us to accurately determine the developers of the open source code and whether the acquired software infringes third party intellectual property rights 
we believe that even if we do not infringe the rights of others  we will incur significant expenses in the future due to disputes or licensing negotiations  though the amounts cannot be determined 
these expenses may be material or otherwise adversely affect our operating results 
our operating results may be negatively affected by defending or pursuing claims or lawsuits 
we have and may in the future pursue or be subject to claims or lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
in addition to the intellectual property lawsuits described above  we are currently parties to securities and contract litigation as described in item legal proceedings 
regardless of the result  litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a lawsuit in which we are a defendant could result in a court order against us or payments to other parties that would have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
even if we are successful in prosecuting claims and lawsuits  we may not recover damages sufficient to cover our expenses incurred to manage  investigate and pursue the litigation 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees in certain lawsuits 
we do not maintain insurance coverage which will cover all of our litigation costs and liabilities 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business could suffer 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot ensure that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our intellectual property and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology  which would adversely affect our business 
when our products contain undetected errors  we may incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales 
network products frequently contain undetected errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product updates 
we have experienced component problems in prior years that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty  service costs and expenses  and other related operating expenses 
in the future  we expect that  from time to time  such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments 
these problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty  repair and replacement costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects  and such returns exceed the 
table of contents amount we accrued for defective returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of system errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs 
we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  sram  dram  and printed circuit boards  have been in the past  and may in the future be  in short supply 
we have encountered  and are likely in the future to encounter  shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memory  drams and srams  printed circuit boards  and cams 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete inventory  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate supplies of certain materials and components  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer delivery requirements and to recognize revenue 
generally  we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
similar delays may occur in the future 
furthermore  the performance of the components as incorporated in our products may not meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on one manufacturer for our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results 
we primarily rely on one manufacturing partner  alpha networks  inc headquartered in hsinchu  taiwan  to manufacture our products 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from our manufacturing partner in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
these or similar problems may arise in the future  such as delivery of products of inferior quality  delivery of insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
in addition  any natural disaster or business interruption to our manufacturing partner could significantly disrupt our business 
while we maintain strong relationships with our manufacturing partner  our agreements with this manufacturer are generally of limited duration and pricing  quality and volume commitments are negotiated on a recurring basis 
the failure to maintain continuing agreements with our manufacturing partner could adversely affect our business 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we 
table of contents rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturer 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our manufacturing partner by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
our dependence on an oem for all of our wireless products could harm our operating results 
we rely on motorola to provide our wireless products 
if we experience delays in product shipments from our oem or if they experience delays from their suppliers  which in turn delays product shipments to our customers  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
problems such as delivery of products of inferior quality  delivery of insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of our oem  may arise in the future  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue which imposes a number of risks on our business 
international sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenue 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the expansion of international sales 
our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of these resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  higher credit risks requiring cash in advance or letters of credit  difficulties in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  terrorism  war or other armed conflict  natural disasters and epidemics  potential adverse tax consequences  compliance with regulatory requirements of foreign countries  including compliance with rapidly evolving environmental regulations  compliance with us laws and regulations pertaining to the sale and distribution of products to customers in foreign countries  including export controls and the foreign corrupt practices act  and the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations 
all of our international sales are us dollar denominated 
future increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which would expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these foreign currency transactions  we could incur losses from these activities 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results 
our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant channel partners  or if these channel partners are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our channel partners also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
our channel partners may not continue to market or sell our products effectively or to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
we may not be able to successfully manage our sales channels or enter into additional reseller and or distribution 
table of contents agreements 
our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
our operating results for any given period have and will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of channel partners and other customers 
however  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition because our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us and unexpected returns could adversely affect our results 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated 
our products represent a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including risks that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  there may be substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results  and downward pricing pressures could occur during the lengthy sales cycle for our products 
to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals  we must attract  retain  train  motivate  develop and promote key employees  and failure to do so can harm us 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals that mandate that they render services for any specific term  nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we have experienced and may in the future experience significant turnover in our executive personnel 
in addition  retention has generally become more difficult for us  in part because the exercise price of most of the stock options granted to many of our employees is below the market price 
as a result  we experienced high levels of attrition 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  and we have had difficulty in hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the time frame we desire 
companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future 
we could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims  regardless of the merits 
failure of our products to comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations may adversely impact our business 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply 
the network equipment industry in which we compete is characterized by rapid changes in technology and customers requirements and evolving industry standards 
as a result  our success depends on the timely adoption and market acceptance of industry standards  and timely resolution of conflicting us and international industry standards  and our ability to influence the development of emerging industry standards and to introduce new and enhanced products that are compatible with such standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future  we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological 
table of contents changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must also comply with various us federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
in some circumstances  we must obtain regulatory approvals or certificates of compliance before we can offer or distribute our products in certain jurisdictions or to certain customers 
complying with new regulations or obtaining certifications can be costly and disruptive to our business 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or government regulations  we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability 
changes in the effective tax rate including from the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets  or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns or change in ownership  could adversely affect our results 
our future effective tax rates may be volatile or adversely affected by changes in our business or us or foreign tax laws  including the partial or full release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets  expiration of or lapses in the research and development tax credit laws  transfer pricing adjustments  tax effects of stock based compensation  or costs related to restructurings 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
although we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes  there is no assurance that such determinations by us are in fact adequate 
changes in our effective tax rates or amounts assessed upon examination of our tax returns may have a material  adverse impact on our cash flows and our financial condition 
our future effective tax rate in particular could be adversely affected by a change in ownership pursuant to us internal revenue code section if a change in ownership occurs  it may limit our ability to utilize our net operating losses to offset our us taxable income 
if us taxable income is greater than the change in ownership limitation  we will pay a higher rate of tax with respect to the amount of taxable income that exceeds the limitation 
this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
on april   we adopted an amended and restated shareholder rights plan to help protect our assets 
the plan is effective through april  if we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes  our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process 
we need to continue improving our existing  and implement new  operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to  new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis  or to forecast future results 
compliance with laws  rules and regulations relating to corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
federal securities laws  rules and regulations  as well as nasdaq rules and regulations  require companies to maintain extensive corporate governance measures  impose comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  set strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit and other committee members and impose civil and criminal penalties for companies and their chief executive officers  chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
these laws  rules and regulations and the interpretation of these requirements are evolving  and we are making investments to evaluate current practices and to continue to achieve compliance 
our headquarters and some significant supporting businesses are located in northern california and other areas subject to natural disasters that could disrupt our operations and harm our business 
our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region as well as our r d center in north carolina has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  floods and tropical storms  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we have contract manufacturers located in taiwan where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our contract manufacturer 
in addition  the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to the economies of the us and other countries 
if such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders for our products  our business and operating results will suffer 

table of contents we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster  terrorist act or other catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results 
the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price may significantly fluctuate in the future 
in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our results or those of our customers or competition fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors  change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent an acquisition of extreme  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  under which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable 
we rely on the availability of third party licenses some of our products are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties 
it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products 
there can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the inability to obtain certain licenses or other rights or to obtain such licenses or rights on favorable terms  or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
moreover  the inclusion in our products of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products 
market conditions and changes in the industry could lead to discontinuation of our products or businesses resulting in asset impairments in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we may be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses 
any decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit businesses may result in the recording of special charges  such as inventory and technology related write offs  workforce reduction costs  charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities  or claims from third parties who were resellers or users of 
table of contents discontinued products 
our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of assets  including purchased intangible assets  could change as a result of such assessments and decisions 
although in certain instances  our supply agreements allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed  our loss contingencies may include liabilities for contracts that we cannot cancel with contract manufacturers and suppliers 
further  our estimates relating to the liabilities for excess facilities are affected by changes in real estate market conditions 
we intend to invest in engineering  sales  service  marketing and manufacturing on a long term basis  and delays or inability to attain the expected benefits may result in unfavorable operating results while we intend to focus on managing our costs and expenses  over the long term  we also intend to invest in personnel and other resources related to our engineering  sales  service  marketing and manufacturing functions as we focus on our foundational priorities  such as leadership in our core products and solutions and architectures for business transformation 
we are likely to recognize the costs associated with these investments earlier than some of the anticipated benefits and the return on these investments may be lower  or may develop more slowly  than we expect 
if we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these investments  or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed  our operating results may be adversely affected 
if our products do not effectively inter operate with our customers networks and result in cancellations and delays of installations our business could be harmed 
our products are designed to interface with our customers existing networks  each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards and products from other vendors 
many of our customers networks contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these networks have grown and evolved 
our products must inter operate with many or all of the products within these networks as well as future products in order to meet our customers requirements 
if we find errors in the existing software or defects in the hardware used in our customers networks  we may need to modify our software or hardware to fix or overcome these errors so that our products will inter operate and scale with the existing software and hardware  which could be costly and could negatively affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  if our products do not inter operate with those of our customers networks  demand for our products could be adversely affected or orders for our products could be cancelled 
this could hurt our operating results  damage our reputation  and seriously harm our business and prospects

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we develop and sell network infrastructure equipment and offer related services contracts for extended warranty and maintenance to our enterprise  data center and metropolitan telecommunications service provider customers 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our networking equipment and related service contracts 
in our fiscal year ended june   our revenue decreased million  gross profit decreased million  operating profit increased million and net income increased million as compared to fiscal we believe that understanding the following key developments is helpful to an understanding of our operating results for the fiscal year ended june  impact of the global economic developments although our net income and earnings per share both increased in fiscal  we believe that the credit market crisis  slow economic recovery in the united states  and other challenges affecting global economic conditions placed significant limitations on our financial performance 
we operate in three regions americas  which includes the united states  canada  mexico  central america and south america  emea  which includes europe  middle east  and africa  and apac which includes asia pacific  south asia and japan 
sales in the apac and some european countries were most impacted as a result of the soft global economy and the global credit crisis in the financial market and certain european countries 
we believe that limited access to credit  conservative purchasing patterns and delays or cancellation of it infrastructure plans in the face of continued uncertainty regarding the global economy  may continue to negatively impact overall demand for networking solutions  including ethernet equipment 
we have taken and plan to continue to take other steps to manage our business in the current economic environment 
for example  we have managed from time to time our contingent work force  reduced travel and other discretionary spending  realigned our product portfolio and organization to grow revenue and operating income  and controlled all hiring activities 
increasing demand for bandwidth we believe that the continued increase in demand for bandwidth will over time drive future demand for high performance ethernet solutions 
wide spread adoption of electronic communications in all aspects of our lives  proliferation of next generation converged mobile devices and deployment of triple play services to residences and businesses alike  continues to generate demand for greater network performance across broader geographic locations 
in parallel to these transformational forces within society and the community at large  the accelerating adoption of internet and intranet cloud solutions within business enterprises is enabling organizations to offer greater business scalability to improve efficiency and through more effective operations  improve profitability 
in order to realize the benefits of these developments  customers require additional bandwidth and high performance from their network infrastructure at affordable prices 
we are seeing the initial indications that the ethernet segment of the networking equipment market will return to growth as enterprise  data center and carrier customers continue to recognize the performance and operating cost benefits of ethernet technology 
expanding product portfolio we believe that continued success in our marketplace is dependent upon a variety of factors that includes  but is not limited to  our ability to design  develop and distribute new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
during the past year we further extended our ethernet product portfolio through the addition of the blackdiamond bd x  a highly scalable core switch for it and cloud data centers  the summit x for the intelligent edge  the summit x for data center top of rack deployments  the eg cell site router family for mobile backhaul  and a revamp of our ridgeline network management platform industry developments the market for network infrastructure equipment is highly competitive and dominated by a few large companies 
the current economic climate has further driven consolidation of vendors within the ethernet networking market and with vendors from adjacent markets  including storage  security  wireless and voice applications 
we believe that the underpinning technology for all of these adjacent markets is ethernet 
as a result  independent ethernet switch vendors are being acquired or merged with larger  adjacent market vendors to enable them to deliver complete and broad solutions 
as an independent ethernet switch vendor  we must provide products that  when combined with the products of our large strategic partners  create compelling solutions for end user customers 
our approach is to focus on the intelligence and automation layer that spans our hardware products and that facilitates end to end solutions  as opposed to positioning extreme networks as a low cost vendor with point products 
lower overall market growth has also created an environment of declining margins due to increased competition between the remaining vendors in this space 
during the last year  overall ethernet port counts have grown  while industry revenues have decreased  signaling a decline in average selling price 
our product life cycle and operational cost reduction efforts are therefore even more 
table of contents critical for margin preservation 
realignment of corporate strategies in fiscal  we commenced a strategy to focus on growing revenue in specific market verticals and on improving operational effectiveness 
as part of this corporate realignment we recorded a charge of million during the fiscal year ended june  amendment to rights agreement on april   our board of directors of the company adopted an amended and restated rights agreement between extreme networks and computershare shareholder services llc as the rights agent 
the restated rights plan governs the terms of each right right that has been issued with respect to each share of common stock of extreme networks 
each right initially represents the right to purchase one one thousandth of a share of series a preferred stock of extreme networks 
the restated rights plan replaces in its entirety the rights agreement  dated as of april   as amended on june  and april   between extreme networks and mellon investor services llc the prior rights plan 
the board reviewed the necessity of the provision of the prior rights plan adopted to preserve the value of extreme networks deferred tax assets  including its net operating loss carry forwards  with respect to its ability to fully use its tax benefits to offset future income may be limited if it experiences an ownership change for purposes of section of the internal revenue code of as a result of ordinary buying and selling of extreme networks common stock 
following its review  the board decided it was necessary and in the best interests of extreme networks and its stockholders to enter into the restated rights plan the restated rights plan incorporates the prior rights plan and the amendments thereto into a single agreement and extends the term of the prior rights plan from april  to april  results of operations effective june   we changed our fiscal period to coincide with calendar month end 
previously  we used a fiscal week manufacturing calendar year 
accordingly  the fiscal year ended june  has weeks compared to weeks in and weeks in fiscal our operations and financial performance have been affected by the economic factors described above  and during fiscal  we achieved the following results net revenue of million  a decrease of from fiscal net revenue of million

the decreases were also a result of elimination of certain products and product mix shift 
product revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to growth in our asia pacific region and select strategic partners such as ericsson ab  which accounted for of our overall business  as well as increasing stability in the emea market 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced supply constraint issues which resulted in the loss of business 
service revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulting from a significant one time renewal contract for a single customer and maintenance contract extensions 
service revenue was flat in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to the reduction of maintenance revenue for end of life products  offset by growth in new value added services  coupled with maintenance service contracts attached to increased product sales 
as noted previously  we operate in three regions americas  which includes the united states  canada  mexico  central america and south america  emea  which includes europe  middle east  and africa  and apac which includes asia pacific  south asia and japan

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are reviewed on an ongoing basis and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
share based payments we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of option awards  and share purchase options under our employee stock purchase plan espp on the date of grant with the weighted average assumptions 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected term of purchase options under our espp represents the contractual life of the espp purchase period 
the risk free rate based upon the estimated life of the option and espp award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on both the implied volatilities from traded options on our stock and historical volatility on our stock 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in fiscal  our estimated forfeiture rates based on historical forfeiture experiences are for executives and for non executive employees 
we use the straight line method for expense attribution  and we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to maintenance service contracts  professional services  and training for our products 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price of the product is fixed or determinable  and the collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
in instances where any of the criteria for revenue recognition are not met  we defer revenue until all criteria have been met 
product revenue from our value added resellers  non stocking distributors and end user customers is recognized at the time of shipment  provided that all of the foregoing revenue recognition requirements have been satisfied 
we generally do not grant return privileges  except for defective products during the warranty period  nor do we grant pricing credits 
accordingly  we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for sales incentives and other programs that we may make available to our partners  based on historical experience or applicable contractual terms 
shipping costs are included in cost of product revenues 
sales taxes collected from customers are excluded from revenues 
we also sell our products to distributors that stock inventory and sell to resellers 
we defer recognition of revenue on all sales to our stocking distributors until the distributors have sold the products  as evidenced by sales data that the distributors provide to us 
we grant stocking distributors certain price protection rights and the right to return a portion of unsold inventory for the purpose of stock rotation 
the distributor related deferred revenue and receivables are adjusted at the time of the stock rotation return or price reduction 
we also provide stocking distributors with credits for changes in selling prices based on competitive conditions  and provide funding for our distributors and their resellers to perform marketing development activities 
we maintain estimated accruals and allowances for these exposures based upon our contractual obligations 
our marketing 
table of contents development channel programs do not meet the criteria for recognizing the costs as marketing expenses and therefore these costs are accrued as a reduction to revenue in the same period that the products are sold 
revenue from service contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual service period  which is typically from one to two years 
professional service revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
our networking products are tangible products that contain software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple deliverables comprised of our tangible products  standalone software licenses  and service offerings depending on the distribution sales channel through which the products are sold and the requirements of our customers 
we recognize revenue for our multiple deliverable arrangements in accordance with the accounting standard for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which provides guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and how consideration should be allocated 
the industry specific software revenue recognition guidance generally does not apply to the sales of our tangible products 
software revenue guidance is applied to sales of our standalone software products  including software upgrades and software that is not essential to the functionality of the hardware with which it is sold 
pursuant to the guidance of the accounting standard for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based on the relative selling price of each element 
we determine the standalone selling price for each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
under the selling price hierarchy  the selling price for each deliverable is based on our vendor specific objective evidence of selling price vsoe  which is determined by a substantial majority of our historical standalone sales transactions for a product or service falling within a reasonable range 
if vsoe is not available due to a lack of standalone sales transactions or lack of pricing within a narrow range  then third party evidence tpe  as determined by the standalone pricing of competitive vendor products in similar markets  is used 
tpe typically is difficult to establish due to the proprietary differences of competitive products and difficulty in obtaining reliable competitive standalone pricing information 
when neither vsoe nor tpe is available  we determine the best estimate of standalone selling price esp for a product or service by considering several factors including  but not limited to  the month historical median sales price  sales channels  geography  gross margin consistency  competitive product pricing  and product life cycle 
in consideration of all relevant pricing factors  we apply management judgment to determine the best estimate of selling price through consultation with and formal approval by our management for all products and services for which neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
generally the standalone selling price of services is determined using vsoe and the standalone selling price of all other deliverables is determined by using esp 
we regularly review vsoe  tpe and esp for all of our products and services and maintain internal controls over the establishment and updates of these estimates 
pursuant to the software revenue recognition accounting standard  we continue to recognize revenue for software using the residual method for our sales of standalone software products  including optional software upgrades  and other software that is not essential to the functionality of the hardware with which it is sold 
after allocation of the relative selling price to each element of the multiple deliverable arrangement  we recognize revenue in accordance with our policies for product  software  and service revenue recognition 
our total deferred product revenue from customers other than distributors was million and million as of june  and july   respectively 
our total deferred revenue for services  primarily from service contracts  was million as of june  and million as of july  service contracts typically range from one to two years 
shipping costs are included in cost of product revenues 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million as of june  and july   respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable 
if the historical data that we use to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future levels of product returns  these estimates will be revised  thus resulting in an impact on future net revenue 
we estimate and adjust this allowance at each balance sheet date 
inventory valuation our inventory balance was million as of june   compared with million as of july  we value our inventory at lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances based on excess and obsolete inventories determined primarily by the age of inventory 
at the point of the loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
any written down or obsolete inventory subsequently sold has not had a material impact on gross margin for any of the periods disclosed 
inventory write downs charged to cost of product revenue were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  intangible assets  and service inventory which we hold to support customers 
table of contents who have purchased service contracts with a hardware replacement element 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets or asset groups may not be recoverable 
if such facts and circumstances exist  we assess the recoverability of the long lived assets by comparing the projected un discounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairments  if any  are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
accrued warranty networking products may contain undetected hardware or software errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
in the past  we had experienced such errors in connection with products and product updates 
our standard hardware warranty period is typically months from the date of shipment to end users and days for software 
for certain access products  we offer a limited lifetime hardware warranty commencing on the date of shipment from us and ending five years following the our announcement of the end of sale of such product 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue a liability through charges to cost of product revenue for this amount 
our accrued warranty balance was million and million as of june  and july   respectively 
the determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment 
we estimate and adjust this accrual at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
the cost of new warranties issued that was charged to cost of product revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million and million as of june  and july   respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade accounts receivable was million and million as of june  and july   respectively 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asia pacific region  excluding japan and australia  to pay cash in advance or secure letters of credit when placing an order with us 
our provision for doubtful accounts was an expense of  in fiscal  benefit of  in fiscal and expense of  in fiscal deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
in fiscal  the valuation allowance decreased by million to million  and in fiscal  the valuation allowance decreased by million to million 
we have not provided a valuation allowance against any of our non us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period was given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our us cumulative losses during those periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our us federal and state net deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we had unrecognized tax benefits of million as of june  if fully recognized in the future  million would impact our effective tax rate  and million would result in adjustments to deferred tax assets and corresponding adjustments to the valuation allowance 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrealized tax benefit could decrease by approximately million during the next twelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain foreign jurisdictions 

table of contents legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings  including negotiations regarding potential licenses from third parties who have notified us that they believe our products may infringe certain patents 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter  whether litigation or licensing negotiation  and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
for further detail  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
asu requires one of two alternatives for presenting comprehensive income and eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components as a part of the consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
additionally  asu requires presentation on the face of the financial statements reclassification adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement s where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the requirement related to the reclassification adjustments from other comprehensive income to net income was deferred in december  as a result of the issuance of asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update topic 
the amendments in asu  as amended by asu  do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
asu  as amended by asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december  and is to be applied retrospectively 
we will adopt asu during the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of asu  as amended by asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact its valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities  discount rates and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
if the current market conditions deteriorate further  or the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  we may be required to record impairment charges in future quarters 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and july  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are generally not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands june  included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands july  included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at june  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
table of contents unrealized gain given a decrease in interest rate of x bps fair value as of unrealized loss given an increase in interest rate of x bps bps bps june  bps bps in thousands exchange rate sensitivity currently  substantially all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars and  as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we conduct some sales transactions and incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant  in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below 
foreign exchange forward contracts we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in earnings as other income expense 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses and re measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona  the indian rupee and the british pound 
these derivatives do not qualify as hedges 
at june   these forward foreign currency contracts had a notional principal amount of million and unrealized gains on foreign exchange contracts of million 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses from operations were a gain of million in fiscal  a loss of million in fiscal and a loss of million in fiscal
