except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  breatheway packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market in september  intelimer polymer systems that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications in june and for personal care applications in november  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of in addition  on april   the company acquired lifecore which develops and manufactures products utilizing hyaluronan  a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues in both animals and humans 
landec has four core businesses food products technology  food export  hyaluronan based biomaterials and technology licensing 
the food products technology segment combines the company s intelimer packaging technology with apio s fresh cut and whole produce business 
the food export business is operated through apio s cal ex export company which purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to predominantly asian markets 
the hyaluronan based biomaterials business sells products utilizing hyaluronan in the ophthalmic  orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies hyaluronan to customers pursuing other medical applications  such as aesthetic surgery  medical device coatings  tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals 
the technology licensing business includes our proprietary intellicoat seed coating technology and our intelimer polymer business that licenses and or supplies products to companies such as air products and nitta 
see business description of core business 
as of may   the company s retained earnings were million 
the company may incur losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates that require management s most significant and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation of intangible assets and inventory  the valuation of investments  and the valuation and recognition of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments 
the analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve  and are subject to change from period to period 
the actual results may differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be usable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses 
the company takes title to all produce it trades and or packages  and therefore  records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the consolidated statements of income 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement  including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
goodwill and other intangibles the company s intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve to thirteen years and trademarks trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives collectively  intangible assets  which the company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance i upon the acquisition of greenline by apio in april  ii upon the acquisition of lifecore in april and iii upon the acquisition of apio in december accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition 
all intangible assets  including goodwill  associated with the acquisition of lifecore was allocated to our ha based biomaterials reporting unit and the acquisitions of apio and greenline were allocated to our food products technology reporting unit pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit 
as of may   the ha based biomaterials reporting unit had million of goodwill and the food products technology reporting unit had million of goodwill 
the million of goodwill in the technology licensing reporting unit was written off during the year ended may  the company tests its intangible assets for impairment at least annually  in accordance with accounting guidance 
application of the intangible assets impairment tests requires significant judgment by management  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of intangible assets to reporting units  and the determination of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset and reporting unit based upon projections of future net cash flows  discount rates and market multiples  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
when evaluating indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  the company compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  the company first compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value to determine if there is an impairment loss 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not considered impaired  thus application of the second step of the two step approach under accounting guidance is not required 
the company tested its indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment as of july  and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of the intangible assets were necessary as of that date 
on a quarterly basis  the company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its intangible assets  based on management s assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation 
such changes  if significant or material  could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the intangible assets during the current period 
the results of these tests could lead to write downs of the carrying values of the intangible assets in the current period 
finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the company s impairment review requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines  future sales volumes  revenue and expense growth rates  alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from the disposal of the assets 
the company conducts quarterly reviews of idle and underutilized equipment  and reviews business plans for possible impairment indicators 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows and the impairment is viewed as other than temporary 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the asset s book value and its estimated fair value 
depending on the asset  estimated fair value may be determined either by use of a discounted cash flow model or by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of assets and would increase or decrease any impairment measurement 
the company uses the discounted cash flow dcf approach to develop an estimate of fair value 
the dcf approach recognizes that current value is premised on the expected receipt of future economic benefits 
indications of value are developed by discounting projected future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the market approach is not used to value the company s reporting units the reporting units because insufficient market comparables exist to enable the company to develop a reasonable fair value of its intangible assets due to the unique nature of each of the company s reporting units 
the dcf approach requires the company to exercise judgment in determining future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future product sales  which are inherently difficult to predict 
these net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the dcf associated with the food products technology reporting unit is based on management s five year projection of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of apio and the industry categories in which apio operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the estimated fair value of the food products technology reporting unit as of july  exceeded its net book value by and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
for the test performed as of july   the projected cash flow from operations for determining the dcf for fiscal year was million for the food products technology reporting unit 
the actual cash flow from operations for fiscal year was million 
the difference of million was primarily due to the timing of working capital changes 
the dcf associated with the ha based biomaterials reporting unit is based on management s five year projections of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of lifecore and the industry categories in which lifecore operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the trade name intangible asset was valued using the relief from royalty valuation method and the customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of consideration paid  including the fair value of contingent consideration under the terms of the purchase agreement  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company updated its analysis of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill as of its annual impairment analysis date  concluding that the fair value of the hyaluronan based biomaterials reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  exceeded its net book value by  and therefore  no intangible asset impairment was deemed to exist 
for the test performed as of july   the projected cash flow from operations for determining the dcf for fiscal year was a negative million due to the projected earn out payment  see note for the ha based biomaterials reporting unit 
the actual cash flow from operations for fiscal year was a positive million 
the difference of million is primarily due to lifecore paying the million earn out payment in june after the fiscal year end for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
at may   the company had a valuation allowance of  against deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has accrued  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate 
any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
stock based compensation the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
in addition  the accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurement accounting for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the company has elected the fair value option for its investment in a non public company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has not elected the fair value option for any of its other eligible financial assets or liabilities 
the accounting guidance established a three tier hierarchy for fair value measurements  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data 
level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which would require the company to develop its own assumptions 
as of may   the company held certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash equivalents  marketable securities  interest rate swap and liability for contingent consideration in connection with the acquisition of greenline and its minority interest investment in windset 
the fair value of the company s cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on observable inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets 
therefore  the company has categorized its cash equivalents and marketable securities as level the fair value of the company s interest rate swap is determined based on model inputs that can be observed in a liquid market and key inputs include yield curves and are categorized as level inputs 
during the year ended may   as a result of the company refinancing lifecore s debt with bmo harris and using those proceeds to extinguish the wells fargo bank debt  the swap was no longer considered effective as a hedge 
as a result  the company charged  to other income expense representing the market value of the swap at the date of the debt extinguishment 
future changes in the value of the interest rate swap will be recorded as an increase or decrease to other income 
the interest rate swap liability is included in other non current liabilities as of may  and may  the fair value of the company s liability for contingent consideration is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a level measurement 
the company determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its investment in windset 
the fair value of the company s investment in windset utilizes significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models  including projected cash flows  growth rate assumptions for income and expenses and the discount rate  and is therefore considered level  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position 
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
recent accounting pronouncements recently issued pronouncements intangibles goodwill and other in september  the fasb issued new guidance that will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this guidance  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect that the adoption of this update will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
presentation of comprehensive income in december  the fasb issued new guidance that improves the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this standard require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under either method  adjustments must be displayed for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income oci to net income  in both net income and oci 
the standard does not change the current option for presenting components of oci gross or net of the effect of income taxes  provided that such tax effects are presented in the statement in which oci is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  the standard does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurement in may  the fasb issued new guidance which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  this guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
additional disclosure requirements in the update include for level fair value measurements  quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs  for an entity s use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the asset s highest and best use  the reason for the difference  for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required  the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined  and the disclosure of all transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
the new guidance will become effective for the company on december  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements  however  presentation of disclosures around fair value measurements will be expanded to conform to the requirements of the new guidance for all periods presented 
disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in november  the fasb issued new guidance which is effective for annual reporting periods beginning january  this guidance amends the disclosure requirements around offsetting to enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
entities are required to disclose both gross and net information about the instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
results of operations fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  revenues in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change apio value added apio packaging food technology apio export total apio ha technology licensing total revenues apio value added apio s value added revenues consist of revenues generated from the sale of specialty packaged fresh cut and whole value added processed vegetable products that are washed and packaged in our proprietary packaging and sold under apio s eat smart and greenline brands and various private labels 
in addition  value added revenues include the revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a vegetable cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
the increase in apio s value added revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the following factors a increase in unit volume sales to existing customers resulting primarily from expanded product offerings  gaining additional distribution locations and growth in the fresh cut vegetable category  million of revenues from greenline from the acquisition date of april  through the fiscal year ended may  and a larger percentage of apio s value added revenues being generated from sales to club stores rather than retail grocery chains 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a product mix change in retail grocery chains to lower priced products from higher priced products 
apio packaging apio packaging revenues consist of apio s packaging technology business using its breatheway membrane technology 
the first commercial application included in apio packaging is our banana packaging technology 
commercial sales of membranes for avocados began in fiscal year the decrease in apio packaging revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to decreased sales of breatheway membranes to chiquita for packaged avocados as a result of chiquita placing large initial orders of membranes during the first half of fiscal year to build inventory 
apio export apio export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to asia by cal ex 
apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit 
the increase in revenues in apio s export business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a increase in export unit volume sales due to a greater volume of fruit and vegetables being available to export and due to more favorable pricing for export products in fiscal year compared to fiscal year ha based biomaterials lifecore principally generates revenue through the sale of products containing ha 
lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas ophthalmic  which represented nearly of lifecore s revenues in fiscal year  orthopedic  which represented nearly of lifecore s revenues in fiscal year and veterinary other 
the increase in revenues for lifecore is due to an increase in sales to existing customers 
technology licensing technology licensing revenues consisted of revenues generated from the licensing agreements with monsanto  air products and nitta 
the decrease in technology licensing revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the termination of the monsanto agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the quarterly revenues and gross profit for the technology licensing business from monsanto had been million per quarter prior to the termination

many of these factors influence or are interrelated with other factors 
the company includes in cost of sales all of the costs related to the sale of products in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these costs include the following raw materials including produce  casein  seeds and packaging  direct labor  overhead including indirect labor  depreciation  and facility related costs and shipping and shipping related costs 
the following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the increase in gross profit for apio s value added vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the increase in revenues and the decrease in costs of produce as compared to the costs associated with the weather related produce supply issues experienced during the november to february period of fiscal year apio packaging the decrease in apio packaging gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to decreased sales of breatheway membranes to chiquita for use for avocado applications as a result of chiquita placing initial large orders of breatheway membranes during the first half of last year to build inventory 
apio export apio s export business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range 
the increase in gross profit for apio s export business during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the increase in revenues and higher average margins on export sales due to a more favorable product mix in fiscal year compared to fiscal year hyaluronan based biomaterials lifecore operates in the higher margin medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin of approximately 
the increase in lifecore s gross profit during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the increase in revenues 
technology licensing the decrease in technology licensing gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period of the prior year was primarily due to the termination of the monsanto agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the quarterly revenues and gross profit for the technology licensing business from monsanto had been million per quarter prior to the termination

research and development efforts at apio are focused on the company s proprietary breatheway membranes used for packaging produce  with recent focus on extending the shelf life of bananas and other shelf life sensitive vegetables and fruit 
in the ha business  the research and development efforts primarily relate to technical development efforts to support customer specific product requests or process improvements  under which technical modifications are made to existing products or processes to meet customer specific needs and such work can also lead to new products or processes 
in the technology licensing business  the research and development efforts are focused on uses for the proprietary intelimer polymers outside of food and ha 
the increase in research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to increased payroll expenses from increased research and development efforts associated with new product development in our ha business 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses at apio 
due to the increase in revenues  the company experienced higher brokerage fees and due to apio and the company exceeding their revenue and operating income plan for fiscal year  bonuses expenses were higher than the same period of last year 
other operating expenses other operating expenses in fiscal year consisted primarily of expenses incurred as a result of the acquisition of greenline 
other operating expenses in fiscal year consisted of an impairment charge from the write off of landec ag s goodwill 
non operating income expense in thousands fiscal year ended may  fiscal year ended may  change dividend income interest income interest expense other income income taxes non controlling interest dividend income the increase in dividend income was due to the receipt of a full year of dividends during fiscal year from the million preferred stock investment in windset see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preferred stock yields a cash dividend of annually 
the  for fiscal year represents dividends for the period february  through may  interest income the decrease in interest income for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to lower cash balances reflecting our use of cash to purchase greenline  to purchase our minority investment in windset and to purchase the company s common stock on the open market 
interest income was further negatively impacted by lower yields on investments due to declines in interest rates 
interest expense the increase in interest expense during the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was due to interest on the debt incurred in the acquisition of greenline and expensing of  in loan origination fees as a result of paying off the wells fargo credit facility 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in interest expenses at lifecore due to paying down its debt by million during fiscal year other income other income consists primarily of a million increase in the fair market value of our windset investment see note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by a  expense related to the amortization of the discount on lifecore s earn out obligation and  in expense associated with the interest rate swap with wells fargo see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the increase in the income tax expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal years is due to a increase in income before taxes partially offset by a decrease in the company s effective tax rate to in fiscal year down from in fiscal year the effective tax rates for fiscal year differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of percent as a result of several factors  including state taxes  non deductible stock based compensation expense  tax exempt interest and non deductible acquisition related expenses 
non controlling interest the non controlling interest consists of the limited partners equity interest in the net income of apio cooling  lp

in addition  value added revenues include the revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a produce cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position 
apio s value added revenues for the fiscal year ended may  were unchanged compared to the fiscal year ended may  this was primarily due to increased unit sales volumes related to new product introductions which increased unit sales volumes by and from a larger percentage of apio s value added revenues being generated from sales to club stores rather than retail grocery chains 
these increases in revenue were virtually completely offset by less promotional activity in apio s value added business which reduced unit sales volumes by and due to apio exiting business that would have resulted in less than acceptable gross profit margins which reduced unit sales volumes by another

the following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above 
apio value added the decrease in gross profit for apio s value added specialty packaging vegetable business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to shortages of produce resulting from cold and wet weather in california during the company s third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal year which reduced gross profit by approximately million 
these decreases were partially offset by a year over year mix change to greater sales of higher margin tray products from lower margin products and fewer promotions on bag products compared to the same period last year 
apio packaging the increase in gross profit for apio packaging for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the fiscal year ended may  was not significant to consolidated landec gross profit 
apio export apio s export business is a buy sell business that realizes a commission based margin in the range
