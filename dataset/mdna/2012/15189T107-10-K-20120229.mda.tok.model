subsidiaries of cerc corp 
own interstate natural gas pipelines and gas gathering systems and provide various ancillary services 
a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp 
offers variable and fixed price physical natural gas supplies primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities 
business segments in this management s discussion and analysis  we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments 
we also discuss our liquidity  capital resources and certain critical accounting policies 
we are first and foremost an energy delivery company and it is our intention to remain focused on this segment of the energy business 
the results of our business operations are significantly impacted by weather  customer growth  economic conditions  cost management  rate proceedings before regulatory agencies and other actions of the various regulatory agencies to whose jurisdiction we are subject 
our electric transmission and distribution services are subject to rate regulation and are reported in the electric transmission distribution business segment  as are impacts of generation related stranded costs and other true up balances recoverable by the regulated electric utility 
our natural gas distribution services are also subject to rate regulation and are reported in the natural gas distribution business segment 
a summary of our reportable business segments as of december  is set forth below electric transmission distribution our electric transmission and distribution operations provide electric transmission and distribution services to retail electric providers reps serving over two million metered customers in a  square mile area of the texas gulf coast that has a population of approximately six million people and includes the city of houston 
on behalf of reps  centerpoint houston delivers electricity from power plants to substations  from one substation to another and to retail electric customers in locations throughout centerpoint houston s certificated service territory 
the electric reliability council of texas  inc ercot serves as the regional reliability coordinating council for member electric power systems in texas 
ercot membership is open to consumer groups  investor and municipally owned electric utilities  rural electric cooperatives  independent generators  power marketers  river authorities and reps 
the ercot market represents approximately of the demand for power in texas and is one of the nation s largest power markets 
transmission and distribution services are provided under tariffs approved by the public utility commission of texas texas utility commission 
natural gas distribution cerc owns and operates our regulated natural gas distribution business gas operations  which engages in intrastate natural gas sales to  and natural gas transportation for  approximately million residential  commercial and industrial customers in arkansas  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  oklahoma and texas 
competitive natural gas sales and services cerc s operations also include non rate regulated natural gas sales to  and transportation services for  commercial and industrial customers in states in the central and eastern regions of the united states 
interstate pipelines cerc s interstate pipelines business owns and operates approximately  miles of natural gas transmission lines primarily located in arkansas  illinois  louisiana  missouri  oklahoma and texas 
it also owns and operates six natural gas storage fields with a combined daily deliverability of approximately billion cubic feet bcf and a combined working gas capacity of approximately bcf 
it owns a interest in southeast supply header  llc sesh

most storage operations are in north louisiana and oklahoma 
field services cerc s field services business owns and operates approximately  miles of gathering pipelines and processing plants that collect  treat and process natural gas primarily from three regions located in major producing fields in arkansas  louisiana  oklahoma and texas 
it also owns a general partnership interest in waskom gas processing company waskom 
waskom owns a natural gas processing plant and natural gas gathering assets located in east texas 
waskom s plant is capable of processing approximately million cubic feet mmcf per day of natural gas  and its gathering assets are capable of gathering approximately mmcf per day of natural gas 
other operations our other operations business segment includes office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations 
executive summary factors influencing our business we are an energy delivery company 
the majority of our revenues are generated from the gathering  processing  transportation and sale of natural gas and the transportation and delivery of electricity by our subsidiaries 
we do not own or operate electric generating facilities or make retail sales to end use electric customers 
to assess our financial performance  our management primarily monitors operating income and cash flows from our business segments 
within these broader financial measures  we monitor margins  operation and maintenance expense  interest expense  capital spending and working capital requirements 
in addition to these financial measures we also monitor a number of variables that management considers important to the operation of our business segments  including the number of customers  throughput  use per customer  commodity prices and heating and cooling degree days 
we also monitor system reliability  safety factors and customer satisfaction to gauge our performance 
to the extent adverse economic conditions affect our suppliers and customers  results from our energy delivery businesses may suffer 
reduced demand and lower energy prices could lead to financial pressure on some of our customers who operate within the energy industry 
also  adverse economic conditions  coupled with concerns for protecting the environment  may cause consumers to use less energy or avoid expansions of their facilities  resulting in less demand for our services 
performance of our electric transmission distribution and natural gas distribution business segments is significantly influenced by the number of customers and energy usage per customer 
weather conditions can have a significant impact on energy usage  and we compare our results on a weather adjusted basis 
the houston area experienced extremely hot and dry weather during  and each month from april through september was one of the ten warmest months on record 
in recent years  we have seen evidence that customers are seeking to reduce their energy consumption 
reduced consumption can adversely affect our results 
however  due to a stabilization of energy prices and continued economic recovery in the areas we serve  the trend toward lower usage has slowed somewhat 
in addition  in many of our service areas  particularly in the houston area and in minnesota  we have benefited from growth in the number of customers that also tends to mitigate the effects of reduced consumption 
we anticipate that this growth will continue as the regions experience a continued economic recovery 
the profitability of our businesses is influenced significantly by the regulatory treatment we receive from the various state and local regulators who set our electric and gas distribution rates 
in recent rate filings  we have sought rate mechanisms that help to decouple our results from the impacts of weather and conservation  but such rate mechanisms have not yet been approved in all jurisdictions 
we plan to continue to pursue such decoupling mechanisms in our rate filings 
our field services and interstate pipelines business segments are currently benefiting from their proximity to new natural gas producing regions in texas  arkansas  oklahoma and louisiana 
our interstate pipelines business segment benefited from new projects placed into service in on our carthage to perryville line  including a backhaul agreement that expired in in our field services business segment  the development of shale formations has helped offset declines in production from more traditional basins 
the recent decline in natural gas prices has contributed to reductions in drilling activity in dry gas shale formations as well  including those served by our field services business segment 
many producers have shifted their focus to liquids rich natural gas or crude oil basins 
a reduction in drilling activity may result in lower throughput volumes on our systems as the wells decline over time 
however  a significant amount of the volumes gathered by systems we recently developed in shale basins such as the haynesville and fayetteville shales are supported by contracts with annual volume commitments  or price adjustment mechanisms that provide for minimum returns on capital deployed 
in monitoring performance of the segments  we focus on throughput of the pipelines and gathering systems  and in the case of field services  on well connects 
our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment contracts with customers for transportation  storage and sales of natural gas on an unregulated basis 
its operations serve customers in the central and eastern regions of the united states 
the segment benefits from favorable price differentials  either on a geographic basis or on a seasonal basis 
while it utilizes financial derivatives to hedge its exposure to price movements  it does not engage in speculative or proprietary trading and maintains a low value at risk level  or var  to avoid significant financial exposures 
lower geographic and seasonal price differentials during and adversely affected results for this business segment 
the nature of our businesses requires significant amounts of capital investment  and we rely on internally generated cash  borrowings under our credit facilities  proceeds from commercial paper and issuances of debt and equity in the capital markets to satisfy these capital needs 
we strive to maintain investment grade ratings for our securities in order to access the capital markets on terms we consider reasonable 
our goal is to improve our credit ratings over time 
a reduction in our ratings generally would increase our borrowing costs for new issuances of debt  as well as borrowing costs under our existing revolving credit facilities  and may prevent us from accessing the commercial paper markets 
disruptions in the financial markets  such as occurred in the last half of and continued during  can also affect the availability of new capital on terms we consider attractive 
in those circumstances  companies like us may not be able to obtain certain types of external financing or may be required to accept terms less favorable than they would otherwise accept 
for that reason  we seek to maintain adequate liquidity for our businesses through existing credit facilities and prudent refinancing of existing debt 
as it did with many businesses  the sharp decline in stock market values during the latter part of had a significant adverse impact on the value of our pension plan assets 
while that impact did not require us to make additional contributions to the pension plan  it significantly increased the pension expense we recognized during we expect to make a minimum required contribution to our pension plan of million in and may need to make larger contributions in subsequent years 
consistent with the regulatory treatment of such costs  we can defer the amount of pension expense that differs from the level of pension expense included in our base rates for our electric transmission distribution business segment 
legislation effective in september allows a gas utility in texas to defer until the utility s next rate case the difference between what is currently being included in its rates and the amount determined actuarially for pension and post employment benefits 
significant events resolution of true up appeal in march  centerpoint houston filed a true up application with the texas utility commission requesting recovery of associated costs of billion  excluding interest  as allowed under the texas electric choice plan 
in december  the texas utility commission issued its final order true up order allowing centerpoint houston to recover a true up balance of approximately billion  which included interest through august   and provided for adjustment of the amount to be recovered to include interest on the balance until recovery  along with the principal portion of additional excess mitigation credits returned to customers after august  and certain other adjustments 
to reflect the impact of the true up order  in and  we recorded a net after tax extraordinary loss of million 
various parties  including centerpoint houston  appealed the true up order 
these appeals were heard first by a district court in travis county  texas  then by the texas third court of appeals and finally by the texas supreme court 
in march  the texas supreme court issued a unanimous ruling on such appeals in which it affirmed in part and reversed in part the decision of the texas utility commission 
in june  the texas supreme court issued a final mandate remanding the case to the texas utility commission for further proceedings the remand proceeding 
in september  centerpoint houston reached an agreement in principle with the staff of the texas utility commission and certain intervenors to settle the issues in the remand proceeding the settlement 
in october  the texas utility commission approved a final order the final order in the remand proceeding consistent with the settlement 
the final order provided that i centerpoint houston was entitled to recover an additional true up balance of billion the recoverable true up balance in the remand proceeding  ii no further interest would accrue on the recoverable true up balance  and iii centerpoint houston would reimburse certain parties for their reasonable rate case expenses 
in october  the texas utility commission also issued a financing order the financing order that authorized the issuance of transition bonds by centerpoint houston to securitize the recoverable true up balance 
in january  centerpoint energy transition bond company iv  llc bond company iv  a new special purpose subsidiary of centerpoint houston  issued billion of transition bonds in three tranches with interest rates ranging from to and final maturity dates ranging from april  to october  through the issuance of these transition bonds  centerpoint houston recovered the recoverable true up balance  less approximately million of offering expenses 
the transition bonds will be repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers in centerpoint houston s service territory 
as a result of the final order  centerpoint houston recorded a pre tax extraordinary gain of million million after tax and million million after tax of other income related to a portion of interest on the appealed amount 
an additional million million after tax will be recorded as an equity return over the life of the transition bonds 
magnolia and olympia gathering systems in september  centerpoint energy field services  llc cefs entered into long term agreements with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of encana corporation encana and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of royal dutch shell plc shell to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain haynesville shale and bossier shale formations in louisiana 
pursuant to these agreements  cefs acquired from encana and shell and expanded jointly owned gathering facilities the magnolia gathering system in northwest louisiana 
the magnolia gathering system was initially expanded to gather and treat up to mmcf per day of natural gas 
pursuant to an expansion election made by encana and shell  cefs completed an expansion of the magnolia gathering system in february that increased the aggregate gathering and treating capacity of the system to mmcf per day 
in april  cefs entered into additional long term agreements with an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of encana and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of shell to provide gathering and treating services for their natural gas production from certain haynesville shale and bossier shale formations in texas and louisiana 
pursuant to these agreements  cefs acquired jointly owned gathering facilities the olympia gathering system from encana and shell in northwest louisiana 
under the terms of the agreements  cefs agreed to expand the olympia gathering system in order to permit the system to gather and treat up to mmcf per day of natural gas 
during the fourth quarter of  cefs substantially completed the construction of the olympia gathering system at a cost of approximately million  including the purchase of the original facilities 
cefs is in the second year of the year volume commitment of mmcf per day provided for under the long term agreements 
under the long term agreements  encana and shell may elect to require cefs to expand the capacity of the olympia gathering system by up to an additional mmcf per day  bringing the total system capacity to approximately bcf per day 
cefs estimates that the cost to expand the capacity of the olympia gathering system by an additional mmcf per day would be as much as million 
encana and shell would provide incremental volume commitments in connection with an election to expand the system s capacity 
as of december   the combined contracted capacity of the magnolia and olympia gathering systems was bcf per day 
centerpoint energy mississippi river transmission llc rate settlement proceeding in an effort to avoid the expense of a rate case  centerpoint energy mississippi river transmission  llc mrt initiated a settlement process with its customers 
should these discussions fail  mrt will consider filing for a general rate increase later in mrt will attempt to reach a mutually agreeable rate solution with its customers to recover its increased costs to maintain a safe and reliable system  but there can be no assurance that it will be successful and will avoid the initiation of a rate case 
advanced metering system and distribution grid automation intelligent grid in october  the us department of energy doe selected centerpoint houston for a million grant to help fund its advanced metering system ams and intelligent grid ig projects 
as of december   centerpoint houston had received substantially all of the million of grant funding from the doe 
centerpoint houston has used million of the grant funding to accelerate completion of its deployment of advanced meters to  instead of as originally scheduled 
centerpoint houston estimates that capital expenditures of approximately million for the installation of the advanced meters and corresponding communication and data management systems will be incurred over the advanced meter deployment period  of which approximately million had been spent as of december  centerpoint houston is using the other million from the grant for an initial deployment of an ig in a portion of its service territory 
this initial deployment is expected to be completed in it is expected that the portion of the ig project subject to partial funding by the doe will cost approximately million 
the ig is expected to result in fewer and shorter outages  better customer service  improved operation costs  improved security and more effective use of centerpoint houston s workforce 
in march  the internal revenue service irs announced through the issuance of revenue procedure that it was providing a safe harbor to corporations that receive a smart grid investment grant 
the irs stated that it would not challenge a corporation s treatment of the grant as a non taxable non shareholder contribution to capital as long as the corporation properly reduced the tax basis of specified property 
centerpoint houston rate case as required under the final order in its rate proceeding  in june centerpoint houston filed an application to change rates with the texas utility commission and the cities in its service area 
following hearings in the fall of  the texas utility commission issued its order in may in response to motions filed by several parties  including centerpoint houston  in june  the texas utility commission issued an order on rehearing  which addressed certain errors and inconsistencies identified in its prior decision 
centerpoint houston implemented revised rates on september  based on the order on rehearing 
the order on rehearing has been appealed to the texas courts by various parties  however  a procedural schedule has not been established 
the order on rehearing provides for a base rate increase for centerpoint houston of approximately million per year for delivery charges to the reps and a decrease to charges to wholesale transmission customers of million per year 
further  the order adopts a mechanism to track amounts for uncertain tax positions and provide for ultimate recovery of those costs 
the order authorizes a return on equity for centerpoint houston of  a cost of debt of  a capital structure comprised of debt and common equity  and an overall rate of return of 
the decision also implements centerpoint houston s request to reconcile costs incurred for the ams project and to shorten the period for collecting the ams surcharge from twelve to six years for residential customers in order to reflect the funds received from the doe 
as part of the process to reconcile ams costs  million of the capital investment net of related deferred taxes used to determine the ams surcharge was transferred to centerpoint houston s rate base and used in calculating delivery rates 
as a result of the texas utility commission s order  centerpoint houston anticipates that operating income will be reduced by approximately million compared to performance 
debt financing transactions in january  cerc corp 
issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due with an interest rate of and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due with an interest rate of 
the proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for the repayment of million of cerc corp

financial reform legislation on july   the president signed into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank  which makes substantial changes to regulatory oversight regarding banks and financial institutions 
many provisions of dodd frank will also affect non financial businesses such as those conducted by us and our subsidiaries 
it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impacts this legislation may have on us and our subsidiaries since most of the provisions in the law require extensive rulemaking by various regulatory agencies and authorities  including  among others  the securities and exchange commission sec  the commodities futures trading commission cftc and the new york stock exchange nyse 
nevertheless  in a number of areas  the resulting rules are expected to have direct or indirect impacts on our businesses 
dodd frank provisions will increase required disclosures regarding executive compensation  and rules adopted by the sec in january required advisory votes at our annual meetings by shareholders on executive compensation say on pay and on the frequency that such say on pay votes will be submitted in future years 
new rules adopted by the sec were intended to provide shareholders with access to the director nomination process  but those rules were vacated on procedural grounds by a federal appellate court in response to legal challenges 
although dodd frank includes significant new provisions regarding the regulation of derivatives  the impact of those requirements will not be known definitively until regulations have been adopted by the sec and the cftc 
the sec and certain federal banking agencies are charged with adopting new regulations regarding asset backed securities transactions such as the asset backed securitizations centerpoint houston has sponsored for recovery of transition and storm restoration costs 
the new regulations will include rules to implement the dodd frank requirement that securitization sponsors retain a portion of the credit risk of asset backed securities sold to third parties 
although our securitization of the billion recoverable true up balance was completed while the new risk retention rules were not yet in effect  future securitization transactions may be subject to these rules 
dodd frank also makes substantial changes to the regulatory oversight of the credit rating agencies that are typically engaged to rate our securities and those of our subsidiaries 
it is presently unknown what effect implementation of these new provisions ultimately will have on the activities or costs associated with the credit rating process

future sources and uses of cash our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  tax payments  working capital needs  various regulatory actions and appeals relating to such regulatory actions 
our principal anticipated cash requirements for include the following capital expenditures of approximately billion  scheduled principal payments on transition and system restoration bonds of million  including million for transition bonds issued in january  february purchases of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf which have an aggregate principal amount of million  a required pension contribution of million  the march redemption of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf which have an aggregate principal amount of million  the retirement of long term debt aggregating million  and dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock and interest payments on debt 
we expect that cash on hand  including the approximately billion proceeds from the issuance of transition bonds in january and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs in longer term cash requirements or discretionary financing or refinancing may result in the issuance of equity or debt securities in the capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities

as of december   the liability for uncertain income tax positions was million  of which we expect to settle million in however  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these remaining liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which any such liabilities might be paid 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than the guaranties described below and operating leases  we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
prior to the distribution of our ownership in rri to our shareholders  cerc had guaranteed certain contractual obligations of what became rri s trading subsidiary 
when the companies separated  rri agreed to secure cerc against obligations under the guaranties rri had been unable to extinguish by the time of separation 
pursuant to such agreement  as amended in december  rri now genon agreed to provide to cerc cash or letters of credit as security against cerc s obligations under its remaining guaranties for demand charges under certain gas transportation agreements if and to the extent changes in market conditions expose cerc to a risk of loss on those guaranties based on an annual calculation  with any required collateral to be posted each december 
the undiscounted maximum potential payout of the demand charges under these transportation contracts  which will be in effect until  was approximately million as of december  market conditions in the fourth quarters of and required posting of security under the agreement  and genon posted approximately million in collateral in december and an additional million of collateral in december if genon should fail to perform the contractual obligations  cerc could have to honor its guarantee and  in such event  collateral provided as security may be insufficient to satisfy cerc s obligations

the transition bonds will be repaid over time through a charge imposed on customers in centerpoint houston s service territory 
in february  we purchased million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the mandatory tender provisions of the bonds 
the purchased pollution control bonds will remain outstanding and may be remarketed 
prior to the purchase  the pollution control bonds had fixed interest rates ranging from to 
the purchases reduced temporary investments and leverage while providing us with the flexibility to finance future capital needs in the tax exempt market through the remarketing of these bonds 
additionally  in february  we called for a march redemption of million aggregate principal amount of pollution control bonds issued on our behalf at of their principal amount plus accrued interest pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of the bonds

credit and receivables facilities 
in the third quarter of  the cerc corp

the facility contains a debt excluding transition and system restoration bonds to ebitda covenant as those terms are defined in the facility 
the facility allows for a temporary increase of the permitted ratio in the financial covenant from times to times if centerpoint houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory and we certify to the administrative agent that centerpoint houston has incurred system restoration costs reasonably likely to exceed million in a consecutive twelve month period  all or part of which centerpoint houston intends to seek to recover through securitization financing 
such temporary increase in the financial covenant would be in effect from the date we deliver our certification until the earliest to occur of i the completion of the securitization financing  ii the first anniversary of our certification or iii the revocation of such certification

borrowings under each of the facilities are subject to customary terms and conditions 
however  there is no requirement that the borrower make representations prior to borrowings as to the absence of material adverse changes or litigation that could be expected to have a material adverse effect 
borrowings under each of the credit facilities are subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default that we consider customary 
the facilities also provide for customary fees  including commitment fees  administrative agent fees  fees in respect of letters of credit and other fees 
in each of the three revolving credit facilities  the spread to libor and the commitment fees fluctuate based on the borrower s credit rating 
the borrowers are currently in compliance with the various business and financial covenants in the three revolving credit facilities 
our billion credit facility backstops our billion commercial paper program 
the million cerc corp

temporary investments 
as of february   centerpoint houston had external temporary investments aggregating billion 
money pool 
we have a money pool through which the holding company and participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short term basis 
funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position 
the net funding requirements of the money pool are expected to be met with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or the sale of our commercial paper 
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings 
the interest on borrowings under our credit facilities is based on our credit rating 
as of february   moody s investors service  inc moody s  standard poor s rating services s p  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  and fitch  inc fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries moody s s p fitch company instrument rating outlook rating outlook rating outlook centerpoint energy senior unsecured debt baa stable bbb stable bbb positive centerpoint houston senior secured debt a stable a stable a positive cerc corp 
senior unsecured debt baa stable bbb stable bbb stable a moody s rating outlook is an opinion regarding the likely direction of a rating over the medium term 
an s p rating outlook assesses the potential direction of a long term credit rating over the intermediate to longer term 
a fitch rating outlook encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely ratings direction 
we cannot assure you that the ratings set forth above will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are included for informational purposes and are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies 
a decline in credit ratings could increase borrowing costs under our billion credit facility  centerpoint houston s million credit facility and cerc corp 
s million credit facility 
if our credit ratings or those of centerpoint houston or cerc corp 
had been downgraded one notch by each of the three principal credit rating agencies from the ratings that existed at december   the impact on the borrowing costs under our bank credit facilities would have been immaterial 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and could negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions and to access the commercial paper market 
cerc corp 
and its subsidiaries purchase natural gas from one of their suppliers under supply agreements that contain an aggregate credit threshold of million based on cerc corp 
s s p senior unsecured long term debt rating of bbb 
under these agreements  cerc may need to provide collateral if the aggregate threshold is exceeded 
upgrades and downgrades from this bbb rating will increase and decrease the aggregate credit threshold accordingly 
centerpoint energy services  inc ces  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp 
operating in our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services primarily to commercial and industrial customers and electric and gas utilities throughout the central and eastern united states 
in order to economically hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  ces uses derivatives with provisions standard for the industry  including those pertaining to credit thresholds 
typically  the credit threshold negotiated with each counterparty defines the amount of unsecured credit that such counterparty will extend to ces 
to the extent that the credit exposure that a counterparty has to ces at a particular time does not exceed that credit threshold  ces is not obligated to provide collateral 
mark to market exposure in excess of the credit threshold is routinely collateralized by ces 
as of december   the amount posted as collateral aggregated approximately million million of which is associated with price stabilization activities performed for our natural gas distribution business segment 
should the credit ratings of cerc corp 
as the credit support provider for ces fall below certain levels  ces would be required to provide additional collateral up to the amount of its previously unsecured credit limit 
we estimate that as of december   unsecured credit limits extended to ces by counterparties aggregate million and million of such amount was utilized 
pipeline tariffs and contracts typically provide that if the credit ratings of a shipper or the shipper s guarantor drop below a threshold level  which is generally investment grade ratings from both moody s and s p  cash or other collateral may be demanded from the shipper in an amount equal to the sum of three months charges for pipeline services plus the unrecouped cost of any lateral built for such shipper 
if the credit ratings of cerc corp 
decline below the applicable threshold levels  cerc corp 
might need to provide cash or other collateral of as much as million as of december  the amount of collateral will depend on seasonal variations in transportation levels 
in september  we issued zens having an original principal amount of billion of which million remains outstanding at december  each zens note was originally exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of time warner inc common stock tw common attributable to such note 
the number and identity of the reference shares attributable to each zens note are adjusted for certain corporate events 
as of december   the reference shares for each zens note consisted of share of tw common  share of time warner cable inc common stock twc common and share of aol inc common stock aol common 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens note holders might decide to exchange their zens notes for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the shares of tw common  twc common and aol common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of tw common  twc common and aol common equal to approximately of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens note exchanges result in a cash outflow because tax deferrals related to the zens notes and tw common  twc common and aol common shares would typically cease when zens notes are exchanged or otherwise retired and tw common  twc common and aol common shares are sold 
the ultimate tax liability related to the zens notes continues to increase by the amount of the tax benefit realized each year  and there could be a significant cash outflow when the taxes are paid as a result of the retirement of the zens notes 
if all zens notes had been exchanged for cash on december   deferred taxes of approximately million would have been payable in cross defaults 
under our revolving credit facility  a payment default on  or a non payment default that permits acceleration of  any indebtedness exceeding million by us or any of our significant subsidiaries will cause a default 
in addition  three outstanding series of our senior notes  aggregating million in principal amount as of december   provide that a payment default by us  cerc corp 
or centerpoint houston in respect of  or an acceleration of  borrowed money and certain other specified types of obligations  in the aggregate principal amount of million  will cause a default 
a default by centerpoint energy would not trigger a default under our subsidiaries debt instruments or bank credit facilities 
possible acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures 
from time to time  we consider the acquisition or the disposition of assets or businesses or possible joint ventures or other joint ownership arrangements with respect to assets or businesses 
any determination to take any action in this regard will be based on market conditions and opportunities existing at the time  and accordingly  the timing  size or success of any efforts and the associated potential capital commitments are unpredictable 
we may seek to fund all or part of any such efforts with proceeds from debt and or equity issuances 
debt or equity financing may not  however  be available to us at that time due to a variety of events  including  among others  maintenance of our credit ratings  industry conditions  general economic conditions  market conditions and market perceptions 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by cash collateral requirements that could exist in connection with certain contracts  including our weather hedging arrangements  and gas purchases  gas price and gas storage activities of our natural gas distribution and competitive natural gas sales and services business segments  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts  under certain circumstances  as a result of increased gas prices and concentration of natural gas suppliers  increased costs related to the acquisition of natural gas  increases in interest expense in connection with debt refinancings and borrowings under credit facilities  various legislative or regulatory actions  incremental collateral  if any  that may be required due to regulation of derivatives  the ability of genon and its subsidiaries to satisfy their obligations in respect of genon s indemnity obligations to us and our subsidiaries or in connection with the contractual obligations to a third party pursuant to which cerc is a guarantor  the ability of reps  including rep affiliates of nrg and rep affiliates of energy future holdings corp  which are centerpoint houston s two largest customers  to satisfy their obligations to us and our subsidiaries  delays in cash collections attributable to billing delays  slower customer payments and increased write offs of receivables due to higher gas prices or changing economic conditions  the outcome of litigation brought by and against us  contributions to pension and postretirement benefit plans  restoration costs and revenue losses resulting from future natural disasters such as hurricanes and the timing of recovery of such restoration costs  and various other risks identified in risk factors in item a of this report 
certain contractual limits on our ability to issue securities and borrow money 
centerpoint houston s credit facilities limit centerpoint houston s debt excluding transition and system restoration bonds as a percentage of its total capitalization to 
cerc corp 
s bank facility limits cerc s debt as a percentage of its total capitalization to 
our billion credit facility contains a debt  excluding transition and system restoration bonds  to ebitda covenant which will temporarily increase if centerpoint houston experiences damage from a natural disaster in its service territory that meets certain criteria 
additionally  centerpoint houston has contractually agreed that it will not issue additional first mortgage bonds  subject to certain exceptions 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation accounting guidance for regulated operations provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
our electric transmission distribution business segment  our natural gas distribution business segment and portions of our interstate pipelines business segment apply this accounting guidance 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet as regulatory assets or liabilities and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded when it is probable that these items will be recovered or reflected in future rates 
determining probability requires significant judgment on the part of management and includes  but is not limited to  consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings  proposed regulatory decisions  final regulatory orders and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals 
if events were to occur that would make the recovery of these assets and liabilities no longer probable  we would be required to write off or write down these regulatory assets and liabilities 
at december   we had recorded regulatory assets of billion and regulatory liabilities of billion 
impairment of long lived assets and intangibles we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill as required by accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill was indicated based on our annual analysis at july  unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of long lived assets and intangibles due to changes in estimates of future cash flows  interest rates  regulatory matters and operating costs could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in an impairment charge 
fair value is the amount at which the asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to electricity delivery and natural gas sales and services are generally recognized upon delivery to customers 
however  the determination of deliveries to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  deliveries to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electricity delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
as additional information becomes available  or actual amounts are determinable  the recorded estimates are revised 
consequently  operating results can be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates 
pension and other retirement plans we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
we use several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as estimated by management  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants use subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact to the amount of pension expense recorded 
please read other significant matters pension plans for further discussion 
new accounting pronouncements see note o to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that affect us 
other significant matters pension plans 
as discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions for the qualified plan are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa 
the minimum funding requirements for the qualified pension plan were  and million for  and  respectively 
we made contributions of million  and million in  and for the respective years 
we expect to make a required minimum contribution of million in additionally  we maintain an unfunded non qualified benefit restoration plan that allows participants to receive the benefits to which they would have been entitled under our non contributory pension plan except for the federally mandated limits on qualified plan benefits or on the level of compensation on which qualified plan benefits may be calculated 
employer contributions for the non qualified benefit restoration plan represent benefit payments made to participants and totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension expense in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension expense recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
as the sponsor of a plan  we are required to a recognize on our balance sheet as an asset a plan s over funded status or as a liability such plan s under funded status  b measure a plan s assets and obligations as of the end of our fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of our plans in the year that changes occur through adjustments to other comprehensive income and regulatory assets 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plan assets of our pension plans by million 
changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities held by the plan during could materially  positively or negatively  change our funded status and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions 
pension cost was million  million and million for  and  respectively  of which million  million and million impacted pre tax earnings 
centerpoint houston s actuarially determined pension expense for and in excess of the amount being recovered through rates is being deferred for rate making purposes and was addressed in its rate application pursuant to texas law 
centerpoint houston deferred as a regulatory asset million and million in pension and other postemployment expenses during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   our qualified pension plan had an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which was unchanged from the rate assumed as of december  we believe that our actual asset allocation  on average  will approximate the targeted allocation and the estimated return on net assets 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a decrease from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligations specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension cost for  including the benefit restoration plan  is estimated to be million  of which we expect million to impact pre tax earnings  based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption were lowered by from to  pension cost would increase by approximately million 
as of december   the pension plan projected benefit obligation  including the unfunded benefit restoration plan  exceeded plan assets by million 
if the discount rate were lowered by from to  the assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation and pension expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would impact our consolidated balance sheet by increasing the regulatory asset recorded as of december  by million and would result in a charge to comprehensive income in of million  net of tax 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension plan will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas  natural gas liquids and other energy commodities 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we manage our commodity price risk exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in natural gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding long term debt  bank loans  lease obligations and obligations under our zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
we have no material floating rate obligations 
as of december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
because these instruments are fixed rate  they do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the zens obligation is bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  was a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  did not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  a million recorded liability at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated income and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component liability would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of tw common  million shares of twc common and million shares of aol common  which we hold to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  aggregate market value of these shares would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated income 
commodity price risk from non trading activities we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity price exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in fair value based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
at december   the recorded fair value of our non trading energy derivatives was a net liability of million before collateral 
the net liability consisted of a net liability of million associated with price stabilization activities of our natural gas distribution business segment and a net asset of million related to our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment 
net assets or liabilities related to the price stabilization activities correspond directly with net over under recovered gas cost liabilities or assets on the balance sheet 
an increase of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have increased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives net liability by million 
this increase in net liabilities consists of a million decrease to net liabilities associated with price stabilization activities of our natural gas distribution business segment and a million decrease to net assets related to our competitive natural gas sales and services business segment 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for commodity price risk management purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our non derivative physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above is expected to be substantially offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions
