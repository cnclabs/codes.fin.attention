overview we are one of america s premier coal suppliers  ranked second largest among publicly traded us coal producers as measured by consolidated revenues of billion 
we are the nation s leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal for use in the steel making process and a major supplier of thermal coal to electric utilities and manufacturing industries across the country 
as of december   we operate mines and coal preparation facilities in northern and central appalachia and the powder river basin  with approximately  employees 
we produce  process  and sell steam and metallurgical coal from twelve business units located throughout virginia  west virginia  kentucky  pennsylvania  and wyoming 
we also sell coal produced by others  the majority of which we process and or blend with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  providing us with a higher overall margin for the blended product than if we had sold the coals separately 
our sales of steam coal in  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of metallurgical coal in  and  which generally sells at a premium over steam coal  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
our sales of steam coal during  and were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers throughout the united states  and our sales of metallurgical coal during  and were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states and in several countries in europe  asia and south america 
approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively  were derived from sales made to customers outside the united states  primarily in brazil  india  italy  the netherlands and turkey 
in addition  we generate other revenues from equipment and parts sales and repair  dry systems technologies equipment and filters  road construction  rentals  commissions  coal handling  terminal and processing fees  coal and environmental analysis fees  royalties and the sale of coalbed methane and natural gas 
we also record revenue for freight and handling charges incurred in delivering coal to certain customers  for which we are reimbursed by our customers 
as such  freight and handling revenues are offset by equivalent freight and handling costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
our primary expenses are for operating supply costs  repair and maintenance expenditures  cost of purchased coal  royalties  current wages and benefits  post employment benefits  freight and handling costs  and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
historically  our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale 
we have two reportable segments  eastern coal operations and western coal operations 
eastern coal operations consists of our operations in northern and central appalachia  our coal brokerage activities and our road construction business 
western coal operations 
table of contents consists of two powder river basin mines in wyoming 
our all other category includes an idled underground mine in illinois  expenses associated with certain closed mines  dry systems technologies  revenues and royalties from the sale of coalbed methane and natural gas extraction  equipment sales and repair operations  terminal services  the leasing of mineral rights  general corporate overhead and corporate assets and liabilities 
business developments in addition to the massey acquisition completed on june  and the foundation merger completed on july   recent business developments included the following on february   we announced that subsidiaries in kentucky and west virginia planned to idle four mines immediately and two others between the date of announcement and early  while several other mines altered work schedules or reduced the number of production crews 
altogether ten mining operations are affected  four in eastern kentucky and six in southern west virginia 
the adjustments are expected to reduce coal production by approximately million tons 
the total includes approximately million tons of thermal coal and million tons of lower quality  high volatility metallurgical coal 
coal pricing trends  uncertainties and outlook our long term outlook for the coal markets remains constructive 
coal exports from the us increased from approximately million tons in to approximately million tons in in response to the continued worldwide economic recovery 
export volumes were substantially higher than the historic levels experienced in according to the eia s international energy outlook ieo  global primary energy demand is expected to grow by between and  with coal demand rising most in absolute terms and fossil fuels accounting for most of the increase in demand between now and the ieo estimates that half the growth in world energy consumption will come from india and china 
in total  coal consumption from non oecd countries is expected to grow at an annual rate of  accounting for nearly all the growth in world coal consumption 
the ieo has reached a general conclusion that dependence on coal for power rises strongly in countries with emerging economies and relatively large coal reserves  while it stagnates in the more developed nations and nations with smaller coal reserves 
the energy information administration eia in its annual energy outlook forecasts that coal fired electrical generation will decrease by an average annual rate of through in  the eia estimates that electric power generation from coal decreased by compared to as low natural gas prices  increased environmental pressure  and other factors weigh on coal fired generation 
long term demand for coal and coal based electricity generation in the us will likely be driven by various factors such as the economy  increasing population  increasing demand to power residential electronics and plug in hybrid electric vehicles  public demands for affordable electricity  relative costs for competing fuels for base load generation such as natural gas and nuclear  the inability of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar to become the base load source of electric power  geopolitical risks associated with importing large quantities of global oil and natural gas resources  increasing demand for coal outside the us resulting in increased exports  and the relatively abundant steam coal reserves located within the united states 
as the us and global economies emerge from the recent economic downturn  the international monetary fund s september world economic outlook forecasts us annual gdp to grow and in and  respectively 
although the global economy improved as compared with  many economic indicators continue to point to a slow and uneven recovery 
high unemployment and a weak housing sector in the united states continue to dampen consumer sentiment domestically  while concerns over european sovereign debt issues and the deficit debate in washington  dc  and related downgrade of dc government debt continue to plague financial markets and constrain government spending in certain countries 
ultimately  the global demand for and use of coal may be limited by any global treaties which place restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions 
as part of the united nations framework convention on climate change  representatives from nations  including the us  met in bali  indonesia in december to discuss a program to limit greenhouse gas emissions after the convention adopted the bali road map that detailed a two year process to finalizing a binding agreement in copenhagen in in december participants gathered in copenhagen to develop a framework for climate change mitigation beyond the principal output of the copenhagen summit was the copenhagen accord  a document that is neither legally binding nor voted upon nor signed  but was simply noted by the participating countries 
the ensuing un framework convention on climate change held in cancun in december resulted in an agreement that pushes most of the important decisions to future negotiations 
most recently  at the united nations climate change conference in durbin  members advanced the implementation of previous agreements and agreed to adopt a universal legal agreement on climate change as soon as possible  
table of contents and no later than although the results from these summits were considered modest by many participants  the ultimate outcome of future summits  and any treaty or other arrangement ultimately adopted by the united states or other countries  may have a material adverse impact on the global demand for and supply of coal 
this is particularly true if cost effective technology for the capture and storage of carbon dioxide is not sufficiently developed 
proposed coal fired electric generating facilities that do not include technologies to capture and store carbon dioxide are facing increasing opposition from environmental groups as well as state and local governments  which are concerned with global climate change and uncertain financial impacts of potential greenhouse gas regulations 
coal fired generating plants incorporating carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies will be more expensive to build than conventional pulverized coal generating plants as the technologies are still in the developmental stages 
this dynamic may cause power generating companies to cut back on plans to build coal fired plants in the near term 
nevertheless  the desire to attain us energy independence suggests the construction of new coal fired generating facilities is likely to remain a viable option 
this desire  coupled with heightened interest in coal gasification and coal liquefaction  is a potential indicator of increasing demand for coal in the united states 
based on weekly coal production reporting through december  from the eia  year over year appalachian production increased by approximately due to stable global and domestic demand for metallurgical coal 
compared to  western coal production decreased by approximately in in central appalachia  delays with respect to permits to construct valley fills at surface mines are likely to slow the permitting process for surface mining in that region with resultant uncertainties for producers 
more stringent safety regulations  and increased msha mine inspection activity have also impacted production levels  particularly in central appalachia 
average spot market prices for for central appalachian and northern appalachian coals increased by approximately and  respectively  compared to prices 
average spot market prices for powder river basin coal increased by approximately from the previous year  with the powder river basin offering the least expensive fossil fuel on a dollar per btu basis 
starting in the second half of and continuing into the first quarter of  us and international spot market coal prices have declined due to a combination of slowing economies in the us and europe accompanied by low growth in demand for electricity  increased switching of electricity generation in the us to natural gas due to abundant supply and decade low prices and increases in export volumes from australia as weather driven supply disruptions have eased 
long term  the delicate balance of coal supply and increasing coal demand is expected to result in strong  but potentially volatile  fundamentals for the us coal industry 
the worldwide economic slowdown and the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets seen through much of the past two years continued to ease in  though slow domestic growth and european debt challenges continue to hamper markets 
steel manufacturers reduced production in the latter half of after a very strong start to the year 
we believe that the steel business will continue to show strength in the long term despite normal cyclical volatilities 
however  depressed natural gas prices are placing competitive pressure on steam coal 
a weak economic recovery could slacken demand for metallurgical and steam coals and could negatively influence pricing in the near term 
longer term  coal industry fundamentals remain intact and significant additional growth is expected worldwide 
seaborne coal is expected to grow significantly as developing nations rely heavily on coal for their power needs 
us exports will be needed to help meet the anticipated increase in worldwide coal demand 
we believe these factors should lead to stronger demand for coal  both globally and in the united states  in the coming years 
our results of operations are dependent upon the prices we obtain for our coal as well as our ability to improve productivity and control costs 
principal goods and services we use in our operations include maintenance and repair parts and services  electricity  fuel  roof control and support items  explosives  tires  conveyance structure  ventilation supplies  and lubricants 
our management strives to aggressively control costs and improve operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures 
we have experienced volatility in operating costs related to fuel  explosives  steel  tires  contract services  and healthcare  and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations 
we have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration  for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods  and to support the business units 
the supplier base has been relatively stable for many years  but there has been some consolidation 
we are not dependent on any one supplier in any region 
we promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs 
we seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise 
to the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
employee labor costs have historically increased primarily due to the demands associated with attracting and retaining a workforce  however  recent stability in the marketplace has helped ease this situation 
we may also continue to 
table of contents experience difficult geologic conditions  delays in obtaining permits  labor shortages  unforeseen equipment problems  and shortages of critical materials such as tires and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels

segment analysis the price of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region 
such factors include  but are not limited to coal quality  which includes energy heat content  sulfur  ash  volatile matter and moisture content  transportation costs  regional supply and demand  available competitive fuel sources such as natural gas  nuclear or hydro  and production costs  which vary by mine type  available technology and equipment utilization  productivity  geological conditions  and mine operating expenses 
the energy content or heat value of coal is a significant factor influencing coal prices as higher energy coal is more desirable to consumers and typically commands a higher price in the market 
the heat value of coal is commonly measured in british thermal units or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit 
coal from the eastern and midwest regions of the united states tends to have a higher heat value than coal found in the western united states 
powder river basin coal  with its lower energy content  lower production cost and often greater distance to travel to the consumer  typically sells at a lower price than northern and central appalachian coal that has higher energy content and is often located closer to the end user

the convertible notes were not convertible as of december  and and therefore have been classified as long term debt 
analysis of material debt covenants we were in compliance with all covenants under the new credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes as of december  a breach of the covenants in the new credit agreement or the indentures governing our notes  including the financial covenants under the new credit agreement that measure ratios based on adjusted ebitda  could result in a default under the new credit agreement or the indentures governing our notes and the respective lenders and note holders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any acceleration under either the new credit agreement or one of the indentures governing our notes would also result in a default under the other indentures governing our notes 
additionally  under the new credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
covenants and required levels set forth in the new credit agreement are actual covenant levels  period ended required december  covenant levels minimum adjusted ebitda to cash interest ratio x maximum total debt less unrestricted cash to adjusted ebitda ratio x adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude certain non cash items  non recurring items  and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the new credit agreement 
ebitda  a measure used by management to evaluate its ongoing operations for internal planning and forecasting purposes  is defined as net income loss from operations plus interest expense  income tax expense  amortization of acquired intangibles  net and depreciation  depletion and amortization  less interest income and income tax benefit 
ebitda is not a financial measure recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the amounts shown for ebitda as presented may differ from amounts calculated and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 

table of contents certain non cash items that may adjust ebitda in the compliance calculation are a accretion on asset retirement obligations  b amortization of intangibles  c any long term incentive plan accruals or any non cash compensation expense recorded from grants of stock appreciation or similar rights  stock options or other rights to officers  directors and employees  and d gains or losses associated with the change in fair value of derivative instruments 
certain non recurring items that may adjust ebitda in the compliance calculation are a business optimization expenses or other restructuring charges  b non cash impairment charges  c certain non cash expenses or charges arising as a result of the application of acquisition accounting  d non cash charges associated with loss on early extinguishment of debt  and e charges associated with litigation  arbitration  or contract settlements 
certain other items that may adjust ebitda in the compliance calculation are a after tax gains or losses from discontinued operations  b franchise taxes  and c other non cash expenses that do not represent an accrual or reserve for future cash expense 
the calculation of adjusted ebitda shown below is based on our results of operations in accordance with the facility and therefore  is different from ebitda presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k

these arrangements include guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  the underlying obligations that they secure  such as asset retirement obligations  self insured workers compensation liabilities  royalty obligations and certain retiree medical obligations  are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post mining reclamation required by our mining permits  pay our federal production royalties  pay workers compensation claims under self insured workers compensation laws in various states  pay federal black lung benefits  pay retiree health care benefits to certain retired umwa employees and perform certain other obligations 
in order to provide the required financial assurance  we generally use surety bonds and self bonding for post mining reclamation and bank letters of credit 
table of contents for self insured workers compensation obligations and umwa retiree health care obligations 
federal black lung benefits are paid from a dedicated trust fund to which future contributions will be required 
bank letters of credit are also used to collateralize a portion of the surety bonds 
we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of million as of december  to secure various obligations and commitments 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit in place  of which million was outstanding under the new credit agreement  and million was outstanding under our a r facility 
these outstanding letters of credit served as collateral for workers compensation bonds  reclamation surety bonds  secured umwa retiree health care obligations  secured workers compensation obligations and other miscellaneous obligations 
in the event that additional surety bonds or self bonding capacity become unavailable  we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral 
other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies  and acquisitions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our growth plans and our acquisition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements 
these bids or proposals  which may be binding or nonbinding  are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all

additionally  over the next two years  we plan to establish a million trust fund to fund research and development projects designed to improve mine health and safety 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions  including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require 
illiquid credit markets  volatile equity  foreign currency and energy markets  and declines in demand for steel products have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
we are subject to the risk of price volatility for certain of the materials and supplies used in production  such as diesel fuel and explosives and for the amount we receive for the sale of natural gas 
as a part of our risk management strategy  we enter into options and pay fixed  receive variable and pay variable  receive fixed swap agreements with financial institutions to mitigate the risk of price volatility for both diesel fuel and explosives and sales of natural gas  respectively 
options and swap agreements are derivative instruments that we are required to recognize as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting requirements for derivatives are complex and judgment is required in certain areas such as cash flow hedge accounting and hedge effectiveness testing 
we assess each option or swap agreement to determine whether or not it qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting 
in performing the assessment  we make estimates and assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows related to the forecasted purchases of diesel fuel and explosives and sales of natural gas 
we update our assessments at least on a quarterly basis 
reclamation 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  sealing portals at deep mines and the treatment of water 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates  and assumptions regarding productivity 
we are also faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation  much of which is beyond our control  which could increase our costs and materially increase our asset retirement obligations 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value 
in order to determine fair value  we use assumptions including a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below discount rate 
asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value 
we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
the measurement of an obligation is based upon the amount a third party would demand to assume the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately billion 
coal reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists and reviewed by a third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  
table of contents historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures  as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates 
at december   we had  million tons of proven and probable coal reserves  of which  million tons were assigned to our active operations and  million tons were unassigned 
postretirement medical benefits 
we have long term liabilities for postretirement medical benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
liabilities for postretirement medical benefit costs are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate and future health care cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement medical benefit costs 
the discount rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement medical benefits ranged from to for the various plans for the year ended december  at december   we had total postretirement medical benefit obligations of  million 
the estimated impact of changes to the healthcare cost trend rate and discount rate is as follows health care cost trend rate one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation discount rate one half percentage point increase one half percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation retirement plans 
we have three non contributory defined benefit retirement plans the pension plans covering certain of our salaried and non union hourly employees 
we also have two unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans serps covering certain eligible employees 
benefits are based on either the employee s compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us 
funding of the defined benefit retirement plans is in accordance with the requirements of erisa  which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes 
we contributed million to our defined benefit retirement plans for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded net periodic benefit expense of million for our pension plans and serps and have recorded net obligations of million 
the calculation of the net periodic benefit expense and projected benefit obligation associated with our pension plans and serps requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations 
changes in these assumptions can result in different net periodic benefit expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
we establish the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets 
the pension plans investment targets are equity funds and fixed income funds 
investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis to stay within these targeted guidelines 
the long term rate of return assumption used to determine net periodic benefit expense was for the year ended december  any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods 

table of contents the discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected  accumulated and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense 
in estimating that rate  we use rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rates used to determine pension expense ranged from to for the year ended december  the differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates are amortized into pension expense over the remaining average life of the active plan participants 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost for the year ended december  by less than million and decrease the projected benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would be less than a million increase in the net periodic pension cost and approximately a million increase in the projected benefit obligation 
workers compensation 
workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment 
our obligations are covered through a combination of a self insurance program and third party insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarial studies 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
at december   we had workers compensation obligations of million 
coal workers pneumoconiosis 
we are required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
certain of our subsidiaries are insured for workers compensation and black lung obligations by a third party insurance provider 
certain subsidiaries in west virginia are self insured for workers compensation and state black lung obligations 
certain other subsidiaries are self insured for black lung benefits and fund benefit payments through a section c tax exempt trust fund 
provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by independent actuaries 
in addition  for our subsidiaries in wyoming  we participate in a compulsory state run fund 
charges are made to operations for self insured black lung claims  as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee s applicable term of service 
as of december   we had black lung obligations of million  which are net of assets of million that are held in a tax exempt trust fund 
business combinations 
we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment  the utilization of independent valuation experts and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  market prices and asset lives  among other items 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we analyze both positive and negative evidence 
such evidence includes objective evidence obtained from our historical earnings  future sales commitments  outlooks on the coal industry by us and third parties  expected level of future earnings with sensitivities on expectations considered  timing of temporary difference reversals  ability or inability to meet forecasted earnings  unsettled industry circumstances  ability to utilize net operating losses  available tax planning strategies  limitations on deductibility of temporary differences  and the impact the alternative minimum tax has on utilization of deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is monitored and reviewed quarterly 
if our conclusions change in the future regarding the realization of a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made  which may have a material impact on our results 
as of december   we were in a net deferred tax liability position with tax computed at regular tax rates on the gross temporary differences 
federal tax attributes related to minimum tax credit carry forwards and federal and state net operating losses offset the tax effect of the temporary differences somewhat 
a valuation allowance of million has been provided on certain state net operating losses not expected to provide future tax benefits 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of october of each year 
we test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
we perform our goodwill impairment test in two steps 
step one compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in step one is lower than its carrying value  we proceed to step two  which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
any excess of carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value at a reporting unit is recorded as impairment 

table of contents the valuation methodology utilized in step one to estimate the fair value of the reporting units is based on both a market and income approach and is within the range of fair values yielded under each approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology in which expected future net cash flows are discounted to present value  using an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of capital discount rate 
the market approach is based on a guideline company and similar transaction methodology 
under the guideline company approach  certain operating metrics from a selected group of publically traded guideline companies that have similar operations to the company s reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
under the similar transaction approach  recent merger and acquisition transactions for companies that have similar operations to the company s reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the company s reporting units 
the income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including  sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  income taxes  capital spending  working capital changes and the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long term outlook of market prices expected to be received for our coal 
if actual coal prices are less than our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units 
our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts and an assumed inflation rate for materials and supplies such as steel  diesel fuel and explosives 
if actual costs are higher or if inflation increases above our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units 
we also are faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation  much of which is beyond our control  which could increase our costs and materially decrease the fair value of our reporting units 
in step two of the goodwill impairment test  we compared the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill at a reporting unit  we assigned the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of october  and recorded impairment charges of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value of million for four of our reporting units in eastern coal operations 
the fair values of two of our reporting units in eastern coal operations and our single reporting unit in western coal operations exceeded their carrying values by  and  respectively  and the carrying value of goodwill at those reporting units as of december  was million  million  and million  respectively 
a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would impact the fair values of these reporting units by approximately million  or  and a increase or decrease in the estimated operating margin would impact the fair values of these reporting units by approximately million  or 
the fair values of our other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a total of billion  or

the range of changes reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
we have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel  steel and other items such as explosives 
we manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivative instruments from time to time  primarily swap contracts with financial institutions  for a certain percentage of our monthly requirements 
swap agreements essentially fix the price paid for our diesel fuel and explosives by requiring us to pay a fixed price and receive a floating price 
we expect to use approximately  tons of explosives in through our derivative swap contracts  we have fixed prices for approximately of our expected explosive needs in if the price of natural gas were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our natural gas derivatives would increase  which would be largely offset by a decrease in the cost of our physical explosive purchases 
we expect to use approximately million gallons and million gallons of diesel fuel in and  respectively 
through our derivative swap contracts  we have fixed prices for approximately and of our expected diesel fuel needs for and  respectively 
if the price of diesel fuel were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our diesel fuel derivative swap contracts would increase  which would be offset by a decrease in the cost of our physical diesel fuel purchases 
we also sell coalbed methane through our coal gas recovery business 
the revenues derived from the sale of coalbed methane are subject to volatility based on the changes in natural gas prices 
in order to reduce that risk  we enter into pay variable  receive fixed natural gas swaps for a portion of our anticipated gas production in order to fix the selling price for a portion of our production 
the natural gas swaps have been designated as qualifying cash flow hedges 
as of december   we had swap agreements outstanding to hedge the variable cash flows related to approximately and of anticipated natural gas production in and  respectively 
credit risk our credit risk is primarily with electric power generators and steel producers 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable against established credit limits 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay 
interest rate risk our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
as we continue to monitor the interest rate environment in concert with our risk mitigation objectives  consideration is being given to future interest rate risk reduction strategies 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates through our new credit agreement  which has a variable interest rate of percentage points over the libo rate  subject  in the case of the revolving credit line  to adjustment based on leverage ratios 
as of december   our term loan due under the new credit agreement had an outstanding balance of million  net of debt discount of million 
the current portion of the term loan due in the next twelve months was million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense by million  which would be partially offset by our interest rate swap 
to achieve risk mitigation objectives  we have in the past managed our interest rate exposure through the use of interest rate swaps 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates  effective may  we entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk that changing interest rates could have on our operations 
the swap initially qualified for cash flow hedge accounting and changes in fair value were recorded as a component of equity  however  the underlying debt instrument was subsequently paid in and the swap no longer qualified for cash flow hedge accounting 
the amounts that were previously recorded in equity of million  net of tax  were recognized in our consolidated statements of operations in subsequent changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings 
if interest rates were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our interest rate swap would increase  which would be partially offset by a decrease in the amount of actual interest paid on our facility
