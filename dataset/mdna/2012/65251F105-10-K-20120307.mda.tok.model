item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
important factors that may cause actual results and circumstances to differ materially from those described in such statements is contained below and in item a 
risk factors of this report 
overview we are a specialized commercial finance company focused on meeting the complex financing needs of companies and private investors in the middle market 
we focus primarily on the direct origination of bank loans and equipment leases through teams of credit trained bankers and marketing officers organized around key industry and market segments 
our marketing and direct origination efforts target private equity sponsors  mid sized companies  corporate executives  regional banks  real estate investors and a variety of other referral sources and financial intermediaries to source new customer relationships and lending opportunities 
our emphasis on direct origination is an important aspect of our marketing and credit strategy because it provides us with direct access to our customers management teams and enhances our ability to conduct detailed due diligence and credit analysis of prospective borrowers 
it also allows us to negotiate transaction terms directly with borrowers and  as a result  we have significant input into our customers financial strategies and capital structures 
from time to time  we also participate in loans as a member of a lending group 
we employ highly experienced bankers  marketing officers and credit professionals to identify and structure new lending opportunities and manage customer relationships 
we believe that the quality of our professionals  the breadth of their relationships and referral networks  and their ability to develop creative solutions for customers position us to be a valued partner and preferred lender for mid sized companies 
we operate as a single segment  and we derive revenues from four specialized lending groups that target market segments in which we believe that we have a competitive advantage leveraged finance  provides senior  secured cash flow loans and  to a lesser extent  second lien  and subordinated debt  and equity or other equity linked products  which are primarily used to finance acquisitions of mid sized companies with annual cash flow ebitda typically between million and million by private equity investment funds managed by established professional alternative asset managers  real estate  provides first mortgage debt and  to a lesser extent  subordinated debt  primarily to finance acquisitions of commercial real estate properties typically valued between million and million by professional commercial real estate investors  business credit  provides senior  secured asset based loans primarily to fund working capital needs of mid sized companies with sales typically totaling between million and million  and equipment finance  provides leases  loans and lease lines to finance equipment purchases and other capital expenditures typically for companies with annual sales of at least million 
market conditions as a specialized commercial finance company  we compete in various segments of the loan market to extend credit to mid sized companies through our four national specialized lending platforms 
we also rely  to some extent  on the capital markets for funding through the issuance of asset backed notes 
overall  conditions in targeted segments of the loan markets improved in the fourth quarter of as pricing remained attractive and loan demand increased 
an improving macro economic environment  lower unemployment and more certainty about the potential impact of the eurozone debt crisis created a more constructive environment for acquisitions and private investment activity 
after significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets through the third quarter  conditions improved in the fourth quarter with gains in debt and equity new issuance volumes  including asset backed securities 

table of contents we continued to originate new loans with attractive credit spreads and yields in the fourth quarter  which compared favorably to historical averages for comparably rated loans 
pricing and credit parameters in our target markets in the fourth quarter also compared favorably to the broader loan market  in which larger corporations typically borrow from syndicates of banks and loans are issued  priced and traded in a bond style market that is more highly correlated with the high yield debt market 
after a relatively weak third quarter  loan demand began to rebound modestly in september and continued to improve through the fourth quarter 
we originated new funded loans totaling million in the fourth quarter  which is the highest level of origination since loan demand in the middle market is strongly influenced by the level of refinancing  acquisition activity and private investment  which is driven largely by changes in the perceived risk environment  prevailing borrowing rates and private investment activity 
overall activity increased in the fourth quarter due to a combination of seasonal factors and improvements in sentiment as macro economic activity increased  unemployment declined and euro zone risks appeared to abate 
we continue to believe demand for new middle market loans and credit products will continue to increase because substantial amounts of debt are nearing maturity and will need to be refinanced  and private equity firms have substantial un invested capital  which we believe that they will deploy according to investment strategies that emphasize investments in mid sized companies 
we also continue to believe that a significant and lasting impact of the credit crisis that began in has been a reduction in the number and capacity of lenders in the markets in which we compete 
as a result of these factors  we anticipate that demand for loans and credit products offered by the company and conditions in our lending markets will remain favorable for an extended period of time 
recent developments liquidity on february   we entered into a million revolving credit facility with natixis which matures on february  on january   we entered in to an amendment to our credit facility with fortress credit corp 
which increased the size of the facility from million to million and extended the maturity date to august  on november   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility with wells fargo  national association which increased the amount of the facility from million to million 
on october   we received notice from natixis that natixis elected to extend the revolving period under the credit facility to may   the latest date that natixis was permitted to extend the facility under our agreement with natixis 
stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the timing and amount of any shares purchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors and required use of cash 
the repurchase program  which will expire on september  unless extended by the board of directors  may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice 
as of december   the company had not repurchased any of its common stock under this plan

efficiency ratio our efficiency ratio  which is total operating expenses divided by net interest income before provision for credit losses plus total non interest income  was for  for and for the increase in our efficiency ratio during as compared to was primarily due to lower non interest income and higher operating expenses  partially offset by higher net interest income during the increase in our efficiency ratio during as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in net interest income during  partially offset by an increase in non interest income as a result of the gain on acquisition 
allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses ratio  which is allowance for credit losses divided by outstanding gross loans and leases excluding loans held for sale  was at december   as of december  and as of december  the decrease in the allowance for credit losses ratio is primarily due to a decrease in the balance of the specific allowance for credit losses  and slowing negative credit migration and improving economic conditions 
at december   the specific allowance for credit losses was million  and the general allowance for credit losses was million 
at december   the specific allowance for credit losses was million  and the general allowance for credit losses was million 
we continually evaluate our allowance for credit losses methodology 
if we determine that a change in our allowance for credit losses methodology is advisable  as a result of the rapidly changing economic environment or otherwise  the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance 
moreover  actual losses under our current or any revised methodology may differ materially from our estimate 
delinquent loan rate delinquent loan rate  which is total delinquent loans that are days or more past due  divided by outstanding gross loans and leases  was as of december  as compared to as of december  we expect the delinquent loan rate to remain elevated if economic conditions continue to negatively impact the financial performance of certain borrowers and their ability to meet their obligations on a timely basis 

table of contents delinquent loan rate for accruing loans days or more past due delinquent loan rate for accruing loans days or more past due  which is total delinquent accruing loans net of charge offs that are days or more past due and less than days past due  divided by outstanding gross loans and leases  was as of december  as compared to as of december  we expect the delinquent accruing loan rate to increase if economic conditions continue to negatively impact the financial performance of certain borrowers and their ability to meet their obligations on a timely basis 
non accrual loan rate non accrual loan rate is defined as total balances outstanding of loans on non accrual status divided by the total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment 
loans are put on non accrual status if they are days or more past due or if management believes it is probable that the company will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business 
the non accrual loan rate was as of december  and as of december  as of december  and  the aggregate outstanding balance of non accrual loans was million and million  respectively and total outstanding loans held for investment were billion and billion  respectively 
we expect the non accrual loan rate to remain elevated if economic conditions continue to impair certain borrowers ability to fully repay principal and interest under the terms of their loan agreement 
non performing asset rate non performing asset rate is defined as the sum of total balances outstanding of loans on non accrual status and other real estate owned  divided by the sum of the total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment and other real estate owned 
the non performing asset rate was as of december  and as of december  as of december  and the sum of the aggregate outstanding value of non performing assets was million and million  respectively 
we expect the non performing asset rate to remain elevated if economic conditions continue to impair certain borrowers ability to fully repay principal and interest under the terms of their loan agreements 
net charge off rate end of period loans and leases net charge off rate as a percentage of end of period loan and lease portfolio is defined as annualized charge offs net of recoveries divided by the total outstanding balance of our loans and leases held for investment 
a charge off occurs when management believes that all or part of the principal of a particular loan is no longer recoverable and will not be repaid

interest income increased million  to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to an increase in the yield on average interest earning assets to from  primarily driven by an increase in contractual interest rates from new loan origination and re pricings subsequent to december  and the decrease in the average balance of our interest earning assets 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities and a decrease in accelerated amortization of certain deferred financing fees 
during  we called our clo which resulted in the accelerated amortization of the associated unamortized discount and deferred financing fees totaling million 
during  we accelerated the amortization of million of deferred financing fees resulted from the repayment of our deutsche bank term debt facility and the reduction of the commitment amount under our credit facility with citicorp 

table of contents net interest margin 
net interest margin increased to for from for the increase in net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in our average yield on interest earning assets from new loan origination and re pricings subsequent to december   partially offset by a slight increase in average cost of funds 
the slight increase in average cost of funds is primarily due to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing fees and unamortized discount related to our clo and the decrease in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by the accelerated amortization of million of deferred financing fees during resulting from the repayment of our deutsche bank term debt facility and the reduction of the commitment amount under our credit facility with citicorp 
the net interest spread  the difference between gross yield on our interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities  increased to from 
the following table summarizes the yield and cost of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for and year ended december  year ended december  in thousands average balance interest income expense average yield cost average balance interest income expense average yield cost total interest earning assets total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread net interest margin provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses decreased to million for from million for the decrease in the provision was primarily due to a decrease of million of specific provisions recorded during as compared to during  we recorded specific provisions of million compared to million recorded during the decrease in the specific component of the provision for credit losses was primarily due to lower outstanding loan balances since december  of impaired loans with a specific allowance  slowing negative credit migration  and improving economic conditions 
our general allowance for credit losses covers probable losses in our loan and lease portfolio with respect to loans and leases for which no specific impairment has been identified 
a specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to loans for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized 
impaired loans  which include all of our delinquent loans and troubled debt restructurings  as a percentage of loans and leases  net decreased to as of december  as compared to as of december  when a loan is classified as impaired  the loan is evaluated for a specific allowance and a specific provision may be recorded  thereby removing it from consideration under the general component of the allowance analysis 
consequently  as the percentage of impaired loans in our loan portfolio decreased as compared to december   the percentage of loans in our loan portfolio being evaluated under our general allowance analysis has increased 
a general allowance is provided for loans and leases that are not impaired 
the company employs a variety of internally developed and third party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk  which are used in developing an allowance for loan and lease losses on outstanding loans and leases 
the company s allowance framework addresses economic conditions  capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top down and bottom up perspective 
the company considers and evaluates changes in economic conditions  credit availability  industry and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on at least a quarterly basis  loans and leases are internally risk rated based on individual credit criteria  including loan and lease type  loan and lease structures including balloon and bullet structures common in the 
table of contents company s leveraged finance and real estate cash flow loans  borrower industry  payment capacity  location and quality of collateral if any including the company s real estate loans 
borrowers provide the company with financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis 
ratings  corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition or profile 
for leveraged finance loans  the data set used to construct probabilities of default in its allowance for loan losses model  moody s crd private firm database  primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar to the company s loans 
the company also considers the quality of the loan terms in determining a loan loss in the event of default 
for real estate loans  the company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions 
first  a loan s risk rating  and thereby its assumed default likelihood  can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions 
second  to the extent that economic or industry trends adversely affect a substandard rated borrower s loan to value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability  the company applies a stress multiplier to the loan s probability of default 
the multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline 
the company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic and capital market conditions 
in response to deteriorating commercial real estate market conditions during  the company adjusted its allowance for credit losses methodology regarding commercial real estate loans to reflect lack of liquidity in commercial real estate debt and equity capital markets  lack of transaction activity to provide visibility of underlying asset values  and a general decline in property values that had increased the probability of default for borrowers with high loan to value ratios 
the principal modification made during included the introduction of a stress multiplier to the allowance for loan losses methodology  which was designed to capture default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause underlying commercial real estate values to decline 
the stress multiplier is based on the expectation that a loan s default rate will increase as the loan to value ratio increases 
the company reviewed its commercial real estate loan portfolio  and applied the stress multiplier to all commercial real estate loans where the borrower s loan to value ratio exceeded a specific threshold 
the stress multiplier was tiered and stepped up in specified increments as the loan to value ratio increased 
during  the company recognized the need to adjust this methodology to reflect more stable macroeconomic conditions  improvements in capital market liquidity  greater visibility on the economy and underlying asset values  as well as evidence of property price stabilization 
the company refined its approach for commercial real estate loans at this time primarily through three updates to the existing framework 
first  it calibrated the stress multipliers across all loan to value tiers to reflect increased depth in the financing markets compared to what was available in second  the category of credits on which the stress multipliers were applied was changed to credits with a weaker risk profile in addition to loan to value ratios in excess of the specified threshold  which remained unchanged 
last  estimates of loss upon a default were amended to reflect the results of an updated internal loss and recovery analysis 
the impact of these modifications was a decrease in the commercial real estate allowance for loan losses of approximately basis points 
if the company determines that additional changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable  as a result of changes in the economic environment or otherwise  the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance 
moreover  given uncertain market conditions  actual losses under the company s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ materially from the company s estimate 

table of contents additionally  when determining the amount of the general allowance  the company supplements the base amount with a judgmental amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of ten individually weighted risk factors 
the risk factors are designed based on those outlined in the comptrollers of the currency s allowance for loan and lease losses handbook 
the company also performs a ratio analysis of comparable money center banks  regional banks and finance companies 
while the company does not rely on this peer group comparison to set the level of allowance for credit losses  it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the allowance for credit losses computation 
during  we reduced our general allowance for credit losses to reflect improving performance in our non impaired loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment of a loan is based upon i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy 
impaired loans are identified based on the loan by loan risk rating process described above 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans  loans with partial charge offs and loans which are troubled debt restructurings 
it is the company s policy during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans for which we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
impaired loans at december  were in real estate  leveraged finance  and business credit over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment including the following buildings and commercial real estate  broadcast and entertainment  nondurable consumer products  energy and chemical services  financial services  healthcare  printing and publishing  restaurants  and industrial and other business services 
for impaired leveraged finance loans  the company measured impairment based on expected cash flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability 
such amounts are discounted based on original loan terms 
for impaired real estate loans  the company determined that the loans were collateral dependent and measured impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third party appraisers  as well as internal estimates of market value 
non interest income 
non interest income decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease is primarily due to a million loss on the value of equity interests in certain impaired borrowers  a million net loss on equity method of accounting interests  a million decrease in the gain recognized in connection with the repurchase of debt  and the million gain on acquisition during as a result of certain of our troubled debt restructurings  we have received an equity interest in several of our impaired borrowers 
the equity interest in certain impaired borrowers is initially recorded at fair value when the debt is restructured and is subsequently analyzed at the end of each quarter 
in situations where we are deemed to be under the equity method of accounting  we record our ownership share of the borrowers results of operations in non interest income 
additionally  our corresponding share of our borrowers results of operations may directly impact the remaining net book value of these respective loans 
these equity interests may give rise to potential capital gains or losses  for tax purposes 
this could impact future period tax rates depending on our ability to recognize capital losses to the extent of any capital gains 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  to million for from million for primarily due to the acquisition of business credit in november employee compensation and benefits increased million primarily due to higher headcount and an increase in the non cash compensation charge related to equity award grants 
income taxes 
for and  we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of for both years 
the effective tax rate for and included the impact of a valuation allowance recorded during and its reversal during 
table of contents as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining the realizability of deferred tax assets at december  we considered carryback availability  the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income during the reversal periods  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we also considered our recent history of taxable income  trends in our earnings and tax rate  positive financial ratios  and the impact of the downturn in the current economic environment including the impact of credit on allowance and provision for loan losses  and the impact on funding levels on the company 
based upon our assessment  we believe that a valuation allowance was not necessary as of december  as of december   our deferred tax asset was primarily comprised of million related to our allowance for credit losses and million related to equity compensation 
comparison of the years ended december  and interest income 
interest income decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets to from  primarily driven by the decrease in the average balance of our interest earning assets  and a decrease in three month libor 
average three month libor decreased from for to for interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  to million for from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by the accelerated amortization of certain deferred financing fees and an increase in our cost of borrowings 
the decrease in the average balance of our interest bearing liabilities is primarily attributable to the reduction of total debt from billion as of december  to billion as of december  during  we accelerated the amortization of million of deferred financing fees resulted from the repayment of our deutsche bank term debt facility and the reduction of the commitment amount under our credit facility with citicorp 
the increase in our cost of borrowings  to from  was primarily attributable to the higher cost of borrowings associated with the recent amendments to our credit facilities and the term debt securitization that we completed in january net interest margin 
net interest margin decreased to for from for the decrease in net interest margin was primarily due to an increase in our average cost of interest bearing liabilities  a decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets  and non payment of interest income from non accrual loans  partially offset by an increase in interest yields on new loan originations and re pricings subsequent to december  the increase in average cost of funds is primarily due to the accelerated amortization of million of deferred financing fees resulting from the repayment of our deutsche bank term debt facility and the reduction of the commitment amount under our credit facility with citicorp  and the higher cost of funds from our new term debt securitization and new revolving note credit facility with fortress both completed in january 
the decrease in yield is primarily due to a decrease in three month libor 
the net interest spread  the difference between gross yield on our interest earning assets and the total cost of our interest bearing liabilities  decreased to from 
the decline in libor negatively impacted the net interest margin  which was more than offset by libor floor provisions included in certain of our customer contracts 
at december   of our adjustable rate loans included interest rate floors 
non accrual loans negatively impacted the net interest margin by  which was offset by an increase in interest spreads of

the provision for credit losses decreased to million for from million for the decrease in the provision was primarily due to a decrease of million of specific provisions and a decrease of million of general provisions recorded during as compared to during  we recorded specific provisions of million compared to million recorded during the decrease in the specific component of the provision for credit losses was principally due to lower outstanding balance of impaired loans during  slowing negative credit migration  and improving economic conditions 
the decrease in the general component of the provision for credit losses was principally due to the million decrease in total loans net as compared to december  our general allowance for credit losses covers probable losses in our loan portfolio with respect to loans for which no specific impairment has been identified 
a specific provision for credit losses is recorded with respect to loans for which it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement for which there is impairment recognized 
impaired loans  which include all of our delinquent loans and troubled debt restructurings  as a percentage of loans  net increased to as of december  as compared to as of december  when a loan is classified as impaired  the loan is evaluated for a specific allowance and a specific provision may be recorded  thereby removing it from consideration under the general component of the allowance analysis 
consequently  as the percentage of impaired loans in our loan portfolio increased as compared to december   the percentage of loans in our loan portfolio being evaluated under our general allowance analysis has decreased 
non interest income 
non interest income increased million  to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to a gain of million recognized in connection with the acquisition of core  a million improvement in impairment of other real estate owned  and a million improvement in equity instrument impairments  partially offset by a million gain recognized in in connection with the sale of an equity instrument 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million  to million for from million for general and administrative expenses decreased million due primarily to decrease in potential acquisition costs 
occupancy and equipment expenses decreased million primarily due to less office space 
income taxes 
for and  we provided for income taxes based on an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for and reflects the impact of nondeductible compensation expenses incurred in connection with our initial public offering and the impact of a related discrete item resulting from vesting events in 
table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity consist of cash flow from operations  credit facilities  term debt securitizations and proceeds from equity and debt offerings 
in  we renewed a warehouse credit facility on more favorable terms and amended a corporate debt facility to increase the size of the commitment and establish better pricing and advance rates among other improved terms 
in the second quarter of  we closed on a five year master repurchase facility to finance a portion of our commercial real estate portfolio and repaid in full our credit facility with citicorp 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an amendment with wells fargo to its credit facility that increased its size to million  which was subsequently increased to million during the fourth quarter of  and provided for a revolving reinvestment period of months with a two year amortization period from the amendment date 
also during the third quarter we extended the revolving period under our credit facility with natixis to october  and subsequently extended it to may  we also called our clo during the third quarter of additionally  in january we amended our facility with fortress to increase the size of the facility to million and extended the maturity date to august  we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund our current operations  lending activities and other short term liquidity needs 
we continue to explore  subject to market conditions  opportunities for the company to increase its leverage  including through the issuance of high yield debt securities  convertible debt securities  secured or unsecured senior debt or a revolving credit facility  to support portfolio growth and strategic acquisitions  which may be material to us 
in addition to opportunistic funding related to potential growth initiatives  our future liquidity needs will be determined primarily based on the credit performance of our loan portfolio and origination volume 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future based on various factors that include faster than expected increases in the level of non accrual loans  lower than anticipated recoveries or cash flow from operations  and unexpected limitations on our ability to fund certain loans with credit facilities 
we may not be able to raise debt or equity capital on acceptable terms or at all 
the incurrence of additional debt will increase our leverage and interest expense  and the issuance of any equity or securities exercisable  convertible or exchangeable into company common stock may be dilutive for existing shareholders 
despite a strengthening us economy  conditions in the global capital markets remained unsettled during most of the fourth quarter of primarily due to the european financial crisis 
notwithstanding this volatility  the larger  more liquid segments of the securitization markets continued their recovery  supporting new issuances of securities backed by mortgages  credit cards  equipment and auto loans 
with continued liquidity in these asset classes and otherwise normalized market conditions  the securitization markets for other asset types  including clos  have also recovered to a point that we believe they provide a reliable source of capital for companies like newstar 
conditions in the securitization market for bank loans  which the company partially relies upon for funding  have remained open as default rates have declined  despite weakness in loan market pricing in the fourth quarter and the capital market volatility noted above 
the pace of recovery in the securitization market for bank loans slowed through much of the fourth quarter  but has picked up in last few weeks 
we expect the broader favorable trends to continue as treasury and investment grade bond rates remain at all time lows and investors focus on higher yielding  floating rate asset classes in order to achieve yield 
the past two months have also shown renewed stability in debt and equity capital markets and with it  strengthening of the high yield bond and loan markets as well as the clo market 
in addition to these signs of improving market conditions  we believe the company has substantially greater financial flexibility and increased financing options due to the improvement in our financial performance 
we believe that our ability to access new credit facilities and renew and amend our existing credit facilities reflects an overall improvement in the market conditions for funding and continues to indicate progress in our ability to obtain financings on improved terms in the future 
despite these signs of improving market conditions  we cannot assure you that this will continue  and it is possible that market conditions could become more uncertain or worsen 
if they do  we could face materially higher financing costs  which would affect our operating strategy and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in cash and cash equivalents 
we may invest a portion of cash on hand in short term liquid investments 
from time to time  we may use a portion of our non restricted cash to pay down our credit facilities 
during the second quarter of  we fully repaid our credit facility with citibank  na restricted cash separately  we had million and million of restricted cash as of december  and  respectively 
the restricted cash represents the balance of the principal and interest collections accounts and pre funding amounts in our credit facilities  our term debt securitizations and customer holdbacks and escrows 
the use of the principal collection accounts cash is limited to funding the growth of our loan and portfolio within the facilities or paying down related credit facilities or term debt securitizations 
as of december   we could use million of restricted cash to fund new or existing loans 
the interest collection account cash is limited to the payment of interest  servicing fees and other expenses of our credit facilities and term debt securitizations and  if either a ratings downgrade or failure to receive ratings confirmation occurs on the rated notes in a term debt securitization at the end of the funding period or if coverage ratios are not met  paying down principal with respect thereto 
cash to fund the growth of our loan portfolio and to pay interest on our term debt securitizations represented a large portion of our restricted cash balance at december  asset quality and allowance for loan and lease losses if a loan is days or more past due  or if management believes it is probable we will unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business  it is our policy to place the loan on non accrual status 
if a loan financed by a term debt securitization is placed on non accrual status  the loan may remain in the term debt securitization and excess interest spread cash distributions to us will cease until cash accumulated in the term debt securitization equals the outstanding balance of the non accrual loan 
when a loan is on non accrual status  accrued interest previously recognized as interest income subsequent to the last cash receipt in the current year will be reversed  and the recognition of interest income on that loan will stop until factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the loan has been brought current 
we may make exceptions to this policy if the loan is well secured and is in the process of collection

it is the company s policy that during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans which we have identified impairments 
subsequently  we may charge off the portion of the loan for which a specific provision was recorded

the actual timing of payments will ultimately vary from the above data due to future fundings and repayments we expect to occur 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we maintain an overall risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
our operations are subject to risks resulting from interest rate fluctuations on our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
we seek to provide maximum levels of net interest income  while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk 
as such  we enter into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to hedge interest rate exposure to interest rate fluctuations on floating rate funding agreement liabilities that are matched with fixed rate securities 
under the interest rate swap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount 
we record the exchanged amount in net interest income in our statements of operations 
under the interest rate cap contracts  we agree to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between a specified fixed interest the cap and floating interest amounts calculated on an agreed upon notional principal amount  but only if the floating interest rate exceeds the cap rate 
the interest rate caps currently are not matched to specific assets or liabilities and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
interest rate risk mitigation products are offered to enable customers to meet their financing and risk management objectives 
derivative financial instruments consist predominantly of interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors 
the interest rate risks to the company of these customer derivatives is mitigated by entering into similar derivatives having offsetting terms with other counterparties consisting primarily of large financial institutions 
the interest rate mitigation products do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges  including any cash payments made or received  are reported as gain or loss on derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we are party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our borrowers 
these financial instruments include unfunded commitments  standby letters of credit and interest rate mitigation products 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement we have in particular classes of financial instruments 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
unused lines of credit are commitments to lend to a borrower if certain conditions have been met 
these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because certain commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
we evaluate each borrower s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral required is based on factors that include management s credit evaluation of the borrower and the borrower s compliance with financial covenants 
due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts that will be required to fund our unfunded commitments 
the aggregate amount of these unfunded commitments currently exceeds our available funds and will likely continue to exceed our available funds in the future 
at december   we had million of unused lines of credit 
of these unused lines of credit  unfunded commitments related to revolving credit facilities were million and unfunded commitments related to delayed draw term loans were million 
million of the unused commitments are unavailable to the borrowers  which may be related to the borrowers inability to meet covenant obligations or other similar events 
revolving credit facilities allow our borrowers to draw up to a specified amount  subject to customary borrowing conditions 
the unfunded revolving commitments of million are further categorized as either contingent or unrestricted 
contingent commitments limit a borrower s ability to access the revolver unless it meets an enumerated borrowing base covenant or other restrictions 
at december   we categorized million of the unfunded commitments related to revolving credit facilities as contingent 
unrestricted commitments represent commitments that are currently accessible  assuming the borrower is in compliance with certain customary loan terms and conditions 
at december   we had million of unfunded unrestricted revolving commitments 
during the three months ended december   revolver usage averaged approximately  which is line with the average of over the previous four quarters 
management s experience indicates that borrowers typically do not seek to exercise their entire available line of credit at any point in time 
during the three months and year ended december   revolving commitments decreased million and million  respectively 
delayed draw credit facilities allow our borrowers to draw predefined amounts of the approved loan commitment at contractually set times  subject to specific conditions  such as capital expenditures in corporate loans or for tenant improvements in commercial real estate loans 
during the three months and year ended december   delayed draw credit facility commitments increased million and million  respectively 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance by a borrower to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending credit to our borrowers 
at december  we had million of standby letters of credit

at december   the notional value of the interest rate mitigation products was critical accounting policies accounting policies involving significant estimates and assumptions by management  which have  or could have  a material impact on our financial statements  are considered critical accounting policies 
the following are our critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is based on a loan by loan build up of inherent losses on loans  gross 
we also maintain an allowance for losses on unfunded loan commitments  namely loan commitments and letters of credit that are reported in other liabilities on the balance sheet 
the combined balance of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded commitments is referred to as the allowance for credit losses 
as of december   we had an allowance for credit losses of million  with specific allowances totaling million 
a general allowance is provided for loans and leases that are not impaired 
the company employs a variety of internally developed and third party modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk  which are used in developing an allowance for loan and lease losses on outstanding loans and leases 
the company s allowance framework addresses economic conditions  capital market liquidity and industry circumstances from both a top down and bottom up perspective 
the company considers and evaluates changes in economic conditions  credit availability  industry and multiple obligor concentrations in assessing both probabilities of default and loss severities as part of the general component of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
on at least a quarterly basis  loans and leases are internally risk rated based on individual credit criteria  including loan and lease type  loan and lease structures including balloon and bullet structures common in the company s leveraged finance and real estate cash flow loans  borrower industry  payment capacity  location and quality of collateral if any including the company s real estate loans 
borrowers provide the company with financial information on either a monthly or quarterly basis 
ratings  corresponding assumed default rates and assumed loss severities are dynamically updated to reflect any changes in borrower condition or profile 
for leveraged finance loans  the data set used to construct probabilities of default in its allowance for loan losses model  moody s crd private firm database  primarily contains middle market loans that share attributes similar to the company s loans 
the company also considers the quality of the loan terms in determining a loan loss in the event of default 
for real estate loans  the company employs two mechanisms to capture the impact of industry and economic conditions 
first  a loan s risk rating  and thereby its assumed default likelihood  can be adjusted to account for overall commercial real estate market conditions 
second  to the extent that economic or industry trends adversely affect a substandard rated borrower s loan to value ratio enough to impact its repayment ability  the company applies a stress multiplier to the loan s probability of default 
the multiplier is designed to account for default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause commercial real estate prices to decline 
the company periodically reviews its allowance for credit loss methodology to assess any necessary adjustments based upon changing economic and capital market conditions 
in response to deteriorating commercial real estate market conditions during  the company adjusted its allowance for credit losses methodology regarding commercial real estate loans to reflect lack of liquidity in commercial real estate debt and equity capital markets  
table of contents lack of transaction activity to provide visibility of underlying asset values  and a general decline in property values that had increased the probability of default for borrowers with high loan to value ratios 
the principal modification made during included the introduction of a stress multiplier to the allowance for loan losses methodology  which was designed to capture default characteristics that are difficult to quantify when market conditions cause underlying commercial real estate values to decline 
the stress multiplier is based on the expectation that a loan s default rate will increase as the loan to value ratio increases 
the company reviewed its commercial real estate loan portfolio  and applied the stress multiplier to all commercial real estate loans where the borrower s loan to value ratio exceeded a specific threshold 
the stress multiplier was tiered and stepped up in specified increments as the loan to value ratio increased 
during  the company recognized the need to adjust this methodology to reflect more stable macroeconomic conditions  improvements in capital market liquidity  greater visibility on the economy and underlying asset values  as well as evidence of property price stabilization 
the company refined its approach for commercial real estate loans at this time primarily through three updates to the existing framework 
first  it calibrated the stress multipliers across all loan to value tiers to reflect increased depth in the financing markets compared to what was available in second  the category of credits on which the stress multipliers were applied was changed to credits with a weaker risk profile in addition to loan to value ratios in excess of the specified threshold  which remained unchanged 
last  estimates of loss upon a default were amended to reflect the results of an updated internal loss and recovery analysis 
the impact of these modifications was a decrease in the commercial real estate allowance for loan losses of approximately basis points 
if the company determines that additional changes in its allowance for credit losses methodology are advisable  as a result of changes in the economic environment or otherwise  the revised allowance methodology may result in higher or lower levels of allowance 
moreover  given uncertain market conditions  actual losses under the company s current or any revised allowance methodology may differ materially from the company s estimate 
additionally  when determining the amount of the general allowance  the company supplements the base amount with a judgmental amount which is governed by a score card system comprised of ten individually weighted risk factors 
the risk factors are designed based on those outlined in the comptrollers of the currency s allowance for loan and lease losses handbook 
the company also performs a ratio analysis of comparable money center banks  regional banks and finance companies 
while the company does not rely on this peer group comparison to set the level of allowance for credit losses  it does assist management in identifying market trends and serves as an overall reasonableness check on the allowance for credit losses computation 
during  we reduced our general allowance for credit losses to reflect improving performance in our non impaired loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impairment of a loan is based upon i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  depending on the circumstances and our collection strategy 
impaired loans are identified based on the loan by loan risk rating process described above 
impaired loans include all nonaccrual loans  loans with partial charge offs and loans which are troubled debt restructurings 
it is the company s policy during the reporting period to record a specific provision for credit losses for all loans for which we have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
impaired loans at december  were in real estate  leveraged finance  and business credit over a range of industries impacted by the then current economic environment including the following buildings and commercial real estate  broadcast and entertainment  nondurable consumer products  energy and chemical services  financial services  healthcare  printing and publishing  restaurants  and industrial and other business services 
for impaired leveraged finance loans  the company measured impairment based on expected cash 
table of contents flows utilizing relevant information provided by the borrower and consideration of other market conditions or specific factors impacting recoverability 
such amounts are discounted based on original loan terms 
for impaired real estate loans  the company determined that the loans were collateral dependent and measured impairment based on the fair value of the related collateral utilizing recent appraisals from third party appraisers  as well as internal estimates of market value 
loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the allowance 
the provision for credit losses and recoveries on loans previously charged off are added to the allowance 
valuation of deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary 
in performing these reviews we make estimates about future profits and tax planning strategies that would affect future taxable income and the realization of these deferred tax assets 
a change in these assumptions could result in a difference in valuation and impact our results of operations 
based upon our assessment  we believe that a valuation allowance was not necessary as of december  on january   the company adopted asc accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
a company can only recognize the tax position in the financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be upheld on audit  based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
if the recognition threshold is met  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
asc also addresses how interest and penalties should be accrued for uncertain tax positions  requiring that interest expense should be recognized in the first period interest would be accrued under the tax law 
the company classifies all interest and penalties on recognized tax benefits as a part of income tax expense 
at january   the company did not have any significant accrued interest or penalties 
at december   the company did not have any significant unrecognized tax benefits  and there have been no material changes since adoption 
the company does not expect any significant changes within the next months 
the company files us federal and state income tax returns 
as of december   the company s tax returns for the years ended   and remain subject to examination by the internal revenue service and state tax authorities 
fair value the company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain financial instruments and to determine fair value disclosures 
the company differentiates between those assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value at every reporting period recurring and those assets and liabilities that are only required to be adjusted to fair value under certain circumstances nonrecurring 
cash and cash equivalents  investments in debt securities  available for sale  residual interest in securitization and derivatives are financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
additionally  from time to time  the company may be required to record at fair value other financial assets on a nonrecurring basis  such as loans held for sale and loans held for investment 
these nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve 
table of contents application of the lower of cost or market accounting or write downs of individual assets 
further  the notes to the consolidated financial statements include information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities and the valuation methodologies used 
asc  fair value measurements asc establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date 
the three levels are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value  it is the company s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements  in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in asc when available  the company utilizes quoted market prices to measure fair value 
if market prices are not available  fair value measurement is based upon models that use primarily market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves  prepayment speeds  option volatilities and other assumptions 
however  in certain cases  when market observable inputs for model based valuation techniques may not be readily available  the company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of the financial instrument 
the models used by the company to determine fair value adjustments are periodically evaluated by management for relevance under current facts and circumstances 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters 
for financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
when observable market prices and parameters are not fully available  management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value 
in addition  changes in market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data 
for example  reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in secondary market activities could result in observable market inputs becoming unavailable 
therefore  when market data is not available  the company would use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement 
as of december   of total assets and of the assets we measured at fair value used significant unobservable inputs level assets 
during we recognized losses of million in other comprehensive income related to changes in fair value of these level assets 
the table below sets forth information regarding our level assets as of december  description fair value at december  in thousands commercial loans  net commercial real estate investments in debt securities  available for sale collateralized loan obligations total level assets at fair value 
table of contents revenue recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the respective loan and debt product 
the accrual of interest on loans and other debt products is discontinued when principal or interest payments are past due by days or more or when  in the opinion of management  it is probable we will be unable to collect contractual principal and interest in the normal course of business 
if loans are placed on non accrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed against current period interest income 
interest income on non accrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the principal balance is deemed collectible 
nonrefundable fees and related direct costs associated with the origination or purchase of loans and other debt products are deferred and netted against balances outstanding 
the net deferred fees or costs are recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the loans using a method which approximates the effective interest method 
in connection with the prepayment of a loan or other debt product  a partial amount of the remaining unamortized net deferred fees  costs  premiums or discounts are accelerated and recognized as interest income 
the amortization of fees is discontinued on non accrual loans 
depending on the terms of a loan or other debt product  we may charge a prepayment fee and recognize it in the period of the prepayment 
we accrete any discount and amortize any premium from purchased debt products or acquired loans in a business combination into interest income as a yield adjustment over the contractual life 
syndication  arrangement and structuring fees are recognized in the period the service is completed as a component of non interest income 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted asc share based payment  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values on the grant date 
we adopted asc using the prospective method 
for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january   we estimate the fair value of stock based awards using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions  including expected term and expected price volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the calculated fair value of stock based compensation and the related expense to be recognized 
further  for awards that contain performance measures and conditions  we make an assessment  based on management s judgment  of the probability of these conditions being satisfied  which affects the timing and the amount of expense to be recognized 
if our judgment as to whether these conditions are probable of occurrence are not appropriate  the financial statements could be materially affected 
business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method  assets and liabilities of the business acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition 
results of operations of the acquired business are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition 
equity method of accounting as the result of a troubled debt restructuring  we may acquire a portion of the equity in the borrower 
in certain cases where we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the borrower  we account for our equity interest under the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method of accounting  we recognize our proportional share of the borrower s net income as determined under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in our results of operations 
in cases where the equity of the underlying company has no value  and the borrower incurs losses  we will apply our proportional share of the gaap loss against the principal of the outstanding loan to the borrower 

table of contents valuation of investments in debt securities we review the fair value of our other debt products quarterly 
the fair value of our investments in debt securities  non investment grade securities and residual securities  are based on independent third party quoted market prices  when available  at the reporting date for those or similar investments 
when no market is available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis and internally generated financial models that incorporate significant assumptions and judgments  as well as qualitative factors 
even if the general accuracy of our valuation models are validated  there are no assurances that our valuations are accurate because of the high number of variables that affect cash flows associated with these complex cash flow structures  which differ on each securitization 
valuations are highly dependent upon the reasonableness of our assumptions and the predictability of the relationships that drive the results of the model 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
in addition  if our estimates or assumptions with respect to these assets prove to be incorrect  we may be required to write down some or all of the value of these assets 
a debt product is considered impaired when the fair value of the debt product declines below its amortized cost 
the cost basis of the investment is then written down to fair value 
if management determines the impairment to be temporary  it is recorded in other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
if management determines the impairment to be other than temporary  it is recorded as an offset to other income on our statements of operations 
from time to time we may become aware of cash flow or credit issues with respect to our other debt products and these other debt products are then monitored by management to determine if a write down is appropriate 
although we view write downs of our other debt products as a normal and anticipated aspect of our business  material write downs of the fair value of our other debt products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our allowance for credit losses does not cover write downs because we classify these assets as available for sale securities 
the description of certain instruments as debt securities is intended to describe the accounting treatment of those instruments and is not a characterization of those instruments as securities for any other purpose 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in market values of our loans held for sale  which are carried at lower of cost or market  and our investment in debt securities  available for sale and derivatives  which are carried at fair value 
fair value is defined as the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and for all other investments and derivatives  fair value is determined pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
where a market quotation is not readily available  we estimate fair value using various valuation methodologies  including cash flow analysis  as well as qualitative factors 
as of december  and  investments in debt securities available for sale totaled million and million  respectively 
at december  and  our net unrealized loss on those debt securities totaled million and million  respectively 
any unrealized gain or loss on these investments is included in other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet  until realized 
interest rate risk represents a market risk exposure to us 
our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect our net interest income 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility to our net interest income caused by changes in market interest rates 
during the normal course of business our lending to clients and our investments in debt securities create some interest rate risk as does the impact of ever changing market conditions 
our management attempts to mitigate this risk through our asset liability committee alco process taking into consideration balance sheet dynamics such as loan and investment growth and pricing  changes in funding mix and maturity characteristics 
the alco group reviews the overall rate risk position and strategy on an ongoing basis 
the alco group also reviews the impact on net interest income caused by changes in the shape of the yield curve as well as parallel shifts in the yield curve 
the following table shows the hypothetical estimated change in net interest income for a month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to our portfolio and cash and cash equivalents as of december  our modeling is based on contractual terms and does not consider prepayment rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months in thousands decrease of increase of as shown above  we estimate to the best of our ability that a decrease in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in an increase of million in our annualized net interest income  and an increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our net interest income of million 
the estimated changes in net interest income reflect the potential effect of interest rate floors on loans totaling approximately billion 
if interest rates rise  the potential impact from interest rate floors would decrease resulting in lower net interest income 
the cost of our variable rate debt would increase  while interest income from loans with interest rate floors would not change until interest rates exceed the stated rate of the interest rate floors or the loans paid off or re priced
