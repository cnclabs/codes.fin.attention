item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality on page of this form k 
employees as of february   we had full time and five part time corporate employees 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
none of our corporate employees are unionized 
environmental environmental consultants retained by us or our lenders have conducted environmental site assessments on many of our properties 
these environmental assessments often relied on older environmental assessments prepared in connection with a prior financing or acquisition 
the lenders did not conduct environmental assessments on our european properties  although older environmental assessments or building engineering surveys exist for these properties 
the environmental assessments are designed to evaluate the potential for environmental contamination on properties  but these assessments will not necessarily reveal the existence or extent of all environmental conditions  liabilities or compliance concerns at the properties 
although the environmental assessments that have been conducted with respect to certain of our properties disclose certain conditions on our properties and the use of hazardous substances in operation and maintenance activities that could pose a risk of environmental contamination or liability  we are not aware of any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see item a 
risk factors environmental and other governmental laws and regulations could increase our compliance costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and item a 
risk factors the presence of any environmental conditions at our properties could result in remediation and other costs and liabilities and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents insurance our management believes that our properties are adequately covered by insurance  subject to the risks described under item a 
risk factors  including  among others  the factors described under uninsured and underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  which may affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we are responsible for arranging the insurance for most of our hotels  although in certain cases  the hotel management companies that operate our hotels assume responsibility for arranging insurance under the relevant management agreement 
our properties are covered by blanket insurance policies  which cover multiple properties 
in the event that these blanket policies are drawn on to cover certain losses on certain properties  the amount of insurance coverage available under such policies could thereby be reduced and could be insufficient to cover the remaining properties insurable risks 
reit structure subject to certain limitations  reits may own  directly or indirectly  up to of the stock of a taxable reit subsidiary trs that can engage in businesses prohibited to a reit 
thus  hotel reits may own trss that lease hotels from the reit  rather than requiring the lessee to be a separate  unaffiliated party 
however  hotels leased to a trs must be managed by an unaffiliated third party 
the trs provisions are complex and impose several conditions on the use of trss 
no more than of a reit s assets may consist of securities of trss  and no more than of a reit s assets may consist of non qualifying assets  including securities of trss and other taxable subsidiaries

a lease between a strategic ownership entity and one of our trss an affiliate lease provides for the trs to pay to the strategic ownership entity a base rent plus a percentage rent as more fully described below 
an affiliate lease must contain economic terms that are similar to a lease between unrelated parties or  pursuant to the rma  the strategic ownership entity may have to pay a penalty tax on some of the payments it receives from our trs under such affiliate lease 
each affiliate lease has a non cancelable term of three to five years  subject to earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain contingencies such as damage or destruction that renders the hotel unsuitable for our trs use and occupancy  condemnation or our sale or disposition of the hotel 
during the term of each affiliate lease  our trs is obligated to pay a fixed annual base rent and a percentage rent to the applicable strategic ownership entity 
percentage rent is calculated by multiplying fixed percentages by gross room revenues and other revenues  subject to certain adjustments 
percentage rent is paid quarterly 
base rent accrues and is paid monthly 
base rents and percentage rents are adjusted annually for changes in the consumer price index or similar indices 
fixed charges  including real estate and personal property taxes  capital expenditures and a reserve for capital expenditures are obligations of the lessor under our affiliate lease 
our trss are required to pay rent  all costs and expenses and all utility and other charges incurred in the operation of the hotels we own 
the party responsible for maintaining insurance on a property is dependent on the specific lease
