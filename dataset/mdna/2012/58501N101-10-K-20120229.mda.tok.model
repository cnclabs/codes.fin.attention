overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the rapid development of novel small molecule drugs to treat serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options 
together with our collaboration partner  astellas pharma  inc  or astellas  we are developing mdv for multiple stages of advanced prostate cancer 
we have successfully completed the phase affirm trial in the latest stage patients those who have already failed docetaxel based chemotherapy and we are conducting an additional phase trial and two phase trials in men with earlier stages of advanced prostate cancer 
based on the positive results of the affirm trial  we have exercised our right under our collaboration agreement with astellas  or the astellas collaboration agreement  to co promote mdv in the us  should it receive marketing approval 
we and astellas expect to file applications for marketing approval for mdv both in the us and in europe in mdv has received fast track designation from the fda for the post docetaxel indication 
in october  we entered into the astellas collaboration agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we and astellas share equally the costs of developing and commercializing mdv for the united states market subject to the exceptions noted below  and we and astellas will share equally profits or losses resulting from the commercialization of mdv in the united states 
costs of clinical trials supporting development in both the united states and in either europe or japan are borne two thirds by astellas and one third by us 
both we and astellas will be responsible for all costs incurred in fielding and supporting our respective mdv sales forces  and each of us will be entitled to receive a fee for each detail made by our respective sales forces 
outside the united states  astellas will bear all development and commercialization costs and will pay us tiered  double digit royalties on the aggregate net sales of mdv in january  we reported negative top line results from our phase concert trial of our product candidate dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
we previously had reported negative 
table of contents top line results from our phase connection trial of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease and our phase horizon trial of dimebon in patients with huntington disease 
in january  pfizer  inc  or pfizer  exercised its right to terminate our collaboration agreement for the development and commercialization of dimebon and we and pfizer discontinued development of dimebon for all indications 
during the ensuing days  we and pfizer will work together to wind down our respective remaining collaboration activities 
our mdv series prostate cancer program we have obtained an exclusive  worldwide commercial license to a series of novel small molecules  referred to as the mdv series compounds 
our lead development candidate from the mdv series is a molecule we refer to as mdv a description of our completed and ongoing clinical trials is included below 
completed clinical trials phase affirm trial in november  we reported positive results from a planned interim analysis of the affirm trial  a randomized  double blind phase trial evaluating mdv mg once daily versus placebo in  patients with advanced prostate cancer who had previously failed docetaxel based chemotherapy 
the primary endpoint of the affirm trial was overall survival 
the independent data monitoring committee  or idmc  overseeing the affirm trial determined that mdv demonstrated a clinically meaningful and statistically significant p improvement in overall survival compared to placebo  and as a result recommended that the study be stopped early and men who received placebo be offered mdv the idmc informed us that mdv produced a month advantage in median survival compared to placebo  the estimated median survival for men treated with mdv was months compared to months for men treated with placebo  and mdv provided a reduction in risk of death compared to placebo hazard ratio 
the idmc further determined  considering the observed safety profile  that mdv demonstrated a favorable risk to benefit ratio sufficient to stop the study 
in february  we reported further results from the affirm trial at the american society of clinical oncology s genitourinary cancers symposium  or asco gu 
in addition to confirming the results reported in november  we reported that mdv had achieved all of the trial s secondary endpoints with strong statistical significance and was well tolerated 
as compared to patients taking placebo  mdv patients in the affirm trial experienced longer median radiographic progression free survival versus months  p  hazard ratio  a higher soft tissue response rate versus  p  and longer median time to prostate specific antigen  or psa  progression versus months  p  hazard ratio 
psa declines of or greater were more common in the mdv group than in the placebo group versus  p  as were psa declines of or greater versus  p 
mdv was well tolerated in the affirm trial 
common side effects included fatigue  diarrhea and hot flush 
serious adverse events  adverse events causing patients to stop treatment  and adverse events causing death all were lower in the mdv group than in the placebo group 
serious side effects of interest were fatigue in the mdv group versus in the placebo group  cardiac disorders versus including myocardial infarction versus  seizure versus and liver function test abnormalities versus 
the period during which affirm patients were followed for safety issues was more than twice as long for mdv patients months as compared to placebo patients months 
the fda has granted fast track designation for the development of mdv in the post chemotherapy indication  a designation that is reserved for development programs that the fda determines to be for a life threatening condition with unmet medical need 
receipt of fast track designation enables us to request that the fda grant us priority review for our anticipated new drug application  or nda  in post chemotherapy patients 
in considering requests for priority review  the fda applies the same standard it uses to award fast track designation 
we plan to hold a pre nda meeting with the fda in early we and astellas expect to file 
table of contents both an nda with the fda and a marketing authorization application  or maa  with the european medicines agency in seeking approval to market mdv for post docetaxel advanced prostate cancer in the us and europe  respectively 
based on the positive results from the affirm trial  we elected to exercise our right under the astellas collaboration agreement to co promote mdv in the us market 
should mdv receive marketing approval  we will provide of the sales and medical affairs support for mdv in the us market 
phase trial in december  we completed enrollment in an open label phase clinical trial of mdv in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer  or crpc 
we enrolled patients in seven dose groups  ranging from mg day to mg day 
of the patients  had previously failed docetaxel based chemotherapy and were chemotherapy na ve 
all patients also had failed at least one line of prior hormonal therapy 
the study endpoints include safety  tolerability  pharmacokinetics  circulating tumor cell  or ctc  counts  psa levels  radiographic change in soft tissue and bony metastases  and time to progression 
data from this trial were published in the lancet in these data showed that mdv consistently demonstrated anti tumor activity across endpoints  as evaluated by reductions in psa levels  radiographic findings and ctc counts 
this activity was consistently stronger in the earlier stage ie chemotherapy na ve as compared to the later stage ie  post chemotherapy patients 
key efficacy data as reported in the lancet were as follows chemotherapy na ve patients post chemotherapy patients psa decline from baseline radiographic control soft tissue lesions partial response or stable disease radiographic control bony lesions stable disease ctc conversion from poor prognosis to good prognosis in february  we presented new long term follow up data covering all patients enrolled in the trial at asco gu 
psa progression data reported at asco gu were calculated using three distinct reporting criteria the criteria specified in the phase trial protocol  the most recent published psa reporting consensus criteria the prostate cancer clinical trials working group  or pcwg  criteria  and an older commonly used reporting method the prostate specific antigen working group  or psawg  criteria 
key efficacy data as presented at asco gu were as follows chemotherapy na ve patients post chemotherapy patients median time to psa progression per protocol criteria not reached days weeks median time to psa progression per pcwg criteria days weeks days weeks median time to psa progression per psawg criteria days weeks days weeks days weeks median time to radiographic progression days weeks days weeks all chemotherapy na ve patients subpopulation of chemotherapy na ve patients who were also ketoconazole na ve 
table of contents mdv was well tolerated in this trial at doses up to and including mg day 
the most frequently reported adverse event was fatigue 
seizures were observed in two patients  one each at doses of and mg day 
both patients were taking concomitant medications that can cause seizures 
a possible but unwitnessed seizure was reported in a patient taking a dose of mg day 
ongoing clinical trials phase prevail trial prevail is a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial evaluating mdv mg once daily versus placebo in approximately  patients with advanced prostate cancer who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy 
the co primary endpoints are progression free survival and overall survival 
we began enrollment in the prevail trial in september phase terrain trial terrain is a randomized  double blind phase trial evaluating mdv versus bicalutamide  the leading marketed anti androgen drug  in approximately advanced prostate cancer patients who have progressed following medical castration with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog drug or surgical castration 
the primary endpoint is progression free survival 
we began enrollment in the terrain trial in march phase hormone na ve trial in may  we initiated a phase trial evaluating mdv in approximately patients with advanced prostate cancer who have not had any previous hormonal treatment 
this is the first trial to examine the effects of mdv in the earlier stage population of advanced prostate cancer patients who have not yet undergone medical or surgical castration 
the primary endpoint in the trial is psa response 
financial history we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we may never generate any revenue from product sales 
we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and from the up front  development milestone and cost sharing payments under our collaboration agreements 
we entered into a collaboration agreement with astellas in october  pursuant to which we received a non refundable up front cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of we subsequently received development milestone payments of million and million in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of  respectively 
we recorded development and commercialization cost sharing payments from astellas totaling million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
additional information regarding the astellas collaboration agreement is included in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources astellas collaboration agreement 
we entered into a collaboration agreement with pfizer in october  pursuant to which we received a non refundable up front cash payment of million in the fourth quarter of we recorded development and commercialization cost sharing payments from pfizer totaling million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in january  we reported negative top line results from our phase concert trial of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
we previously had reported negative top line results from our phase connection trial of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease and our phase horizon trial of dimebon in patients with huntington disease 
in january  pfizer exercised its right to terminate the collaboration agreement and 
table of contents we and pfizer discontinued development of dimebon for all indications in as discussed in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent events termination of pfizer collaboration agreement and dimebon program 
we have incurred cumulative net losses of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for the foreseeable future as we pursue regulatory approval for  and  if approved  commercial launch of  mdv and continue to finance clinical and preclinical studies of our existing and potential future product candidates and our corporate overhead costs 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million available to fund our operations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for the next months 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could exhaust our available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments earlier than presently anticipated 
we may be required or choose to seek additional capital within the next months to expand our clinical development activities for mdv based on the positive results of our phase affirm trial in post chemotherapy advanced prostate cancer patients  to fund costs of planning for and executing a commercial launch of mdv  should it receive marketing approval  if we face challenges or delays in connection with our clinical trials or the potential approval and commercialization of mdv  or to maintain minimum cash balances that we deem reasonable and prudent 
in addition  we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital in the form of equity  convertible debt or otherwise  depending on market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time  and we may seek to raise additional capital within the next months should we conclude that such capital is available on terms that we consider to be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 
subsequent events termination of pfizer collaboration agreement and dimebon program in january  we reported negative top line results from our phase concert trial of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
we previously had reported negative top line results from our phase connection trial of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease and our phase horizon trial of dimebon in patients with huntington disease 
in january  pfizer exercised its right to terminate the collaboration agreement and we and pfizer discontinued development of dimebon for all indications 
during the ensuing days  we and pfizer will work together to wind down our respective remaining collaboration activities 
we estimate that we and pfizer will complete our respective collaboration wind down activities in the first half of thus  during the first quarter of we revised our estimate of the remaining performance period under our former collaboration agreement with pfizer 
we expect the performance period to conclude in the first half of the remaining deferred revenue balance relating to the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  which totaled million at december   will be recognized as revenue over the remaining performance period 
oakbrook terrace lease in february  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of office space located in oakbrook terrace  illinois  which is intended to serve as our commercial headquarters following construction and build out 
the term of the lease is seven years and seven months  with an anticipated commencement date of may we selected this location for our commercial headquarters based on its proximity to our collaboration partner  astellas 
the annual non cancelable rent payments are approximately million per year 
in connection with the execution of the lease  we delivered to the lessor a letter of credit collateralized by restricted cash totaling million 

table of contents critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap  requires that management make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
a detailed description of our significant accounting policies is included in the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we believe that certain of our accounting policies are critical because they are the most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies require our most subjective and complex judgments  often requiring the use of estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we apply estimation methodologies consistent from year to year 
other than changes required due to the issuance of new accounting guidance  there have been no significant changes in our application of our critical accounting policies during the periods presented 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that we consider critical to our consolidated financial statements 
estimated performance periods under our collaboration agreements both the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer contain multiple elements and deliverables  and required evaluation pursuant to the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreements to determine whether we had obligations constituting deliverables under asc we concluded that we had multiple deliverables under both collaboration agreements  including deliverables relating to grants of technology licenses  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development activities in the us in the case of the astellas collaboration agreement  the period in which we perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and at december   management estimated that it would be completed in the fourth quarter of in the case of the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  the period in which we perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and at december   management estimated that it would be completed in the fourth quarter of we also concluded that our deliverables under each collaboration agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting under asc estimation of the performance periods of our deliverables requires the use of our management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance period include  but are not limited to  our experience  along with astellas and pfizer s experience  in conducting clinical development and regulatory activities 
we review the estimated duration of our performance periods under both collaborations on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
during the year ended december   we extended the estimated completion date of our performance period under the former collaboration agreement with pfizer from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  based on the failure of the connection trial and the resulting longer period required to complete the clinical trials evaluating dimebon s potential safety and efficacy as a treatment for mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
in january  pfizer exercised its right to terminate the collaboration agreement 
as a result  during the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the remaining performance period under the collaboration agreement 
we expect to complete our remaining performance obligations pursuant to the terms of the former collaboration agreement with pfizer in the first half of future changes in estimates of either of the performance periods under our collaboration agreements could significantly impact the timing of future revenue recognized under the applicable collaboration agreement 

table of contents collaboration agreement payments we account for the various payment flows under our collaboration agreements in a consistent manner  as follows up front payments 
we received non refundable up front cash payments of million and million under our collaboration agreement with astellas and our former collaboration agreement with pfizer  respectively 
we recognize these payments as revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable estimated performance period 
milestone payments 
we are eligible to receive milestone payments under the astellas collaboration agreement based on achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercial events 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments  and concluded that these events except for a those relating to regulatory activities in europe  development and regulatory activities in japan  and commercial activities  all of which are areas in which we have no pertinent contractual responsibilities  and b the initiation of our phase prevail trial  an event which management deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the astellas collaboration constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that i each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  ii achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us  iii each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  iv achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  v substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  vi the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  vii a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the up front payment and the potential milestone payments  and viii the milestone payments relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
for the contingent payments triggered by events that do not constitute substantive milestones  management concluded that the appropriate revenue recognition treatment depends on whether the triggering event occurs during or after the performance period 
where the triggering event occurs during the applicable performance period  we will amortize any revenue from this event on a straight line basis over the applicable performance period 
where the triggering event occurs after the applicable performance period  we will recognize the associated revenue in the period in which the event occurs 
royalties and profit sharing payments 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  we are eligible to receive profit sharing payments on sales of products in the us and royalties on sales of products outside the us we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenues  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 
cost sharing payments 
under both the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  we and our collaboration partners share certain development and commercialization costs in the us the parties make quarterly cost sharing payments to one another in amounts necessary to ensure that each party bears its contractual share of the overall development and commercialization costs as incurred 
our policy is to account for cost sharing payments to our collaboration partners as increases in expense in our consolidated statements of operations  while cost sharing payments from our collaborative partners are presented as reductions in expense 
cost sharing payments related to development activities and commercialization activities are recorded in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively 

table of contents stock based compensation we have granted stock options  restricted stock units  performance share awards and stock appreciation rights pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated equity incentive award plan 
we account for stock based compensation awards granted to employees and directors in accordance with asc  stock compensation  and have applied the provisions of the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
and no 
 in our application of asc stock compensation arrangements with consultants are accounted for in accordance with asc and asc  equity based payments to non employees  using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to re measurement over the vesting terms as earned 
we determine stock based compensation expense associated with stock options based on the estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  expected option term  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
for employee and director stock options  we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards 
stock options granted to consultants are valued at their respective measurement dates and recognized as expense based on the portion of the total consulting services provided during the applicable period 
as further consulting services are provided in each period  we revalue the associated awards and recognize additional expense based on their then current fair values 
stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date  which equals the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date of the award 
for restricted stock units  we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards 
performance share awards allow the recipients of such awards to earn fully vested shares of our common stock based on the achievement of pre established performance objectives specified in the awards 
stock based compensation expense associated with performance share awards is based on the estimated grant date fair value of our common stock using the black scholes valuation model and is recognized based upon our best estimates of the achievement of the performance objectives specified in such awards and the resulting number of shares that are expected to be earned 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the probability of achieving the performance criteria 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated number of performance share awards expected to be earned is recognized as compensation expense or as reduction of previously recognized compensation expense in the period of the revised estimate 
the fair value of stock settled and cash settled stock appreciation rights is initially measured on the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions related to the expected stock price volatility  expected term  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
similar to stock options  compensation expense for stock settled stock appreciation rights is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value 
cash settled stock appreciation rights are liability classified awards for which compensation expense and the liability are remeasured at each reporting date through the date of settlement based on the portion of the requisite service period rendered 
we apply a forfeiture rate when determining stock based compensation expense to account for an estimate of the granted awards not expected to vest 
if actual forfeitures differ from the expected rate  we may be required to make additional adjustments to compensation expense in future periods 
the black scholes valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferrable  characteristics not present in our option grants 
if the model permitted consideration of the unique characteristics of employee stock options and stock appreciation rights  the resulting estimate of the fair value of the stock options and stock appreciation rights could be different 
in addition  if we had made different assumptions and estimates for use in the black scholes valuation model  the amount of recognized and to be recognized stock based compensation expense could have been different 

table of contents research and development expense and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties to provide research and development services to us  costs are expensed as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials and other research and development activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and contract research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various research and development activities in the on going development of our product candidates  including without limitation  third party clinical trial centers and contract research organizations that perform and administer our clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials and other research and development activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific agreement 
our estimates are dependent upon the time lines and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustment to our research and development expense in future periods 
to date  we have had no significant adjustments 
leases at the inception of a lease  we evaluate the lease agreement to determine whether the lease is an operating or a capital lease using the criteria in asc  leases 
for operating leases  we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the non cancellable lease term and record the difference between cash rent payments and the recognition of rent expense as a deferred liability 
where lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses  rent abatements and or concessions  such as rent holidays and tenant improvement allowances  we apply them in the determination of straight line rent expense over the lease term 
we currently have no capital leases 
certain lease agreements also require us to make additional payments under the lease term for taxes  insurance  and other operating expenses incurred during the lease period  which are expensed as incurred 
income taxes we establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  based on the technical support for the position  our past audit experiences with similar situations  and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
our recorded reserves represent our best estimate of the amount  if any  that we may ultimately be required to pay to settle such matters 
the resolution of our uncertain income tax positions is dependent on uncontrollable factors such as law changes  new case law  and the willingness of the income tax authorities to settle  including the timing thereof and other factors 
although we do not anticipate significant changes to our uncertain income tax positions in the next months  items outside of our control could cause our uncertain income tax positions to change in the future  which would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
interest and or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of income tax expense as incurred 

table of contents we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the asc  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative historic losses represented sufficient negative evidence under asc and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance

results of operations collaboration revenue years ended december  collaboration revenue from astellas collaboration revenue from pfizer total percentage change the decrease in collaboration revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was due to a change in estimate of the remaining performance period under our former collaboration agreement with pfizer  which is discussed below 
collaboration revenue for the year ended december  includes the incremental amortization resulting from million and million of development milestone payments received from our collaboration partner  astellas  during the second quarter of and the fourth quarter of  respectively  which have been deferred on our consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated performance period with astellas 
the million decrease in collaboration revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was driven by lower collaboration revenues of million from our former collaboration agreement with pfizer due to the extension of our estimated performance period from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  which is discussed below 
this was partially offset by an increase of million in collaboration revenue from the astellas collaboration agreement  which was in effect for only one quarter in 
table of contents to date  we have received million and million of up front and development milestone payments under the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  respectively 
at december   deferred revenue balances with respect to these collaboration agreements were million and million  respectively 
we amortize deferred revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated performance period of our deliverables under the applicable collaboration agreement 
at december   management estimated that our performance periods under the astellas collaboration agreement and the former collaboration agreement with pfizer will be completed in the fourth quarter of and  respectively 
during the year ended december   we extended the estimated completion date of our performance period under the former collaboration agreement with pfizer from the second quarter of to the fourth quarter of  based on the failure of the connection trial and the resulting longer period required to complete the clinical trials evaluating dimebon s potential safety and efficacy as a treatment for mild to moderate alzheimer s disease 
the cumulative effect of these changes  which we applied on a prospective basis  was to extend the performance period by seven quarters and correspondingly reduce collaboration revenue related to the former collaboration agreement with pfizer by million per quarter over the remaining estimated performance period 
in january  pfizer exercised its right to terminate the collaboration agreement as discussed in the section titled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent events termination of pfizer collaboration agreement and dimebon program 
during the ensuing days  we and pfizer will work together to wind down our respective remaining collaboration activities 
we estimate that we and pfizer will complete our respective collaboration wind down activities in the first half of thus  during the first quarter of  we revised our estimate of the remaining performance period under our former collaboration agreement with pfizer 
we expect the performance period to conclude in the first half of the remaining deferred revenue balance relating to the former collaboration agreement with pfizer  which totaled million at december   will be recognized as revenue over the remaining performance period 
future changes in estimates of the performance periods under our collaboration agreements could significantly impact the timing of future revenue recognized under the applicable collaboration agreement 
research and development expense years ended december  research and development expense percentage change research and development  or r d  expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a million increase in payroll related expenses associated with increased headcount and higher bonus expense  a million increase in consulting and professional service expenses associated with increased workload on our affirm and prevail trials and million in preclinical expenses associated with new programs 
these items were partially offset by lower clinical expenses of million resulting primarily from reduced dimebon development activities 
r d expenses decreased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in up front and development milestone sharing expense to the regents of the university of california  or ucla  pursuant to the terms of our mdv license agreement and a million decrease in payroll costs resulting from favorable changes in employee related cost sharing payments with our collaboration partner astellas and former collaboration partner pfizer

we recorded development cost sharing payments from astellas and pfizer  and corresponding reductions in research and development expense  as follows years ended december  development cost sharing payments from astellas development cost sharing payments from pfizer total to date  we have been engaged in two major research and development programs the development of mdv for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and the development of dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
other research and development programs consist of earlier stage programs 
research and development costs are identified as either directly allocable to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist primarily of clinical and preclinical study costs  cost of supplying drug substance and drug product for use in clinical and preclinical studies  personnel costs including both cash costs and non cash stock based compensation costs  contract research organization fees  and other contracted services pertaining to specific clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect costs consist of corporate overhead costs and other administrative and support costs 
the following table summarizes the direct costs attributable to each program and the total indirect costs for each respective period 
years ended december  direct costs mdv dimebon other total direct costs indirect costs total our projects or intended projects may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our research and development priorities and available resources 
based on the negative results in the phase connection  horizon and concert trials  we and pfizer have discontinued development of dimebon for all indications in in january  pfizer exercised its right to terminate the collaboration agreement as discussed in the section titled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent events termination of pfizer collaboration agreement and dimebon program 
in order to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we will need to establish to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authorities in the united states  europe and other relevant countries that the applicable product candidate is both safe and effective for each of its intended indications 
the process of conducting the preclinical and clinical testing required to establish safety and efficacy and obtain regulatory approvals is expensive  uncertain and takes many years 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the time or cost required to obtain such regulatory approvals  and failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
the length of time required for clinical development of a 
table of contents particular product candidate and our development costs for that product candidate may be impacted by the scope and timing of enrollment in clinical trials for the product candidate  unanticipated additional clinical trials that may be required  future decisions to develop a product candidate for subsequent indications  and whether in the future we decide to pursue development of the product candidate with a corporate partner or independently 
for example  mdv may have the potential to be approved for multiple indications  and we do not yet know how many of those indications we and our partner  astellas  will pursue 
the decision to pursue regulatory approval for subsequent indications will depend on several variables outside of our control  including the strength of the data generated in our prior and ongoing clinical and non clinical studies and the willingness of our corporate partner to jointly fund such additional work 
furthermore  the scope and number of clinical studies required to obtain regulatory approval for each pursued indication is subject to the input of the applicable regulatory authorities  we have not yet sought such input for all potential indications that we and our collaboration partner may elect to pursue  and even after having given such input applicable regulatory authorities may subsequently require additional clinical studies prior to granting regulatory approval based on new data generated by us or other companies  or for other reasons outside of our control 
moreover  we or our current or potential future collaboration partners may decide to discontinue development of any development project at any time for regulatory  commercial  scientific or other reasons 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our product candidates and in fact may never do so 
selling  general and administrative expense years ended december  selling  general and administrative expense percentage change selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to a million increase in payroll related expenses associated with increased headcount and higher bonus expense  a million increase in legal fees primarily related to a litigation matter we initiated in the second quarter of against the licensor of our mdv technology and the defense of the securities class action lawsuit following the negative results in our connection trial  for which we are subject to a  retention 
the increase in sg a expense was further impacted by an increase in sales and marketing expenses of million as a result of increased market research and public relations expense due to the positive results of our phase affirm trial discussed elsewhere in this annual report and recruitment expenses of million as a result of increased headcount in these items were partially offset by restructuring costs and a lease termination fee in response to the negative results of our phase connection trial discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
sg a expense decreased by million  or  in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was due primarily to decreases of million in consulting and professional services fees  million in payroll and other costs associated with lower headcount related to our sg a activities and million in sales and marketing expenses 
these expense reductions were largely pursuant to the restructuring that we implemented in march in response to the negative results of our connection trial 
sg a expenses represented  and of total operating expenses in the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect sg a expenses to continue to increase as a percentage of our overall operating expenses as we hire additional staff and incur additional expenses in preparation for a potential commercial launch of mdv in post chemotherapy advanced prostate cancer

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have incurred cumulative net losses of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for the foreseeable future as we pursue regulatory approval for  and  if approved  commercial launch of  mdv and continue to finance clinical and preclinical studies of mdv and potential future product candidates and our corporate overhead costs 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we may never generate any revenue from product sales 
our operations to date have been funded primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock and from the up front  development milestone and cost sharing payments from our collaboration partner astellas and from our former collaboration partner  pfizer 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million available to fund our operations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations for the next months 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investment earlier than presently anticipated 
we may be required or choose to seek additional capital within the next months to expand our clinical development activities for mdv based on the positive results of our phase affirm trial in post chemotherapy advanced prostate cancer patients  to fund costs of planning for and executing a commercial launch of mdv  should it receive marketing approval  if we face challenges or delays in connection with our clinical trials or the potential approval and commercialization of mdv  or to maintain minimum cash balances that we deem reasonable and prudent 
in addition  we intend to evaluate the capital markets from time to time to determine whether to raise additional capital in the form of equity  convertible debt or otherwise  depending on market conditions relative to our need for funds at such time  and we may seek to raise additional capital within the next months should we conclude that such capital is available on terms that we consider to be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 
our current view of the worldwide capital markets is that they are extremely volatile with limited accessibility  and many biotechnology companies have had limited or no success in obtaining funding in this environment 
continuation of this challenging market climate may significantly limit our ability to raise funds  and there can be no assurance we will be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing would be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 

table of contents our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  many of which are wholly or partially outside of our control 
such factors include  without limitation potential launch costs of mdv  should that agent receive marketing approval for post chemotherapy patients  the timing and magnitude of any potential sales of mdv  should that agent receive marketing approval for post chemotherapy patients  whether any changes are made to the scope of our ongoing clinical development activities  the scope and results of our and our collaboration partner s preclinical and clinical trials  whether we experience delays in our preclinical and clinical development programs  including potential delays in recruiting  or inability to recruit  patients into our ongoing prevail trial of mdv in pre chemotherapy advanced prostate cancer as a result of the availability of zytiga abiraterone acetate  which was approved by the fda in april for post chemotherapy patients  or other investigational and approved prostate cancer therapies  including mdv itself should that agent be approved to treat post chemotherapy patients  or slower than anticipated product development  whether opportunities to acquire additional product candidates arise and the timing and costs of acquiring and developing those product candidates  whether we are able to enter into additional third party collaborative partnerships to develop and or commercialize potential future product candidates on terms  including development cost share terms  that are acceptable to us  the timing and requirements of  and the costs involved in  conducting studies required to obtain regulatory approvals for mdv or potential future product candidates from the fda and comparable foreign regulatory agencies  the availability of third parties to perform the key development tasks for mdv and potential future product candidates  including conducting preclinical and clinical studies and manufacturing our product candidates to be tested in those studies  and the associated costs of those services  expenses associated with the pending purported securities class action lawsuits  as well as any other litigation  and the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending the validity of and enforcing patent claims and other costs related to patent rights and other intellectual property rights  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation

in february  we entered into a lease agreement for  square feet of office space located in oakbrook terrace  illinois  which is intended to serve as our commercial headquarters following construction and build out 
the term of the lease is seven years and seven months  with an anticipated commencement date of may we selected this location for our commercial headquarters based on its proximity to our collaboration partner  astellas 
the annual non cancelable rent payments are approximately million per year 
in connection with the execution of the lease  we delivered to the lessor a letter of credit collateralized by restricted cash totaling million 
the future minimum lease payments under this lease are not included in the table above 
in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed in the table above  we have other potential obligations for which the timing and the extent of future payments are not known 
we have described these potential obligations in the following paragraphs 
at december   million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities for uncertain income tax positions 
the ultimate resolution of our uncertain income tax positions is dependent on uncontrollable factors such as law changes  new case law  and the willingness of the income tax authorities to settle  including the timing thereof  and other factors 
although we do not anticipate significant changes to our uncertain income tax positions in the next twelve months  items outside of our control could cause our uncertain income tax positions to change in the future 
such amounts have been included on our consolidated balance sheet at december   but have not been included in the table above

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our cash equivalents on deposit in highly liquid money market accounts and short term investments in highly liquid us treasury securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
our investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates rise 
there were no material changes to our market risk from those disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and us treasury securities  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  due to the short term  highly liquid nature of our investments  we do not believe that we are subject to any material market risk exposure related to interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the us although we conduct some research and development work with vendors outside the us  most of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
however  certain of our ex us clinical development activities are pursuant to contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in foreign currency exchange losses
