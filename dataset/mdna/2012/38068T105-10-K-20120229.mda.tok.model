developments during we completed our first full year of commercial production of gold and silver in two mines are located at our el aguila project  the el aguila open pit mine and the la arista underground mine 
mining at the el aguila open pit mine was essentially completed in in the first two months of  we continued to process el aguila open pit ore that was stockpiled through the el aguila mill 
we produced metal concentrates with gold as our primary metal product and silver as a by product 
during late  we commenced development of the la arista mine  located approximately kilometers from the el aguila mill  and began mining the la arista vein system 
beginning in march and for the remainder of the year  we processed ore primarily from the la arista mine  where gold and silver were our primary metal products and copper  lead and zinc were considered by products 
our focus during was the development of the la arista underground mine and we constructed a primary spiral decline ramp that reached level by the end of we began mining and processing ore from mine development activity and from a few stopes during additionally  in we completed construction of the second phase of our tailings impoundment facility using waste material from the open pit mine 
we also made improvements to the mill facility by expanding the capacity of our cleaner flotation cells in the flotation circuit 
commercial production during  we produced a total of  ounces of gold equivalent from the el aguila project at an approximate average cash operating cost of per ounce  net of by product credits 
see  non gaap measures in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for more information 
we processed an aggregate of  tonnes of ore with an average grade of grams per tonne gold and grams per tonne silver 
see the table titled production and sales statistics el aguila project in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for detailed information regarding our production statistics 
an anomalous storm in april flooded the lowest levels of the la arista underground mine which negatively impacted our mining operations for approximately two months 

table of contents exploration exploration during was focused primarily on the el aguila project with infill and step out drilling at the la arista vein system 
we also performed exploration at several of our properties  including commencing a surface exploration program on portions of the las margaritas property and a limited drilling campaign at alta gracia and el chamizo 
please see the map of our properties on page for more information regarding our exploration properties 
at alta gracia and el chamizo  we are drilling from the surface at these properties focusing on previously identified drill targets 
we are also conducting some underground exploration and testing at the alta gracia property by driving drifts and crosscuts into exposed veins 
at the el rey property  we began to drain and refurbish an existing shaft to facilitate additional exploration and gain access underground to test a vein system identified from earlier drilling 
we also carried out a geophysical survey  called titan  over a large part of the el aguila project area which resulted in several very distinct geologic anomalies 
however  we have not established proven or probable reserves as defined in the sec s industry guide guide at our el aguila project or any of our other properties 
see item properties for additional information regarding our exploration activities 
dividends commencing in july  we declared special dividends for each month until august when we instituted a regular monthly dividend of per share 
we declared an aggregate of per share in dividends in the dividends have been charged against our additional paid in capital and are considered a return of capital dividend 
see  item market for common equity  related stockholder matters and purchase of equity securities  for additional information 
no proven or probable reserves we have not yet demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at our el aguila project in oaxaca  mexico or any of our other properties 
in guide  the sec defines a reserve as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
proven or probable reserves are those reserves for which a quantity is computed and b the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are spaced so closely that the geologic character is defined and size  shape and depth of mineral content can be established proven or the sites are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced but high enough to assume continuity between observation points probable 
reserves cannot be considered proven and probable unless and until they are supported by a feasibility study  indicating that the reserves have had the requisite geologic  technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable 
we have not completed a feasibility study with regard to all or a portion of any of our properties to date 
any mineralized material discovered or produced by us should not be considered proven or probable reserves 
as of december   none of our mineralized material met the definition of proven or probable reserves 
competitive business conditions the exploration for  and the acquisition of gold and silver properties  are subject to intense competition 
due to our limited capital and personnel  we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and  if warranted  development of mining properties 
our present limited funding means that our ability to compete for properties to be explored and developed is limited 
we believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future 
government regulations and permits in connection with mining  milling and exploration activities  we are subject to extensive mexican federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment  including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality  hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species 
the department responsible for environmental protection in mexico is semarnat  which is similar to the united states environmental protection agency 
semarnat has broad authority to shut down and or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with its environmental regulations or standards 
potential areas of environmental consideration for mining companies  including ours  include but are not limited to  acid rock drainage  cyanide containment and handling  contamination of water courses  dust and noise 

table of contents in connection with our mill and mining operations at the el aguila project  we have and will continue to secure various regulatory permits from federal  state and local agencies 
these governmental and regulatory permits generally govern the processes being used to operate  the stipulations concerning air quality and water issues  and the plans and obligations for reclamation of the properties at the conclusion of operations 
regulations require that an environmental impact statement  known in mexico as a manifiestacion de impacto ambiental mia  be prepared by a third party contractor for submission to semarnat 
we have submitted our mia to semarnat for their review and it has been approved 
studies required to support the mia include a detailed analysis of these areas  among others soil  water  vegetation  wildlife  cultural resources and socio economic impacts 
although the regulatory process in mexico has a public review component  proof of local community support for a project is required to gain final mia approval 
we have received the required local community support 
we received a federal permit granting permission to begin open pit mining at the el aguila project from semarnat in august and commenced mining operations 
in december  we also received a permit allowing us to begin developing our underground mine 
we purchased a permitted water well for the mill site at the el aguila project 
we believe the water provided by this well will normally be adequate to meet the needs for any mining activity for the foreseeable future  but any extreme seasonal changes may result in limited water 
we have obtained  and will obtain at the appropriate time  environmental permits  licenses or approvals required for operations 
we are not aware of any material violations of environmental permits  licenses or approvals issued with respect to our operations 
customers during the year ended december   of our total sales of metals concentrate were made to consorcio minero de mexico cormin mex 
sa de sa consorcio and of our sales were to beheer  sa of lucerne  switzerland beheer  each a trafigura group company 
in the event that our relationship with consorcio or beheer is interrupted for any reason  we believe that we would be able to locate another entity to purchase our metals concentrate and by product metals 
however  any interruption could temporarily disrupt the sale of our principal products and adversely affect our operating results 
employees we currently have seven full time employees in the united states  three of which serve as our executive officers 
these individuals devote all of their business time to our affairs 
we also engage several financial consultants  including our chief financial officer  who provide us their services as necessary to assist with our administrative and financial affairs 
in mexico  through our wholly owned mexican subsidiaries  we employ approximately mexican nationals  including our el aguila project manager  exploration manager and country manager 
we also use various independent contractors for developing our underground mine  surface exploration drilling and trucking 
item a 
risk factors this report  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  contains forward looking statements that may be materially affected by several risk factors  including those summarized below risks relating to our company we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not continue to be profitable 
we achieved our first year of profitability in since our inception in during the fiscal years ended december  and  we reported net losses of approximately million and million  respectively and we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  while we were profitable in  there is no assurance that we will continue to be profitable in the future 
unexpected interruptions in our mining business may cause us to incur losses or the revenue we generate from production may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations including exploration and development costs 
our failure to report future profits may adversely affect the price of our common stock and you may lose all or part of your investment 

table of contents our existing production is limited to a single mine and any interruptions or stoppages in our mining activities would adversely affect our revenue 
we are presently relying on a single mine to provide ore for processing at our mill facility which contains the mineralized material we sell to fund our operations 
any interruption in our ability to mine this location  such as a labor strike  natural disaster  or loss of permits would negatively impact our ability to collect revenue in the foreseeable future 
additionally  if we are unable to economically develop additional mines  we will eventually deplete the ore body and will no longer generate revenue sufficient to fund our operations 
a decrease in or cessation of our mining operations would adversely affect our financial performance and may eventually cause us to cease operations 
we have no proven or probable reserves and our decision to commence commercial production is not based on a study demonstrating economical recovery of any mineral reserves and is therefore inherently risky 
any funds spent by us on exploration or development could be lost 
we have not established the presence of any proven or probable mineral reserves  as defined by the sec  at any of our properties 
under guide  the sec has defined a reserve as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
any mineralized material discovered or produced by us should not be considered proven or probable reserves 
in order to demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves  it would be necessary for us to perform additional exploration to demonstrate the existence of sufficient mineralized material with satisfactory continuity and obtain a positive feasibility study which demonstrates with reasonable certainty that the deposit can be economically and legally extracted and produced 
we have not completed a feasibility study with regard to all or a portion of any of our properties to date 
since we commenced commercial production of mineralized material at the el aguila project without a feasibility study  there is inherent uncertainty as to whether the mineralized material can be economically produced or if so  for what period of time 
the absence of proven or probable reserves makes it more likely that our properties may cease to be profitable and that the money we spend on exploration and development may never be recovered 
since we have no proven or probable reserves  our investment in mineral properties is not reported as an asset in our financial statements which may have a negative impact on the price of our stock 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have reported substantially all exploration and construction expenditures as expenses until such time  if ever  we are able to establish proven or probable reserves  and expect to continue that practice in the future 
if we are able to establish proven or probable reserves  we would report development expenditures as an asset subject to future amortization using the units of production method 
since it is uncertain when  if ever  we will establish proven or probable reserves  it is uncertain whether we will ever report these types of future capital expenditures as an asset 
accordingly  our historical financial statements report fewer assets and greater expenses than would be the case if we had proven or probable reserves  which could have a negative impact on our stock price 
estimates of mineralized material are based on interpretation and assumptions and may yield less mineral production under actual conditions than is currently estimated 
when making determinations about whether to advance any of our projects to development  such as the el aguila project  we rely upon estimated calculations as to the mineralized material on our properties 
since we have not conducted a feasibility study demonstrating proven or probable reserves  estimates of mineralized material presented in our press releases and regulatory filings contain less certainty than would be the case if the estimates were made in accordance with the sec recognized definition of proven and probable reserves 
until mineralized material is actually mined and processed  it must be considered an estimate only 
these estimates are imprecise and depend on geological interpretation and statistical inferences drawn from drilling and sampling analysis  which may prove to be unreliable 
we cannot assure you that these mineralized material estimates will be accurate or that this mineralized material can be mined or processed profitably and any decision to move forward with development is inherently risky 
any material changes in estimates of mineralized material will affect the economic viability of placing a property into production and such property s return on capital 
this risk is increased since we have not received a feasibility study on any of our properties 
there can be no assurance that minerals recovered in small scale metallurgical tests will be recovered at production scale 
these in place mineralized material estimates will be diluted in the mining process 
the volatility of the price of gold and silver could adversely affect our future operations and  if warranted  our ability to develop our properties 
the profitability of our operations  the value of our properties and our ability to raise funding to conduct continued exploration and development  if warranted  are directly related to the market price of gold  silver and other precious metals 
the price of gold may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock 
our decision to put a mine into production and to commit the funds necessary for that purpose must be made long before the first revenue from production would be received 
a decrease in the price of gold and silver may prevent our property from being economically mined or result in the write off of assets whose value is impaired as a result of lower gold or silver prices 
the price of gold and silver is affected by numerous factors beyond our control  including inflation  fluctuation of the united states dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  the sale of gold and silver by central banks  and the political and economic conditions of major gold and silver producing countries throughout the world 

table of contents the volatility in gold and silver prices is illustrated by the following table  which sets forth for each of the past five calendar years  the average annual market prices in us dollars per ounce of gold and silver based on the daily london pm fix mineral gold silver the volatility of mineral prices represents a substantial risk which no amount of planning or technical expertise can fully eliminate 
in the event gold prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time  we might be unable to develop our properties  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial performance and cash flows 
we currently do not enter into forward sales  commodity  derivatives or hedging arrangements with respect to our gold and silver production and as a result we are exposed to the impact of any significant decrease in the price of gold or silver 
we sell the gold and silver we are producing at the prevailing market price 
currently  we do not enter into forward sales  commodity  derivative or hedging arrangements to establish a price in advance for the sale of future gold or silver production  although we may do so in the future 
as a result  we may realize the benefit of any short term increase in the gold or silver price  but we are not protected against decreases in the gold or silver price  and if the gold or silver price decreases significantly  our revenues may be materially adversely affected 
if we are unable to achieve gold and silver production levels anticipated from our el aguila project  our financial condition and results of operation will be adversely affected 
we have proceeded with the processing of the el aguila open pit area ore and the development of the la arista mine at the el aguila project based on estimates of mineralized material identified in our drilling program and estimates of gold and silver recovery based on test work developed during our scoping study 
however  risks related to metallurgy are inherent when working with extractable minerals 
sales of gold and silver that we realize from future mining activity will be less than anticipated if the mined material does not contain the concentration of gold and silver predicted by our geological exploration 
this risk may be increased since we have not sought or obtained a feasibility study or reserve report with regard to any of our properties 
if sales of gold and silver are less than anticipated  we may not be able to recover our investment in our property and our operations may be adversely affected 
our inability to realize production based on quarterly or annual projections may also adversely affect the price of our common stock and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our current property portfolio is limited to a single producing property and our ability to remain profitable over the long term will depend on our ability to identify  explore and develop additional properties 
gold and silver properties are wasting assets 
they eventually become depleted or uneconomical to continue mining 
the acquisition of gold and silver properties and their exploration and development are subject to intense competition 
companies with greater financial resources  larger staff  more experience and more equipment for exploration and development may be in a better position than us to compete for such mineral properties 
if we are unable to find  develop  and economically mine new properties  we most likely will not be profitable on a long term basis and the price of our common stock may suffer 
our producing property is subject to a lease in favor of a third party which provides for royalties on production 
we lease our el aguila property from a third party 
our lease for the el aguila property provides for a net smelter return royalty of where production is sold in the form of gold silver dor and where production is sold in concentrate form 
all of our production to date has been processed and sold as concentrate 
the requirement to pay royalties to the owner of the concessions at our el aguila property  which includes the open pit mine and underground mine  will reduce our profitability from production of gold or other precious metals 
since we have a very limited operating history  investors have little basis to evaluate our ability to operate 
we were organized in and declared commercial production of our first mine less than two years ago 
our activities to date have been focused on raising financing  exploring our properties and preparing for production at the el aguila project 
our mill at the el aguila project is still optimizing production and we are presently processing ore using only the flotation circuit of the mill 
we face all of the risks commonly encountered by other businesses that lack an established operating history  including the need for additional capital and personnel  and intense competition 
there is no assurance that our business plan will be successful 

table of contents the construction of our underground mine and optimization and continued operation of our mill are subject to all of the risks inherent in construction  start up and operations 
these risks include potential delays  cost overruns  shortages of material or labor  construction defects  breakdowns and injuries to persons and property 
we expect to engage a combination of american and mexican subcontractors and material suppliers in connection with the continued development of the el aguila project 
while we anticipate taking all measures which we deem reasonable and prudent in connection with construction of the underground mine and the operation of the mill  there is no assurance that the risks described above will not cause delays or cost overruns in connection with such construction or operation 
any delays would postpone our anticipated receipt of revenue and adversely affect our operations  which in turn may adversely affect the price of our stock 
our underground mining operations are subject to unique risks 
the exploration for minerals and the development and production of mining operations from an underground mine involve a high level of risk and are often affected by hazards outside of our control 
some of these risks include  but are not limited to  underground fires or floods  fall of ground accidents  seismic activity and unexpected geological formations or conditions including noxious fumes or gases 
the occurrence of one or more of these events in connection with our exploration  development  or production activities may result in the death of  or personal injury to  our employees  other personnel or third parties  the loss of mining equipment  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or production facilities  monetary losses  deferral or unanticipated fluctuations in production  environmental damage and potential legal liabilities  all of which may adversely affect our reputation  business  prospects  results of operations and financial position 
our operations are subject to permitting requirements which could require us to delay  suspend or terminate our operations 
our operations  including our ongoing exploration drilling program and production at the el aguila project  require permits from the mexican government 
if we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits  or if there is a delay in receiving future permits  our timetable and business plan will be adversely affected 
our properties are located in mexico and are subject to changes in political conditions and regulations in that country 
all of our existing properties are located in mexico 
in the past  mexico has been subject to political and social instability  changes and uncertainties which may cause changes to existing government regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities 
our mineral exploration and mining activities in mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing governmental regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties 
finally  mexico s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain required financing for our projects 
our business operations may be adversely affected by social and political unrest in oaxaca or by violence and crime in mexico 
our existing properties are all located in the state of oaxaca  mexico 
oaxaca city  the capital of the state of oaxaca  experienced a period of social and political unrest in certain civilian groups seeking political reform staged protests and demonstrations in various locations in oaxaca city  including schools  government offices and major roadways 
our business operations could be negatively impacted if oaxaca or other areas of mexico experiences another similar event 
additionally  various areas in mexico are impacted by increasing violence and crime which may lead local residents to resist cooperating with the federal government and outside organizations and also to an increased military presence in those areas 
our operating activities may be interrupted if we are unable to hire qualified personnel or if we are denied access to the site where our properties are located due to social unrest or increased violence and crime 
we may also be required to make additional expenditures to provide increased security in order to protect property or personnel located at our properties 
significant delays in exploration or increases in expenditures will likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in legislation affecting the mining industry could significantly affect our operations 
as in other countries  legislation has been introduced in mexico which would impose a royalty on production from mineral properties 
in the event any such legislation was successfully passed and signed into law  it could significantly and adversely affect our results of operations 
we do not insure against all of the risks to which we may be subject in our operations 
while we currently maintain insurance against general commercial liability claims and the physical assets at our el aguila project  we do not maintain insurance to cover all of the potential risks associated with our operations 
we might be subject to liability for environmental  pollution or other hazards associated with mineral exploration and development  which risks may not be insured against  which may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage  or which we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
we may also not be insured against interruptions to our operations 
losses from these or other events may cause us to incur significant costs which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our property 
a significant loss could force us to reduce or terminate our operations 

table of contents our ability to develop our property is subject to the rights of the ejido local inhabitants to use the surface for agricultural purposes 
our ability to mine minerals is subject to maintaining satisfactory arrangements with the ejido for access and surface disturbances 
ejidos are groups of local inhabitants who were granted rights to conduct agricultural activities on the property 
we must negotiate and maintain a satisfactory arrangement with these residents in order to disturb or discontinue their rights to farm 
while we have successfully negotiated and signed such agreements related to the el aguila project  our inability to maintain these agreements or consummate similar agreements for new projects could impair or impede our ability to successfully mine the properties 
competition in the mining industry is intense  and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete 
competition in the mining industry for desirable properties  investment capital and personnel is intense 
numerous companies headquartered in the united states  canada and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties on a global basis 
we are an insignificant participant in the gold mining industry due to our limited financial and personnel resources 
we presently operate with a limited number of personnel and we anticipate that we will compete with other companies in our industry to hire additional qualified personnel which will be required to successfully operate our mine and mill site 
we may be unable to attract the necessary investment capital or personnel to fully explore and if warranted  develop our properties and be unable to acquire other desirable properties 
we may require significant additional capital to fund our business plan 
we will be required to expend significant funds to determine if proven and probable mineral reserves exist at any of our properties  to continue exploration and if warranted  develop our existing properties and to identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our property portfolio 
we have spent and will be required to continue to expend significant amounts of capital for drilling  geological and geochemical analysis  assaying and feasibility studies with regard to the results of our exploration 
we may not benefit from these investments if we are unable to identify commercially exploitable mineralized material 
if we do locate commercially mineable material or decide to put additional properties into production  we may be required to upgrade our milling facility at the el aguila project or construct new facilities 
our ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes  in turn  depends upon a number of factors  including the status of the national and worldwide economy and the price of gold and other precious metals 
capital markets worldwide have been adversely affected by substantial losses by financial institutions  in turn caused by investments in asset backed securities 
we may not be successful in obtaining the required financing  or if we can obtain such financing  such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us 
failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further mining operations or exploration and development and the possible partial or total loss of our potential interest in our properties 
since most of our expenses are paid in mexican pesos  and we sell our production in united states dollars  we are subject to adverse changes in currency values that may adversely affect our results of operation 
our operations in the future could be affected by changes in the value of the mexican peso against the united states dollar 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies such as the peso against the us dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in us dollar terms in mexico  which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows 
conversely  depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
our activities are subject to significant environmental regulations  which could raise the cost of doing business or adversely affect our ability to develop our properties 
our mining operations are subject to environmental regulation by semarnat  the environmental protection agency of mexico 
regulations governing development of new projects or significant changes to existing projects require that an environmental impact statement  known in mexico as a manifiestacion de impacto ambiental  be prepared by a third party contractor for submission to semarnat 
studies required to support this impact statement include a detailed analysis of many subject areas  including soil  water  vegetation  wildlife  cultural resources and socio economic impacts 
we may also be required to submit proof of local community support for a project to obtain final approval 
if an environmental impact statement is adverse or if we cannot obtain community support  our ability to develop our properties could be adversely affected 
significant environmental legislation exists in mexico  including fines and penalties for spills  release of emissions into the air  seepage and other environmental damage  which fines or penalties could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation 
the nature of mineral exploration and production activities involves a high degree of risk and the possibility of uninsured losses 
exploration for and the production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses 
many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization  and any mineralization 
table of contents discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined 
our operations are  and any future development or mining operations we may conduct will be  subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and development of mineral properties  such as  but not limited to economically insufficient mineralized material  fluctuation in production costs that make mining uneconomical  labor disputes  unanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems  environmental hazards  water conditions  difficult surface or underground conditions  industrial accidents  metallurgic and other processing problems  mechanical and equipment performance problems  failure of pit walls or dams  unusual or unexpected rock formations  personal injury  fire  flooding  cave ins and landslides  and decrease in the value of mineralized material due to lower gold and silver prices 
any of these risks can materially and adversely affect  among other things  the development of properties  production quantities and rates  costs and expenditures  potential revenues and production dates 
we currently have limited insurance to guard against some of these risks 
if we determine that capitalized costs associated with any of our mineral interests are not likely to be recovered  we would incur a writedown of our investment in these interests 
all of these factors may result in losses in relation to amounts spent which are not recoverable  or result in additional expenses 
we depend upon a limited number of personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business 
if any of our current executive employees or our principal financial consultant were to die  become disabled or leave our company  we would be forced to identify and retain individuals to replace them 
messrs 
william  david and jason reid  and mr 
juan manuel flores are our critical employees at this time 
paul e 
oberman is a financial consultant who provides services to us as chief financial officer 
there is no assurance that we can find suitable individuals to replace them or to add to our employee base if that becomes necessary 
we are entirely dependent on these individuals as our critical personnel at this time 
we have no life insurance on any individual  and we may be unable to hire a suitable replacement for them on favorable terms  should that become necessary 
in the event of a dispute regarding title to our property or any facet of our operations  it will likely be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in mexico  where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures 
the resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming  similar to the situation in the united states 
however  in a foreign country  we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures 
we may not be entitled to a jury trial  as we might be in the united states 
further  to litigate in any foreign country  we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws 
for these reasons  we may incur unforeseen losses if we are forced to resolve a dispute in mexico or any other foreign country 
we are required to annually evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to furnish a report by our management on internal control over financial reporting 
such a report must contain  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management 
in addition  our evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal controls will be subject to an annual audit by our independent registered public accounting firm and there is no assurance that they will agree with our assessment 
if we are unable to maintain and to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  or if we disclose material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  or if our independent registered public accounting firm does not agree with our assessment  you could lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 

table of contents the laws of the state of colorado and our articles of incorporation may protect our directors from certain types of lawsuits 
the laws of the state of colorado provide that our directors will not be liable to us or our shareholders for monetary damages for all but certain types of conduct as directors of the company 
our articles of incorporation permit us to indemnify our directors and officers against all damages incurred in connection with our business to the fullest extent provided or allowed by law 
the exculpation provisions may have the effect of preventing shareholders from recovering damages against our directors caused by their negligence  poor judgment or other circumstances 
the indemnification provisions may require us to use our limited assets to defend our directors and officers against claims  including claims arising out of their negligence  poor judgment  or other circumstances 
risks related to our common stock our stock price may be volatile and as a result you could lose all or part of your investment 
in addition to volatility associated with equity securities in general  the value of your investment could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock changes in the worldwide price for gold  disappointing results from our exploration or production efforts  producing at rates lower than those targeted  weather conditions  including unusually heavy rains  failure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget  decline in demand for our common stock  downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions  technological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies  investor perception of our industry or our prospects  and general economic trends 
in the last months  the price of our stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
in addition  stock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of securities have been highly volatile 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as a result  you may be unable to resell your shares at a desired price 
the sale of common stock by certain of our shareholders may depress the price of our common stock due to the limited trading market which exists 
due to a number of factors  including our stage of development and the past history of our common stock trading in the over the counter securities market prior to becoming listed on a national securities exchange  the trading volume in our common stock has been limited 
trading over the last days has averaged approximately  shares per day 
the sale of a significant amount of common stock by our principal shareholders  including hochschild mining holdings limited  may depress the price of our common stock 
as a result  you may lose all or a part of your investment 
a small number of existing shareholders own a significant amount of our common stock  which could limit your ability to influence the outcome of any shareholder vote 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own approximately of our common stock and our largest shareholder owns approximately of our common stock as of february  under our articles of incorporation and colorado law  the vote of a majority of the shares outstanding is generally required to approve most shareholder action 
as a result  this group may be able to influence the outcome of shareholder votes for the foreseeable future  including votes concerning the election of directors  amendments to our articles of incorporation or proposed mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
we have no existing agreements or plans for mergers or other corporate transactions that would require a shareholder vote at this time 
however  you should be aware that you may have limited ability to influence the outcome of any vote in the future 
we are subject to the continued listing criteria of the nyse amex and our failure to satisfy these criteria may result in delisting of our common stock 
our common stock is currently listed on the nyse amex 
in order to maintain the listing  we must maintain certain share prices  financial and share distribution targets  including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders equity and a minimum number of public shareholders 
in addition to objective standards  the nyse amex may delist the securities of any issuer if  in its opinion  the issuer s financial condition and or operating results appear unsatisfactory  if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the nyse amex inadvisable  if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company  if an issuer fails to comply with the nyse amex s listing requirements  if an issuer s common stock sells at what the nyse amex considers a low selling price and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the nyse amex  or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the nyse amex  in its opinion  inadvisable 

table of contents if the nyse amex delists our common stock  investors may face material adverse consequences  including  but not limited to  a lack of trading market for our securities  reduced liquidity  decreased analyst coverage of our securities  and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations 
issuances of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have the authority to issue up to  shares of common stock   shares of preferred stock  and also to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock without stockholder approval 
as of february   there were  shares of common stock outstanding 
future issuances of our securities could be at prices substantially below the price paid for our common stock by our current shareholders 
in addition  we can issue blocks of our common stock in amounts up to of the then outstanding shares without further shareholder approval 
because we experience lower trading volume in our common stock than many of our larger peers  the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may have a disproportionately large impact on our share price compared to larger companies 
past payments of dividends on our common stock are not indictors of future payments of dividends 
as of february   we have declared an instituted cash dividend on our common stock of per share per month 
however  our ability to pay dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors  including cash flow  development requirements and strategies  spot gold and silver prices and taxation and general market conditions 
further  a portion of our cash flow will likely be retained to finance our operations 
any material change in our operations may affect future dividends which may be modified at the discretion of our board of directors

item properties we classify our mineral properties into two categories operating properties and exploration properties 
operating properties are properties on which we operate a producing mine and are what we consider a material property in accordance with guide we currently have an interest in six properties  one operating property and five exploration properties  in the southern state of oaxaca  mexico 
all of the properties except the solaga property are located in what is known as the san jose structural corridor  which runs north west 
our properties comprise continuous kilometers of this structural corridor  which spans three historic mining districts in oaxaca 
the map below shows the general location of our six properties logo 
table of contents operating properties the el aguila project background effective october   we leased three mining concessions from a former consultant to our company known as el aguila  el aire and la tehuana  which totaled  hectares 
the el aguila and el aire concessions are part of the el aguila project and the la tehuana concession comprises the las margaritas property 
the el aguila lease agreement with our former consultant is subject to a net smelter return royalty where production is sold in the form of gold silver dore and for production sold in concentrate form 
subject to meeting minimum exploration requirements  there is no expiration term for the lease 
we may terminate it at any time upon written notice to the lessor and the lessor may terminate it if we fail to fulfill any of our obligations  which primarily consists of paying the appropriate royalty to the lessor 
in  we subsequently acquired  at no additional cost  two additional concessions from our former consultant  which we refer to as el chacal and el pilon  totaling  hectares  each of which are subject to a royalty to him  but are not subject to the lease 
we have filed for and received additional concessions for the el aguila project that total an additional  hectares which we refer to as el pitayo  el talaje  el coyote  el zarrito  san luis and la curva 
these additional concessions are also not part of the concessions leased or acquired from our former consultant  and bring our interest in the el aguila project to an aggregate of  hectares 
the mineral concessions making up the el aguila project are located within the san pedro totolapam ejido 
as described in more detail in mining concessions and regulations below  we are required to pay concession fees to the mexican government to maintain our interest in these concessions  including the concessions which are subject to the lease agreement with our former consultant 
we paid approximately  during in maintenance fees to the mexican government for the concessions comprising el aguila project 
location and access the el aguila project is located in the sierra madre del sur mountains of southern mexico  in the central part of the state of oaxaca 
the property is located along a major paved highway approximately kilometers miles southeast of oaxaca city  the state s capital city 
at the village of san jose de gracia  the property is approximately four kilometers due northwest from the village 
we have constructed a gravel road from the village to the mine and mill sites which supports adequate access to the property by small and large vehicles 
the climate of the el aguila project area is dry and warm to very warm with most rainfall occurring in the summer and annual precipitation averaging only mm inches 
the average yearly temperature is degrees centigrade f 
the area is very rocky with scarce vegetation 
subsistence farming occurs and the main agricultural crop is agave cactus that is cultivated for the production of mescal 
geology and mineralization the el aguila project is located in the san jose de gracia mining district in oaxaca 
multiple volcanic domes of various scales  and probably non vented intrusive domes  dominate the district geology 
these volcanogenic features are imposed on a pre volcanic basement of sedimentary rocks 
gold and silver mineralization in this district is related to the manifestations of this classic volcanogenic system and is considered epithermal in character 
there are no known reserves at el aguila and we have proceeded to commercially mine the property absent a feasibility study that would indicate any proven or probable reserves 
as discussed in more detail below  we have produced metal concentrates from two locations on the el aguila property  the open pit mine el aguila open pit and the underground mine at the la arista vein system 
the el aguila open pit mineralization is considered low sulfidation  epithermal mineralization of gold and silver with no base metals 
the la arista vein system is considered intermediate epithermal mineralization of gold  silver  copper  lead  and zinc 
the host rock at the la arista vein system is primarily andesite 

table of contents facilities we constructed a mill facility and infrastructure at the el aguila project for approximately million  which was completed in the mill is flexible in its ability to process several types of mineralization 
it has a differential flotation section capable of processing polymetallic ores and producing up to three separate concentrate products for sale  and an agitated leach circuit capable of producing gold and silver dore for sale 
depending on the specific ore type and characteristics  the mill  as it is presently configured  can process a nominal  tonnes of ore per year 
power is provided by diesel generators at the site 
we obtained water rights from the mexican government for an amount of water we believe is sufficient to meet our operating requirements and pump it approximately five kilometers to the site from a permitted well located near the totolapam river 
additional improvements we have made at the site include constructing an access road from a major highway  installing a water line and pumping station  creating haul roads from the mine site  constructing buildings adjacent to the mill facility for office space and an assay lab and construction of a tailings impoundment and other infrastructure 
in october  we acquired an additional parcel of land which is approximately five hectares in size and adjacent to the community of san jose de gracia 
the land cost us  we have completed construction of an employee housing facility on this parcel for approximately million that includes buildings and houses approximately people 
exploration activities the early history of activity at the el aguila project property  as known by us  is prospecting and limited mining for gold and silver from the early s to the mid s 
in  the concessions were leased to apex silver corporation of denver  colorado 
apex carried out an exploration program involving geologic mapping  surface sampling and an hole drilling program  meters  or  feet 
the results did not meet apex s expectations so it cancelled its lease on the property in we leased the property from our former consultant in october in august  we commenced an initial drilling and exploration program 
through  we have drilled a total of core holes equaling  meters and reverse circulation holes equaling  meters for a total of holes totaling  meters  feet 
exploration at the el aguila project has involved drilling the el aguila open pit mineralization and drilling the el aire vein system mineralization and the discovery and subsequent detailed drilling of the la arista vein system 
the la arista vein system is made up of two primary veins  the baja vein and the arista vein which are approximately meters apart but also include multiple near parallel veins of varying length 
the drilling of the la arista vein system has shown mineralized material over meters of strike length and meters of depth 
both veins are open along strike and depth 
our exploration program at el aguila during and is primarily focused on development work at the la arista vein system and although there is no specific timetable for exploration  development of the vein system remains our highest exploration priority 
we anticipate spending approximately million in for exploration at el aguila  consisting of approximately million for drilling   for geochemical surveys and  for geophysical exploration  including an airborne magnetic survey of all of our properties 
we anticipate that all exploration activities will be funded from working capital 
operating activities we declared commercial production at the el aguila project july  mineral production during consisted of processing ore from the el aguila open pit located approximately kilometers from the mill 
mining of the open pit ore was essentially completed in and there remained a stockpile of open pit ore approximating  tonnes at the end of in  we processed  tonnes of open pit ore with an average grade of grams per tonne gold and grams per tonne silver from this ore through the mill s flotation circuit 
during  we began developing an underground mine to access two veins we named the la arista and baja veins  which we refer to as the la arista vein system 
the underground mine is approximately kilometers from the mill 
we have constructed a primary decline ramp and that reached level  approximately meters below the portal  at december  we have also constructed a safety ventilation decline ramp in conjunction with the primary decline ramp 
in november  we commenced underground mining and stockpiling of the la arista ore at our el aguila project and continue to develop multiple working faces on the veins 
we began the first stope between level and level during and we are mining ore from the stopes between levels and and levels and at december  
table of contents we began transitioning from processing the open pit ore to the underground ore at our mill facilities in march since that time  and especially following an anomalous storm in april which flooded the lower levels of the underground mine  we have periodically processed ore from the open pit stockpile in addition to underground ore to supplement mill throughput 
for approximately six weeks during the cleanup phase following the storm  we were unable to remove ore from the underground mine and supplemented approximately of the mill throughput with stockpiled open pit ore 
in june  we began processing ore from one of the first stopes we encountered and have combined this ore with development ore from la arista 
in  the combined open pit and underground ore that we processed through the mill averaged tonnes of ore per day and totaled  tonnes for the year  with an average grade of grams per tonne gold and grams per tonne silver 
all of our processing is taking place using the mill s flotation circuit  as we have not yet utilized the mill s agitated leach circuit 
we anticipate we would use the agitated leach circuit if ever we are able to mine sufficient ore from the el rey property 
please see the table titled production and sales statistics el aguila project in item management s discussion and analysis for additional details concerning our mineral production statistics for and exploration properties we currently hold an interest in five additional properties in oaxaca  which we classify as exploration properties 
we do not currently consider any of these properties to be a material property for purposes of guide and none of these properties has any known reserves 
we anticipate all exploration activities at these properties will be funded through our working capital 
the el rey property the el rey property consists of concessions in another area in the state of oaxaca known as el rey  el virrey  la reyna and el marquez 
we acquired the el rey concession from our former consultant and it is subject to a net smelter return royalty payable to him 
we obtained the remaining concessions by staking claims and filing for concessions with the mexican government 
these concessions total  hectares and we are required to pay concession maintenance fees semi annually to the mexican government to maintain the claims 
we paid  in maintenance fees for the concessions comprising el rey property in the el rey property is approximately kilometers miles from the el aguila project 
there is no plant or equipment on the el rey property 
if exploration is successful  any mining would probably require an underground mine but any mineralized material could be trucked to the el aguila project mill for processing 
limited drilling at el rey has encountered gold and silver mineralization up to meter of grams per tonne gold ounces per tonne and meters of grams per tonne silver 
the mineralized material has been located within meters from the surface 
to date  we have drilled core holes for a total of  meters  feet at the el rey property 
during  we began to refurbish and extend an existing shaft on the property to permit underground exploratory drilling 
we purchased a hoist and began designing a headframe to use at the shaft to facilitate underground access 
we intend to continue exploration at el rey during and have budgeted million for that purpose  including  for continued work on the existing shaft and  for additional drilling from the surface and underground 
however  we have temporarily ceased work at el rey following a recent request to obtain additional approvals from local community agencies 
we are working with the local agencies and anticipate resolving the matter  but we have no assurance we will be able to resume our exploration activities in the near term 
the las margaritas property the las margaritas property is made up of the la tehuana concession 
we leased this concession in october from our former consultant along with two of the concessions comprising the el aguila property and the terms of this agreement are discussed under the el aguila project above 
it is comprised of approximately hectares located adjacent to the el aguila project 
we are also required to pay concession maintenance fees semi annually to the mexican government to maintain this claim and we paid  in maintenance fees during to date  we have conducted limited surface sampling that has identified mineralization containing up to  grams per tonne silver and grams per tonne gold 
based on these results  we intend to continue exploration activity at las margaritas 
we have budgeted approximately  for additional geophysical and geochemical testing during to 
table of contents continue identifying potential drill targets 
we have obtained permits and completed design work to commence construction of a new access road bypassing the community of las margaritas to allow year round access to the drill targets without being impaced by fluctuating water levels from the nearby river 
we have not established a formal timetable for exploration  however  if we initiate an exploratory drilling program at the property  we would anticipate spending approximately  during the first twelve months on surface drilling 
the solaga property in february  we leased a interest in a property we refer to as the solaga property  which is comprised of two mining concessions totaling hectares known as solaga i and solaga ii 
the property is located approximately kilometers miles northeast of the el aguila project 
the primary term of the lease is for eight years and can be held after that by production 
the lease is subject to a net smelter return royalty on any production 
the lease also requires an annual minimum advance royalty payment of  if production has not commenced by we paid the minimum advance royalty in and to the lessor in accordance with the lease 
we are also required to pay concession maintenance fees semi annually to the mexican government to maintain the claims and we paid  in maintenance fees for solaga during a dormant silver mine is located on the solaga property which was in production as recently as the s 
however  we cannot estimate if or when we will reopen the mine 
we have not conducted any exploration activities at the property and have not established a timetable for exploration 
to the extent we have the personnel and equipment available during  we will commence exploration activities and have budgeted approximately  for that purpose 
we intend to conduct surface sampling and geological mapping at the solaga property  as well as to evaluate whether to rehabilitate the historic workings located at the property 
the alta gracia property in august  we acquired claims adjacent to the las margaritas property in the alta gracia mining district by filing concessions known as the david  the david and la hurradura  totaling  hectares 
we refer to this property as the alta gracia property 
we are required to pay concession maintenance fees to the mexican government semi annually in order to maintain these claims and we paid  in annual fees during during  we conducted surface sampling and geologic mapping at alta gracia 
our rock chip samples and other geologic field work have identified several structural targets containing gold and silver mineralization  including three high grade polymetallic veins that outcrop on the surface near some historic workings 
we believe these results justified further exploration using an exploratory drill program 
during and  we identified multiple drill targets and in drilled shallow exploratory core holes for a total of  meters  feet 
we also conducted a small amount of underground exploration by driving drifts and crosscuts into exposed veins 
initial drill results are encouraging and warrant continued drilling in to test other targets generated from surface sampling and the deeper zones of veins encountered to date 
in  we had intercepts grading over grams silver per tonne from intervals averaging over one meter down hole length 
assays identified mineralization up to grams per tonne silver with grams per tonne gold and only trace amounts of other base metals 
we have no established timetable for our exploration activities at alta gracia  however  we have budgeted approximately million for additional exploration activities in  including  to continue exploratory drilling 
in addition to surface drilling  we intend to develop underground drill stations for deeper exploratory drilling and to test for mineral continuity 
in late and continuing in  we began rehabilitating historic adits located at the site to permit underground access and intend to spend approximately  to complete this work 
the remaining  is budgeted for geophysical and geochemical testing 
the el chamizo property in june  we staked mineral claims between the el rey property and alta gracia property and acquired an exploration concession from the mexican government of approximately  hectares square miles referred to as el chamizo 
we are required to pay maintenance fees to the mexican government semi annually to maintain these claims and during the second half of we paid approximately  in maintenance fees 
because of the close proximity of el chamizo to alta gracia  exploration activity began on this property during late and to date has been limited to geochemical sampling and drilling of eight shallow core holes for a total of  meters  feet 
additional work in will include the property wide airborne geophysical survey and additional geochemical sampling and drilling  which is included in the exploration budget for alta gracia 

table of contents mining concessions and regulations mineral rights in mexico belong to the mexican federal government and are administered pursuant to article of the mexican constitution 
all of our mining concessions are exploitation concessions  which may be granted or transferred to mexican citizens and corporations 
our leases or concessions are held by our mexican subsidiaries 
exploitation concessions have a term of years and can be renewed for another years 
concessions grant us the right to explore and exploit all minerals found in the ground 
maintenance of concessions requires the semi annual payment of mining duties due in january and july and the performance of assessment work  on a calendar year basis  with assessment work reports required to be filed in the month of may for the preceding calendar year 
the amount of mining duties and annual assessment are set by regulation and may increase over the life of the concession and include periodic adjustments for inflation 
mining concessions are registered at the public registry of mining in mexico city and in regional offices in mexico 
mexican mining law does not require payment of finder s fees or royalties to the government  except for a discovery premium in connection with national mineral reserves  concessions and claims or allotments contracted directly from the mexican geological survey 
none of the claims held by any of our subsidiaries are under such a discovery premium regime 
ejido lands and surface right acquisitions surface lands at our oaxaca mining properties are ejido lands agrarian cooperative lands granted by the federal government to groups of campesinos pursuant to article of the mexican constitution of 
prior to january   ejidos could not transfer ejido lands into private ownership 
amendments to article of the mexican constitution in now allow individual property ownership within ejidos and allow ejidos to enter into commercial ventures with individuals or entities  including foreign corporations 
we have an agreement with the local san pedro totolapam ejido allowing exploration and exploitation of mineralization at the el aguila project and our surrounding properties 
mexican law recognizes mining as a land use generally superior to agricultural 
however  the law also recognizes the rights of the ejidos to compensation in the event mining activity interrupts or discontinues their use of the agricultural lands 
compensation is typically made in the form of a cash payment to the holder of the agricultural rights 
the amount of such compensation is generally related to the perceived value of the agricultural rights as negotiated in the first instance between the ejidos and the owner of the mineral rights 
if the parties are unable to reach agreement on the amount of the compensation  the decision will be referred to the government 
we have established surface rights agreements with the san pedro totolapam ejido and the individuals impacted by our proposed operations which allow disturbance of the surface where necessary for our exploration activities and mining operations 
office facilities we constructed an administrative office building adjacent to the mill site as part of the facilities at the el aguila project 
in  we purchased a building in colorado springs  colorado  containing approximately  square feet which serves as our executive and administrative headquarters

table of contents introduction the following discussion analyzes our operating results for the three fiscal years ended december  and our financial condition at december  and  with a particular emphasis on the year ended december  overview business we are a mining company that pursues gold and silver projects that we anticipate will feature low operating costs and high returns on capital and is currently focused on mineral production at the el aguila project in oaxaca  mexico 
we began commercial production of metal concentrates in july from the el aguila open pit mine 
we experienced our first full year of operations in during the first two months of  we processed ore from our el aguila open pit mine where our primary metal product was gold and our by product was silver 
for the remaining ten months of  we processed ore primarily from our underground la arista mine where our primary metal products are gold and silver and our by products are copper  lead and zinc  although we briefly supplemented approximately of our production with stockpiled open pit ore during the clean up period following an anomalous storm in april for the year ended december   we recorded revenues of million  mine gross profit of million  net income before extraordinary item of million and net income of million 
we produced a total of  ounces gold equivalent for the twelve months ended december  at a cash cost of per gold equivalent ounce 
precious metal gold equivalent is determined by taking the silver payable metal ounces produced and converting them to the dollar equivalent of gold by using the gold to silver average price ratio 
the gold and silver average prices used are the actual metal prices realized from the sales of our metals concentrate 
please see the section titled non gaap measure below for additional information concerning the cash cost per ounce measure 
exploration stage company we are considered an exploration stage company under the sec criteria since we have not demonstrated the existence of proven or probable reserves at our el aguila project in oaxaca  mexico or any of our other properties 
accordingly  as required by the sec guidelines see note to the consolidated financial statements and us gaap for companies in the exploratory stage  substantially all of our investment in mining properties to date  including construction of the mill and mines  have been expensed and therefore do not appear as assets on our balance sheet 
we therefore also expensed construction and development expenditures in related to the la arista underground mine 
certain expenditures  such as expenses for rolling stock or other general purpose equipment  may be capitalized  subject to our evaluation of the possible impairment of the asset 
our characterization as an exploration stage company regarding the treatment of construction and development expenditures as an operating expense rather than as a capital expenditure  has caused us to report larger losses in and and lower net income in than if we had capitalized the expenditures 
additionally  we will not have a corresponding depreciation or amortization expense for these costs going forward since they are expensed as incurred rather than capitalized 
although the majority of the capital expenditures for the el aguila project were completed between and  we expect underground mine construction to continue in future years 
in comparison to other mining companies that capitalize development expenditures because they have exited the exploration stage  we may report larger losses or lesser profits as a result of this ongoing construction  which will be expensed instead of capitalized for accounting purposes 
we expect to remain as an exploration stage company for the foreseeable future  even though we have reached commercial production 
we will not exit the exploration stage until such time  if ever  that we demonstrate the existence of proven or probable reserves that meet the sec guidelines 
likewise  unless mineralized material is classified as proven or probable reserves  substantially all expenditures for mine and mill construction have been or will be expensed as incurred 
exploration activities during  we focused primarily on infill and step out drilling at the la arista underground mine  located at the el aguila project 
because this drilling is actually used to define the mineralization and to assist in mining of the ore at the underground mine  these expenses are considered development and delineation of the ore body not exploration  and these costs are accounted for under construction and development 
exploration activities that are expensed as exploration expenses are activities that consist of  but are not limited to  drilling on the balance of the property to test new geologic targets 
at the el rey property we intend to conduct further exploration from underground by draining and refurbishing an existing shaft for access and to sink the shaft deeper to enable us 
table of contents to explore the previously drilled veins by drifting  crosscutting and establishing underground drill stations  once the refurbishment is complete 
we expect to test mine some of the veins and generate bulk samples for metallurgical testing purposes 
we are also exploring and testing at the alta gracia property by drilling from the surface and driving drifts and crosscuts into exposed veins 
other events in august  we began purchasing gold and silver bullion to diversify our treasury and for possible use in conjunction with a program to offer shareholders the ability to receive gold and silver bullion in lieu of cash payment of dividends 
it is expected that the bullion will be minted into coins in connection with this program 
during the year ended december   we purchased approximately ounces of gold and  ounces of silver at market prices for a total cost of million 
on august   the board of directors instituted a regular dividend payment of per share per month  or per share per year  beginning with the august dividend payable in september prior to instituting a regular dividend  the dividends were characterized as special dividends 
special dividends have been declared each month since we commenced commercial production on july  and we moved to institute a regular dividend based on our performance in the latter part of the dividends have been charged against our additional paid in capital and were considered return of capital dividend since gold resource corporation  as a stand alone us corporation  had no current or accumulated tax basis earnings or profits in and on september   the board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to million of our common stock from time to time in market transactions 
there is no pre determined end date associated with the share repurchase program 
as of december   we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales of metals concentrate  net during the year ended december   we generated revenues of million  net of treatment charges  compared to revenues of million during the same period of  an increase of 
as mentioned previously  was our first full year of commercial production  while production in was limited to six months 
also  metals prices realized in increased over the prior year  with average per ounce gold prices increasing to  from  per ounce  a increase  and average per ounce silver prices increasing to from per ounce  a increase 
metal concentrate sales during were generated only from the el aguila open pit mine  for  metal concentrate sales were derived from the el aguila open pit mine during the first two months of the year and substantially from the la arista underground mine for the remaining ten months of the year 
the table below sets forth the production and sales statistics from the el aguila project for and this table includes a break down in the production statistics by mine for which production and sales from the el aguila open pit mine occurred during the first two months of  and compares those results to our six months of commercial production during july december from the el aguila open pit mine 
this table also sets forth production and sales statistics from the la arista underground mine for march through december there are no comparable statistics for for the la arista underground mine

for the year ended december   we sold  ounces gold and  ounces silver from the el aguila project compared to  ounces gold and  ounces silver during from the el aguila open pit mine  we sold  ounces gold and  ounces silver produced during the first two months of  our sales during were derived solely from the el aguila open pit mine 
from the la arista underground mine  we sold  ounces gold and  ounces silver during the remaining ten months of production during from the underground mine resulted in 
table of contents improved metal recoveries which was supported by increase in the average metal prices realized compared to we also generated revenues in from sales of base metal concentrates copper  lead and zinc which are derived from and are considered by products of our gold and silver production 
production for the year ended december   we produced  gold equivalent ounces compared to  gold ounces for the same period of see the table titled production and sales statistics el aguila project above for additional information regarding our mineral production statistics 
we continue to focus mining and development activities at the la arista underground mine and our production is dependent on the rate of mine development and the establishment of sufficient stopes and working faces 
we anticipate the number of stopes and working faces will increase in and that production will increase as well 
we are targeting production of  to  ounces gold equivalent in mine gross profit 
for the year ended december   mine gross profit  which is equal to net revenue minus costs of production including depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  the significant increase in mine gross profit from the prior year was primarily due to the increase in sales of metal concentrate  at higher metal prices realized  as discussed above 
mine gross profit percentages for the year ended december  increased to from during the same period in net income loss before extraordinary item 
for the year ended december   net income before extraordinary item was million  or per diluted share  as compared to a net loss before extraordinary item of million or per diluted share  for the comparable period of net income before extraordinary item for the year ended december  was driven by the fact that we generated significantly more revenue from the sale of precious metals and base metals in the period combined with increased mine gross profit margins and the income tax benefit for a reduction to the income tax valuation allowance 
we commenced commercial production in july and did not record revenue during the first six months of costs and expenses 
total costs and expenses during the year ended december  were million compared to million during the comparable period of  an increase of million  or 
this increase in costs and expenses  which are discussed by category below  was primarily the result of our operations transitioning to our underground mine development activities and an increase in stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses  exclusive of stock based compensation  for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same periods of the cash components of general and administrative expense include salaries and benefits  professional fees  investor relations  community relations and travel 
the change in general and administrative expenses was attributable to increases in community relations  professional fees  and salaries and benefits 
the increase during the year ended december  principally reflects the transition to an operating mining company  principally in the areas of increased mexican operations and corporate management and personnel costs and supporting professional services 
for the year ended december   stock based compensation a non cash expense increased million compared to the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the fair value of stock option grants is then amortized and expensed over the respective vesting period 
the fair value of options granted or vested during the year ended december  was million compared to million in this increase resulted from the issuance of additional stock options during the periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
exploration expenses 
property exploration expenses totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million during the same period of the exploration expenses for year ended december  has not changed materially from the comparable period of the exploration program continues consistent with the targeted drilling activity planned at our properties 
we anticipate spending approximately million for exploration in  including a combined million for all exploration properties  which excludes el aguila 
construction and development expenses 
construction and development expenses during the year ended december  increased to million from million during as mentioned previously  our expenses relating to development drilling and construction of the la arista underground mine are categorized as construction and development expenses 
during  we also completed the second phase of the tailings dam  and expanded the capacity of the cleaner flotation cells in the flotation circuit 
we will continue to focus on further development of la arista for the foreseeable future 

table of contents other income expense 
for the year ended december   we recorded other income of million  compared to other expense of million during the same period of the change in other income expense resulted primarily from recognizing a currency exchange gain of million during the year ended december  compared to a currency exchange loss of million in the comparable period in the current year gains resulted from currency translation adjustments during a period when the dollar was declining compared to the mexican peso 
we also incurred an unrealized loss of million resulting from the fair market value adjustment to gold and silver bullion held 
income tax benefit expense 
for the year ended december   income tax benefit was million compared to nil for the same period in the income tax benefit is principally comprised of a reduction in the valuation allowances of our mexican subsidiary  don david gold  and the us parent totaling million  or per diluted share  and a current income tax expense of don david gold of million after the utilization of the previously existing net operating loss carry forward of million 
there was no corresponding income tax provision during the period 
the deferred tax benefit and expense of golden trump resources was fully offset by changes in the valuation reserve 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
extraordinary item 
on april   the el aguila project suffered severe damage from an anomalous rain and hail storm which flooded the la arista underground mine and damaged existing roads  buildings and equipment 
we experienced a loss of million  for which we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  net of income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   we sold  ounces of gold at an average price of  per ounce for million of revenue  net of smelter treatment charges  and  ounces of silver at an average price of per ounce for approximately million of revenue  net of smelter treatment charges 
we had mine gross profit of million for the year ended december  there were no comparable sales of precious metals in for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our net loss decreased in compared to as a result of generating revenues for the first time at the el aguila project in total costs and expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the comparable period of  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in costs and expenses was primarily due to operations shifting from construction activities to production activities consistent with commencing commercial production during the property exploration expense component for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from the comparable period of  from million to million 
the decrease reflected our focus on establishing commercial production and the resulting decrease in exploration activities 
the construction and development cost component for the year ended december   decreased million  or  from the comparable period of  from million to million 
the decrease reflected our completed engineering and construction of the open pit mine and mill and a corresponding shift in our construction emphasis to the underground la arista mine development and production 
general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable period in this cash component of the increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits attributable to an increase in the number of employees in mexico  changes to our executive employment agreements and increased professional fees relating to our financing transaction and nyse amex listing 
the component of general and administrative expense of non cash stock based compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in for the years ended december  and  we recorded a currency translation adjustment gain of  and a currency translation adjustment loss of  respectively 
non gaap measures throughout this report  we have provided information prepared or calculated according to us gaap  as well as provided some us gaap non gaap performance measures 
because the non gaap performance measures are not calculated in accordance with us gaap  they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies 

table of contents accordingly  these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance calculated in accordance with us gaap 
cash cost per gold equivalent ounce we use cash operating cost per gold ounce or gold equivalent ounce excluding royalty  calculated in accordance with the gold institute s standard  as one indicator for comparative monitoring of our mining operations from period to period and believe that investors also find this information helpful when evaluating our performance 
in accordance with the gold institute standard  the cash operating cost is arrived at by taking our mine cost of sales and adding treatment charges paid to the buyer of the metals concentrate  subtracting by product credits earned from all metals other than the primary precious metals produced  and subtracting depreciation expense  accretion expense  and royalty payments 
we have reconciled cash operating cost per gold equivalent ounce to reported us gaap measures in the table below 
the most comparable financial measures to our cash operating cost calculated in accordance with us gaap are cost of sales 
mine cost of sales is derived from amounts included in the consolidated statements of operations 
the following summary of our cash operating costs for the year ended december  and was calculated in accordance with the gold institute standard and begins with our mine cost of sales in accordance with us gaap as noted below year ended december  in thousands  except gold equivalent ounces and per gold equivalent ounce gold equivalent ounces produced cost of sales production costs treatment charges by product credits depreciation costs accretion costs royalties cash operating cost cash operating cost per gold equivalent ounce liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  consisting of current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
this represents an increase of million from the working capital balance of million as of december  at december   our sources of working capital included cash on hand and cash generated by operations 
consistent with our plans  our working capital balance fluctuates as we use cash to fund our operations  including exploration and mine development and construction  and to pay income taxes and dividends 
prior to achieving profitable operations  we have historically relied on equity financings to fund our operations 
since achieving profitability in  we do not currently anticipate raising additional equity financing in the foreseeable future 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
our most significant expenditures during were costs associated with the optimization of commercial production at our mill facility  improvements at our mill  the continued construction and development of the underground mine and further exploration of our properties and dividends paid to shareholders 
our significant expenditures for are projected to be further construction and development at the underground mine  increased exploration activities and dividends 
the balance of cash and equivalents as of december  increased to million from million as of december   a net increase in cash of million 
during this period  we converted approximately million of our treasury into physical gold and silver bullion and initiated a share buyback program pursuant to which we repurchased shares of our common stock totaling approximately million 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operating activities of million during the comparable period in our operating cash increased significantly in the period as a result of generating higher revenue and net income during the period compared to a net loss during the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was the result of equipment purchases in our exploration  construction and development activities and purchases of gold and silver bullion 
although most of our exploration stage expenditures are recorded as an expense rather than an investment  we capitalize the acquisition cost of land and mineral rights and certain equipment that has alternative future uses or significant salvage value  including rolling stock  furniture  and electronics  and the cost of these capitalized assets is reflected in our investing activities 
much of the cash provided by our investing activities during the period came from the release of restricted cash  the use of which had previously been specifically designated for exploration  construction and development activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  consisting of dividends declared and treasury stock purchases 
during the comparable period in  cash provided by financing activities was million  consisting of proceeds from the sale of common stock  partially offset by dividends declared of million 
in august  we instituted a regular monthly dividend consisting of per share payable until such time as the board of directors determines otherwise 
as a result and based on the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the date of this report  we anticipate we will continue paying dividends aggregating approximately million each quarter  however  the board of directors may re evaluate its decision on the basis of changes in our operations 
the estimated aggregate amount of dividends we intend to pay may also be reduced in the future if there are significant purchases of common stock under our share repurchase program as the outstanding shares of common stock would be reduced 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations our known obligations at fiscal year end december   are set forth in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands purchase obligations employee salary compensation total represents amounts due to our executive officers pursuant to their respective employment agreements with our company 
represents amounts due to non executive employees pursuant to their respective employment agreements with our company 
critical accounting policies we believe that application of the following accounting policies  which are critical to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 

table of contents use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates that are critical to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include  but are not limited to  the identification and valuation of proven and probable reserves  valuation of gold and silver bullion  valuation of accounts receivable for metal concentrates  valuation of ore and concentrate inventories  recoverability of prepaid expenses  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  estimates related to asset impairments of long lived assets and investments  classification of expenditures as either an asset or an expense  stock based compensation expense  valuation of deferred tax assets  and the likelihood of loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are revised periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period it is determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
proven and probable reserves the definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in sec industry guide proven reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in addition  reserves cannot be considered proven and probable until they are supported by a feasibility study  indicating that the reserves have had the requisite geologic  technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable at the time of the reserve determination 
mineral acquisition costs the costs of acquiring land and mineral rights are considered tangible assets 
significant acquisition payments are capitalized 
general  administrative and holding costs to maintain an exploration property are expensed as incurred 
if a mineable ore body is discovered  such costs are amortized when production begins using the units of production method 
if no mineable ore body is discovered or such rights are otherwise determined to have diminished value  such costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made 
exploration costs exploration costs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs to identify new mineral resources  to evaluate potential resources  and to convert mineral resources into proven and probable reserves are considered exploration costs 
design  construction  and development costs certain costs to design and construct mine and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven and probable reserves 
under these circumstances  we classify the el aguila project as an exploration stage project and expense substantially all costs  including design  engineering  construction  and installation of equipment 
certain types of equipment  which have alternative uses or significant salvage value  may be capitalized 
if a project is determined to contain proven and probable reserves  costs incurred in anticipation of production can be capitalized 
such costs include development drilling to further delineate the ore body  removing overburden during the pre production phase  building access ways  constructing facilities  and installing equipment 
interest costs  if any  incurred during the development phase  would be capitalized until the assets are ready for their intended use 
the cost of start up activities and on going costs to maintain production are expensed as incurred 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
if a project commences commercial production and the project is determined to contain proven and probable reserves  amortization and depletion of capitalized costs is computed on a unit of production basis over the expected reserves of the project based on estimated recoverable gold equivalent ounces 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
if impairment indicators exist  we perform additional analysis to quantify the amount by which capitalized costs exceed recoverable value 
the periodic evaluation of capitalized costs is based upon expected future cash flows  including estimated salvage values 
as of december   our mineral resources do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven and probable reserves and any potential revenue has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions 
accordingly  recoverability of capitalized cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values  or alternative future uses 
property and equipment all items of property and equipment are carried at cost not in excess of their estimated net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings while expenditures for major maintenance and betterments are capitalized 
gains or losses on disposition are recognized in operations 
asset retirement obligation our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations  including legal and contractual obligations to reclaim  remediate  or otherwise restore properties at the time the property is removed from service 
a liability is initially recorded at the estimated present value for an obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
for exploration stage properties that do not qualify for asset capitalization  the costs associated with the obligation are charged to operations 
for development and production stage properties  the costs are added to the capitalized costs of the property and amortized using the unit of production method 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense for the fair value of stock options that are granted 
expense is recognized on a pro rata basis over the vesting periods  if any  of the options 
the fair value of stock options at their grant date is estimated by using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
foreign currency translation the local currency where our properties are located  the mexican peso  is the functional currency for our subsidiaries 
assets and liabilities are translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
intercompany equity accounts are translated using historical rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the year 
translation adjustments are not included in the determination of net loss for the period and are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity 
income taxes income taxes are computed using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and the effect of net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets are evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances have been established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets in recognition of significant uncertainties regarding their ultimate realization 
further  the evaluation has determined that there are no uncertain tax positions required to be disclosed 
recently adopted accounting standards we evaluate the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations  primarily the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec  and the emerging issues task force eitf  to determine the impact of new pronouncements on us gaap and the impact on the company 
we have adopted the following new accounting standards during accounting standards update asu no 
 was issued in january  and clarifies existing disclosures of inputs and valuation techniques for level and fair value measurements 
the disclosure of activity within level fair value measurements was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
there was no impact to our financial position or results of operations for the additional disclosure requirements in asu no 
was issued in april  and clarifies the classification of an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying security trades 
this asu was effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
the impact to our financial position and results of operations for the adoption of this guidance was immaterial 

table of contents asu was issued in december and requires a public entity to disclose pro forma information for business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period 
the disclosures include pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity for the current reporting period as though the acquisition date for all business combinations that occurred during the year had been as of the beginning of the annual reporting period 
this asu was effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  there was no impact to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of adopting this guidance 
recently issued accounting standards updates the following accounting standards updates were recently issued and have not yet been adopted by us 
these standards are currently under review to determine their impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between us gaap and ifrs 
asu also expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
this new guidance is to be applied prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we anticipate that the adoption of this standard will not materially expand its consolidated financial statement footnote disclosures or have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
this accounting update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity 
instead  we must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income which contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu will be effective for public companies during the interim and annual periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the provisions of asu with no impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as it only required a change in the format of the current presentation 
there were various other updates recently issued  most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries 
none of the updates are expected to a have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  equity price risks  commodity price fluctuations  and country risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk  however  we may consider such arrangements in the future as we evaluate our business and financial strategy 
commodity price risk the results of our operations will depend in large part upon the market prices of gold and silver 
gold and silver prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control 
the level of interest rates  the rate of inflation  
table of contents the world supply of gold and silver and the stability of exchange rates  among other factors  can all cause significant fluctuations in commodity prices 
such external economic factors are in turn influenced by changes in international investment patterns  monetary systems and political developments 
the price of gold and silver has fluctuated widely in recent years  and future price declines could cause a mineral project to become uneconomic  thereby having a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we have not entered into derivative contracts to protect the selling price for gold or silver 
we may in the future more actively manage our exposure through derivative contracts or other commodity price risk management programs  although we have no intention of doing so in the near term 
in addition to adversely affecting our mineralized material estimates and our financial condition  declining gold and silver prices could require a reassessment of the feasibility of a particular project 
even if a project is ultimately determined to be economically viable  the need to conduct such a reassessment may cause delays in the implementation of a project 
foreign currency risk we transact a significant amount of our business in mexican pesos 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies such as the peso against the us dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in us dollar terms in mexico  which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in us dollar terms 
the value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
we have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we also hold portions of our cash reserves in non us dollar currencies 
provisional sales contract risk we enter into concentrate sales contracts with third party smelters 
the contracts  in general  provide for a provisional payment based upon provisional assays and quoted metal prices 
the provisionally priced sales contracts contain an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from the sale of concentrates at the forward price at the time of sale 
the embedded derivative  which is the final settlement based on a future price  does not qualify for hedge accounting and is marked to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement 
at december   we had outstanding provisionally priced sales of million consisting of  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver  tons of copper  tons of lead and  tons of zinc which had a fair value of approximately million including the embedded derivative 
if the price for each metal were to change by one percent  the change plus or minus in the total fair value of the concentrates sold would be approximately  at december   we had outstanding provisionally priced sales of million consisting of  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver  which had a fair value of approximately million including the embedded derivative 
if the price for each metal were to change by one percent  the change plus or minus in the total fair value of the concentrates sold would be approximately  interest rate risk we have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time 
equity price risk we have in the past sought and may in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common stock and other equity 
movements in the price of our common stock have been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell our common stock at an acceptable price should the need for new equity funding arise 

table of contents country risk all of our mineral properties are located in mexico 
in the past  that country has been subject to political instability  changes and uncertainties which may cause changes to existing government regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities 
civil or political unrest could disrupt our operations at any time 
our exploration and mining activities may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that could increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties 
finally  mexico s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain required financing for our properties
