item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is the nation s largest provider of assisted living and alzheimer s memory care services 
as of december   we operated senior living communities in states 
fiscal in review emeritus results for fiscal reflect the resiliency of our business model  the needs driven nature of our primarily assisted living business and the talent and dedication of our employees 
our business has performed well this year despite the ongoing economic downturn 
we continued to execute our business strategy  which includes acquisitions  as discussed in detail in 
business business strategy  in this form k 
our business fundamentals remain consistent  as evidenced by growth in revenue  revenue per unit  and average occupancy rate in our same community portfolio as defined below under 
same community portfolio 
in  total operating revenues increased to billion from billion in and million in operating income from continuing operations was million in compared to million in and million in we recorded a net loss attributable to our common shareholders of million in compared to net losses of million in and million in positive cash flows generated by operating activities amounted to million in compared to million in and million in looking ahead to the united states economy remains sluggish and we cannot predict future economic conditions or their impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  we continue to believe that the needs driven nature of our business  potential pent up demand and reduced supply of new senior housing construction in our sector will support improved operating performance  especially if combined with economic recovery 
for  we expect moderate revenue growth driven by increased same community portfolio revenues and community acquisitions that will reflect a full year of revenue in we expect modest consolidated operating margin improvement  given our current revenue and expense expectations  and we expect that general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total operated revenue will be consistent with as part of our long term strategy  we intend to continue to selectively pursue acquisitions 
our portfolios as of december   our consolidated portfolio had a capacity of approximately  beds in states  and our operated portfolio had a capacity of approximately  beds in states

significant transactions during   and  we entered into a number of transactions that affected the number of communities we own  lease  and manage  our financing arrangements  and our capital structure 
these transactions are summarized below 
our most significant transaction in recent years affecting the number of communities that we operate was our participation in the sunwest jv  which commenced operations in august in january  we entered into the sunwest jv with affiliates of blackstone and columbia pacific 
during the last half of  the sunwest jv acquired communities previously operated by sunwest  of which we currently manage communities 
we entered into management agreements with the sunwest jv to manage the portfolio of communities for a fee equal to of gross collected revenues 
in june  we acquired blackstone s ownership interest in communities that we managed on behalf of the blackstone jv  a previously unconsolidated joint venture in which emeritus owned and blackstone owned of the ownership interests

results of operations sources of revenues as described in detail in item business  we generate revenues by providing senior housing and related healthcare services to the senior population 
we are the largest provider of assisted living and memory care services in the united states  with a capacity for approximately  residents 
assisted living and memory care units comprise approximately of our total operated portfolio 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and the two basic drivers of our community revenues are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
in evaluating the rate component  we utilize the average monthly revenue per occupied unit  computed by dividing the total operating revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we track the average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
private pay residents represent of our payor mix 
we believe that only residents with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities  and that the rates we charge and our occupancy levels are interrelated 
therefore  we continuously evaluate rate and occupancy in each community to find the optimal balance so that we can benefit from our increasing capacity and anticipated future occupancy increases 
although our business is primarily needs driven  we believe that our occupancy growth has been slowed due to the ongoing economic downturn  as some seniors and their families have postponed moves for financial reasons  and we believe that high unemployment has enabled family members and others to provide home care for seniors 
revenues from government reimbursement programs  which are the federal medicare and state medicaid programs  represented of our community revenues in compared to in and in this increase is due primarily to the lease acquisition of communities in november that included skilled nursing units  most of which receive medicare reimbursement 
future changes in revenues from medicare and medicaid programs in our existing communities will depend upon factors that include resident mix  levels of acuity among our residents  overall occupancy and government reimbursement rates 
there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future 
on july   cms issued its final rule reducing medicare reimbursement rates by an average of  which took effect on october  although we believe that we can offset a portion of the decrease through cost savings and improved occupancy in our skilled nursing operations  the potential impact of the lower reimbursement levels totals approximately million annually  beginning with the october  effective date 
we are currently unable to estimate the potential impact of other possible governmental cost containment measures 
we also earn management fee revenues by managing certain communities for third parties  including communities owned by related parties and by joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest 
the majority of our management agreements provide for fees equal to of gross collected revenues 
same community portfolio of the communities included in our consolidated portfolio as of december   we include communities in our same community portfolio

liquidity and capital resources the united states economy experienced a significant decline in the housing market  significant declines in consumer confidence  and a related weakness in the availability and affordability of credit during that led to the economic recession that continued into with only moderate signs of a recovery during and we believe that the recovery is likely to continue to be slow in however  we believe that the needs driven demand for our services continues to grow and remains resilient due  in large part  to an increasingly aging population as well as limited new senior living construction  as evidenced by our relative stability in same community occupancy and improvements in average rates 
at december   we had cash on hand of million compared to million at december  the company has incurred significant operating losses since its inception  and we had working capital deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deficit increased primarily because we used cash in to invest in community acquisitions and property and equipment 
due to the nature of our business  it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because we collect revenues much more quickly  often in advance  than we are required to pay obligations  and we have historically refinanced or extended maturities of debt obligations as they become current liabilities 
our operations result in a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities 
along those lines  the working capital deficit as of december  included a million deferred tax asset and  as part of current liabilities  million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income 
a million deferred tax liability is included in other long term liabilities 
we do not expect the level of current liabilities to change from period to period in such a way as to require the use of significant cash  except for million in scheduled balloon payments of principal on long term debt maturing during the next months  which is included in current portion of long term debt as of december  we intend to refinance  extend  or retire these obligations prior to their maturities 
given the continuing instability in worldwide credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such refinancing or be able to retire the obligations 
sources and uses of cash we expect to use our cash to invest in our core business as well as other new business opportunities related to our core business 
as discussed above  we expect to refinance or extend our balloon payments in  however  if we are unable to do so  we believe the company would be able to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operating and investing activities and financing obligations for at least the next months by conserving its capital expenditures and operating expenses or selling communities or a combination thereof 
in connection with emeritus guarantees of certain debt and lease agreements  we are required at all times to maintain a minimum million balance of unencumbered liquid assets  defined as cash  cash equivalents and or publicly traded quoted marketable securities 
as a result  million of our cash on hand is not available to fund operations and we take this into account in our cash management activities 
we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method investees 
we may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth strategy 
significant acquisitions and or other new business opportunities will likely require additional outside funding 
we do not plan to pay cash dividends to our common shareholders in the foreseeable future 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and other than normal operating expenses  we expect that cash requirements for will consist primarily of capital expenditures 
we expect to increase expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of existing communities  systems and technology investments in the communities and in the support infrastructure

we used cash in investing activities during primarily for the acquisition of the blackstone jv communities  which amounted to million net of million of cash acquired and including million from additional borrowings  the purchase of six other communities  which amounted to million  and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of communities and investment securities totaling million 
in  we paid million to purchase communities 
in addition  we used cash in investing activities primarily for our investments in joint ventures  net of distributions  which amounted to million  and capital expenditures of million 
we obtained cash from financing activities primarily as a result of borrowing million during the current period to purchase communities  of which million was related to the blackstone jv acquisition  and million to refinance existing debt 
we used cash in financing activities in the current period primarily for principal payments  debt refinancings  and early retirement of long term debt  as well as principal payments on capital leases 
in addition  we paid million to purchase mr 
baty s equity interest in certain communities previously owned by our consolidated joint venture see note  which amount is classified as a distribution to noncontrolling interest 
in the prior year period  cash used in financing activities was primarily for principal payments on long term debt and capital leases 
in november  we received net cash proceeds of million from the public offering of our common stock 
also in  we borrowed million to finance the purchase of three communities

financial covenants and cross defaults many of our debt instruments  leases  and corporate guarantees contain financial covenants that require that the company maintain specified financial criteria as of the end of each reporting period 
these financial covenants generally prescribe operating performance metrics such as debt or lease coverage ratios  operating income yields  fixed charge coverage ratios and or minimum occupancy requirements 
others are based on financial metrics such as minimum cash or net worth balances or have material adverse change clauses 
remedies available to the counterparties to these arrangements in the event of default vary but include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of debt or lease payments  and or the termination of related lease agreements 
in addition  many of the lease and debt instruments contain cross default provisions whereby a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations 
accordingly  an event of default could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition if a lender or landlord exercised its rights under an event of default 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and as of december   the company had approximately billion of mortgage debt and notes payable outstanding comprised of the following mortgage debt financed through freddie mac and fannie mae of approximately billion  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were issued to single purpose entities spes and are secured by the assets of each spe  which consists of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally nonrecourse debt to the company in that only the assets or common stock of the spe are available to the lender in the event of default  with some limited exceptions 
these debt obligations do not contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants but do contain typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the institution of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
these debt instruments typically contain cross default provisions  which are limited to other related loans provided by the specific lender 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payment of the related obligations 
mortgage debt financed primarily through traditional financial lending institutions of approximately million  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations were incurred to facilitate community acquisitions over the past few years  were typically issued to and secured by the assets of each spe  which consist of the real and personal property and intangible assets of a single community 
the debt is generally recourse debt to the company in that not only are the assets or common stock of each spe available to the lender in the event of default  but the company has guaranteed performance of each spe s obligations under the mortgage 
these debt obligations generally contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants  such as debt service coverage ratios  operating income yields  occupancy requirements  and or net operating income thresholds 
the company s guarantees generally contain requirements to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
in addition  the mortgages contain other typical events of default such as nonpayment of monetary obligations  failure to maintain insurance coverage  fraud and or misrepresentation of facts  unauthorized sale or transfer of assets  and the institution of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
these debt instruments may contain cross default provisions  but are limited to other loans provided by the specific lender 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payment of the related obligations 
mezzanine debt financing in the amount of million provided by real estate investment trusts reits to facilitate community acquisitions  or approximately of our total debt outstanding 
these obligations are generally unsecured or are secured by mortgages on leasehold interests in community lease agreements between the specific reit and the company  and performance under the debt obligations is guaranteed by the company 
the company guaranty generally contains a requirement to maintain minimum cash and or net worth balances 
typical events of default under these obligations include nonpayment of monetary obligations  events of default under related lease agreements  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
remedies under an event of default include the acceleration of payments of the related obligations 
as of december   we operated communities under long term lease arrangements  of which were leased from publicly traded reits 
of the leased properties  contain provisions requiring ongoing maintenance of specific financial covenants  such as rent coverage ratios 
other typical events of default under these leases include nonpayment of rents or other monetary obligations  events of default under related lease agreements  and the commencement of legal proceedings under bankruptcy 
remedies in these events of default vary but generally include the requirement to post a security deposit in specified amounts  acceleration of lease payments  and or the termination of the related lease agreements 
additionally  our debt and lease agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between and per unit bed per year for community maintenance 
historically  we have spent in excess of these per 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and unit bed amounts  however  there is no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit bed amounts in the future 
if we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts  we will be in default of the applicable debt or lease agreement  which could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding debt and lease arrangements 
as of december   we were in violation of financial covenants in a debt agreement covering three communities with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million 
we obtained a waiver from the lender through december  and  as such  are currently in compliance 
as required  we will test for compliance again on the next measurement date of march  this loan matures in november and we are in negotiations to refinance it 
in addition  we were in violation of a financial covenant in master lease agreements covering communities 
we obtained a waiver from the lessor through june  and  as such  are currently in compliance

summary of critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in our reporting materially different amounts under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our accounting policies regarding investments in joint ventures  asset impairments  goodwill impairment  stock based compensation  leases  self insurance reserves  and income taxes are the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in our preparation of our financial statements 
those financial statements reflect our revisions to such estimates in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note  description of the business  basis of presentation  and summary of significant accounting policies 
investments in joint ventures we have investments in joint ventures with equity interests ranging from to 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that at the time we enter into a joint venture  we must determine whether the joint venture is a variable interest entity and  if so  whether we are the primary beneficiary and thus required to consolidate the entity 
in performing this analysis  we consider various factors such as the amount of our ownership interest  our voting rights  the extent of our power to direct matters that significantly impact the entity s activities  and our participating rights 
we must also reevaluate each joint venture s status quarterly or whenever there is a change in circumstances such an increase in the entity s activities  assets  or equity investments  among other things 
asset impairments when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment 
we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated future cash flows undiscounted 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset s estimated fair value 
for community assets  the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future revenues and operating costs  using internal projections 
for our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  we determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of the investment by using a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of individual assets inside the joint venture 
for our investments in marketable equity securities  we must make a judgment as to whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary 
for other assets  we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances 
our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting asset useful lives 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and further  our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that goodwill carrying values may exceed their fair values 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value  an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value 
in  we early adopted accounting standards update no 
 testing goodwill for impairment asu 
this revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing companies with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a further impairment test is necessary 
as a result  we first assess a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments  and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance when evaluating potential impairment for goodwill 
if  after completing such assessment  it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment test  whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired and the second step of the test is not performed 
the second step of the impairment test is performed when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  in which case the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
emeritus is comprised of a single reporting unit 
we performed our qualitative assessment as of october  and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its applicable carrying value 
accordingly  it was not necessary to perform the two step impairment test and no goodwill impairment was recognized in our impairment loss assessment contains uncertainties because it requires us to apply judgment to estimate whether there has been a decline in the fair value of our company reporting unit  including estimating future cash flows  and if necessary  the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
as we periodically perform this assessment  changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future 
stock based compensation we measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period 
for stock options  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation  however  a change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year the company s restricted stock awards vest only upon the achievement of performance targets 
gaap requires recognition of compensation cost only when achievement of performance conditions is considered probable 
consequently  our determination of the amount of stock compensation expense requires a significant level of 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and judgment in estimating the probability of achievement of these performance targets 
additionally  we must make estimates regarding employee forfeitures in determining compensation expense 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
leases we determine whether to account for our leases as operating  capital  or financing leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated communities under long term leases with operating  capital  and financing lease obligations 
the determination of this classification under gaap is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair value of the leased communities  minimum lease payments  effective cost of funds  the economic life of the community  and certain other terms in the lease agreements 
self insurance reserves we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks  including workers compensation  healthcare benefits  professional and general liability  property insurance  and director and officers liability insurance 
we are self insured for professional liability risk with respect to of the communities in our consolidated portfolio 
the other communities are insured with conventional indemnity policies 
the liability for self insured known claims and incurred but not yet reported claims was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses as of december   based on sensitivity testing of the various underlying actuarial assumptions  is approximately million to million 
the high end of the range reflects the potential for high severity losses 
we are self insured for workers compensation risk except in texas  washington  and ohio up to  per claim through a high deductible  collateralized insurance program 
the liability for self insured known claims and incurred but not yet reported claims was million and million at december  and  respectively  which is included in accrued employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the range of reasonably possible losses as of december   based on sensitivity testing of the various underlying actuarial assumptions  is approximately million to million 
for health insurance  we self insure each participant up to  or  per year  depending upon the particular coverage plan  above which a catastrophic insurance policy covers any additional costs 
the liability for self insured incurred but not yet reported claims is included in accrued employee compensation and benefits in the consolidated balance sheets and was million and million at december  and  respectively 
a change in the estimated liability at december  would have increased or decreased operated portfolio expenses during by approximately  we share any revisions to prior estimates with the communities participating in the insurance programs  including those that we manage for third parties such as the sunwest jv  based on their proportionate share of any changes in estimates 
accordingly  the impact of changes in estimates on our consolidated income from operations would be less sensitive than the difference indicated above 
liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by emeritus are not discounted and we estimate them  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
for professional liability and workers compensation claims  we engage third party actuaries to assist us in estimating the related liabilities 
in doing so  we record liabilities for estimated losses for both known claims and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates are based on historical paid and incurred losses and ultimate losses using several actuarial methods 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
changes in self insurance reserves are recorded as an increase or decrease to expense in the period that the determination is made 

table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and in march  congress enacted health care reform legislation  referred to as the affordable care act aca  which we believe will increase our costs to provide healthcare benefits 
the specific provisions of the aca will be phased in over time through  unless modifying legislation is passed before some of the provisions become effective 
the aca did not have a material financial impact on our company in although there are additional expenses that will be incurred in  we do not expect that the aca will result in a material increase in our operating expenses in however  we could see significant cost increases beginning in when certain provisions of the legislation are required to be implemented 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse 
we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and record a valuation allowance if  based on all available evidence  we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized 
as of december   we have established a valuation allowance such that our net deferred tax asset is zero 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information becomes available 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation  the status of various income tax audits  and our particular facts and circumstances 
we believe that our estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates

impact of inflation inflation could affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
the near term negative economic outlook in the united states may impact our ability to raise prices 
in recent years  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial position  revenues  income from continuing operations or cash flows 
we do not expect inflation affecting the us dollar to materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the foreseeable future

definition of adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss adjusted for the following items depreciation and amortization  interest income  interest expense  net equity earnings or losses for unconsolidated joint ventures  provision for income taxes  loss from discontinued operations  certain noncash revenues and expenses  and acquisition  development  and financing expenses 
we define adjusted ebitdar as adjusted ebitda plus community lease expense  net of amortization of above below market rents and deferred straight line rent 
management s use of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar are commonly used performance metrics in the senior living industry 
we use adjusted ebitda ebitdar to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are useful in identifying trends in our financial performance because they exclude items that have little or no significance to our day to day operations 
these measures provide an assessment of controllable expenses and afford management the ability to make decisions  which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals  as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
these measures also provide indicators for management to determine if adjustments to current spending levels are needed 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar provide us with measures of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  interest expense  and lease expense associated with our capital structure 
these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are some of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar have limitations as analytical tools 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our losses to calculate adjusted ebitda ebitdar and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net loss include the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda ebitdar generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant effect on our financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly affecting our current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties 
if the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our financial position and results of operations 
we use these non gaap measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not alternatives to net loss  loss from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda ebitdar as substitutes for any such gaap financial measure

we define cffo  as adjusted  as cffo adjusted for self insurance reserve adjustments related to prior years and unusual income tax benefits 
recurring routine capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from cffo 
amounts excluded from recurring routine capital expenditures consist primarily of community acquisitions  including expenditures incurred in the months immediately following acquisition  new construction and expansions  computer hardware and software purchases  and purchases of vehicles 
management s use of cash from facility operations we use cffo to assess our overall liquidity and to determine levels of executive compensation 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords us the ability to make decisions that facilitate meeting our current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for us to determine if we need to make adjustments to our current spending decisions 
this metric measures our overall liquidity based on operational factors that we can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cffo is one of the metrics used by us and our board of directors i to review our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities and long term leases  ii to assess our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities on a period to period basis  iii for planning purposes  including preparation of our 
table of contents emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december    and annual budget  iv in setting various covenants in our credit agreements  and v in determining levels of executive compensation 
limitations of cash from facility operations cffo has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of cash flows from operating activities 
cffo does not represent cash available for discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
we believe cffo is useful to investors because it assists in their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness  including our credit facilities and capital and financing leases  and our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities 
cffo is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cffo as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net cash provided by operating activities to cffo  along with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business
